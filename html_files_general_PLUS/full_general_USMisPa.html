                class="innerpar"> In the Mississippian region (Midwest and Upland South) the transition from atlatl to
            bow was "relatively rapid because dart points disappear from the archaeological record"
            [MAJIDBENAM_REF_8]<br class="innerpar"> Introduction of the bow in the Mississippi region decreased social
            complexity because it caused the collapse of the Hopewell system, the abandonment of mound centers and
            alliance-exchange relationships [MAJIDBENAM_REF_9]<br class="innerpar"> Bow enabled a new bow and native
            crops subsistence strategy which lead to a movement to and the effective exploitation of previously marginal
            lands and "household autonomy" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_10]<br class="innerpar"> There followed an economic
            intensification and population growth which eventually "packed the landscape with settlements."

            has long been accepted as evidence of the bow, but variation in the morphology of late arrow point types
            suggest that this transition was governed by social and historical factors that varied across these
            regions." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12]<br class="innerpar"> Late arrowheads may indicate the technological
            development of fletching as they are less heavy and thick than the early arrowheads. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_13]<br
                class="innerpar"> First evidence of intergroup violence appears in the archaeological record
            (arrowpoints embedded in skeletons in individual and group burials). [MAJIDBENAM_REF_14]<br
                class="innerpar"> No evidence for an increase in social complexity and hierarchy or deviation from the
            "trend toward household autonomy" at this time. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_15]<br class="innerpar"> "For the first
            time, there is evidence, in the form of group and individual burials with embedded arrow points, of the bow
            as the primary weapon of intergroup violence." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_16]<br class="innerpar"> "In Middle Woodland
            times there isn’t much evidence for warfare." "Later, after about A.D. 600 there is more evidence (scalping,
            embedded arrow points)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_17]<br class="innerpar"> "Population growth, reduced access to
            resources, sedentism, and the desire to avoid conflict made the high costs of intensified food production
            more attractive." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_18]</div><br class="innerpar"> 700 CE<br class="innerpar"> 800 CE<div>
            Intensification of Maize farming begins. Higher yields from maize cultivation enables more food to be
            extracted from a smaller territory. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_19]<br class="innerpar"> "Although there is scattered
            evidence for corn, or maize, during Middle Woodland times, it wasn't until Late Woodland times, after AD
            700-800, that it became an important food crop." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_20]<br class="innerpar"> Social complexity
            increases from this period. "Site plans gained greater internal complexity as houses clustered into
            court-yard groups and, toward [1000 CE], the southern pattern of civic-ceremonial centers with large earthen
            mounds was established in many places. Nucleated settlements may have been a defensive response to bow
            warfare. Burials with embedded arrow points and sites fortified with palisades and ditches are widespread,
            although no present everywhere... New social roles linked to community defense, organization of labor, and
            communal storage of maize in secure central places laid the foundation for the increased group
            differentiation, competition, and hierarchy of the Mississippian period beginning A.D. 1000."
            [MAJIDBENAM_REF_21]<br class="innerpar"> Palisades and ditches appear in the archaeological record. The
            first evidence of substantial intergroup warfare. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_22]</div><br class="innerpar">"trail
        networks also are important, and some of the historic east-west ones cross near Cahokia."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23]<br
            class="innerpar">Cahokia "controlled a critical choke point in trade routes that spanned the midcontinent"
        an idea that goes back to Brackenridge (1813 CE).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24]<br class="innerpar">"The greatest
        environmental hazard would have been a late summer Mississippi River flood similar to the one that took place in
        1993. A rise in the river at that time of the year simultaneously drowned crops, prevented easy fishing in
        shallow ponds, and ruined food stored in underground pits. Floods attributable to severe storms, including
        excessive water funnelled into the floodplain by creeks that drain the uplands, certainly caused localized
        disasters much like they did a century ago before effective flood-control measures were put in place."
        [MAJIDBENAM_REF_25]<br class="innerpar">"No other major site was as advantageously situated. Cahokia was located
        in what was by far the widest expanse of land suitable for settlement in the American Bottom. More people could
        live there than anywhere else ... The high ground where Cahokia was located was bordered on the north and south
        by large tracts of low-lying land that received the waters of different upland streams."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26]
