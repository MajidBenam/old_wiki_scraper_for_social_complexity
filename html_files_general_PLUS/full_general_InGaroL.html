The Garo Hills district is bounded by Goalpara and part of the Mymensing district of East Pakistan on the north and the west, by Mymensing on the south, and by the Khasi and Jaintia Hills district on the east. The district covers an area of 3,160.6 square miles and has a population of 2,42,075 according to the 1951 census; of this population 1,90,702 are Garos while the rest are non-Garos.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_InGaroL] ‘The Garo Hills, the main homeland of the Garos, is the south-western district of Assam. Its area is about 3,152 sq. miles, and its population according to the 1951 census is 2,42,075 including the non-Garo population. The total Garo population of the district is 1,97,077 of whom 1,02,821 are males and 94,256 females. The area lies between 25 ° 57′ 18″ and 25 ° 9′ 20″ north latitude and 91 ° 0′ 0″ and 90 ° 0′ 10″ east longitude.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_InGaroL] Due to the post-independence administrative reorganization of the region, the Garo Hills districts now belong to the state of Meghalaya, bordering Assam: ‘The two Garo Hills districts are situated between 25 degrees, 9 minutes and 26 degrees, 1 minute north latitude and 89 degrees, 49 minutes and 91 degrees, 2 minutes east longitude, covering an area of 8,000 square kilometers. The districts border Bangladesh on the south and west and Assam on the north. Hills cover most of the district, with plains along the fringes. There are a number of hilly streams and rivers; excepting for the Simsang River which forms a wide flood plain none is navigable. The monsoon area produces a thick vegetation on the hills.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_InGaroL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Original name ♣ A’chik; Mande ♥</b> 'Garo' is the most frequently used term in the ethnographic literature. However, A'chik is the preferred self-designated term. Therefore, out of respect, we generally prefer “A'chik” instead of "Garo", except for source titles and direct quotations. ‘The Garos constitute one of the most important tribal communities in East and West Garo Hills. The Garos call themselves  A’chik (Hill man),  Mande (Man) or  A’chik Mande. Ethnically, the Garos belong the the Tibeto-Burman race, whose cradle is said to have been North-West China, between the upper waters of Yang-tse Kiang and Hoang-Ho. The Garos have a close affinity with the Bodos, Kacharis, Kochs and such allied tribes of Assam valley.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_InGaroL] ‘As stated earlier, the Garos prefer to call themselves as “A’chik or A’chik manderang” and as such, the appropriate term for their land will be “A’chik A’song” or “A’chik Land”.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_InGaroL] ‘The word ‘Mande’ generally indicated ‘human being’ to differentiate from other beings as ‘Mande or Matburung’ (man or animal) and “Mande or Me’mang” (man or ghost). It is exceptionally used in rare cases to indicate the whole community from others like ‘Mandema ba Rori’ ‘Mandema Nepali’ that is whether hill man or plain people and Nepali. But it is not commonly used for the whole community. A’chik is suffixed by the word Mande as “A’chik manderang”, and in short form as “A’chikrang”.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_InGaroL] The term 'Garo' is not used as an ethnonym by the people themselves: ‘There remains an obscurity about the origin of the word 'Garo.' They are known as 'Garos' to outsiders; but the Garos always designate themselves as 'Achik' ('hill man').’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_InGaroL] Many members of the group self-define as Garo when talking to outsiders, but it can also be used as an offensive term (seems to depend on tone and context).

The word ‘Garo’ has two morphemes, Gar + o and meaning ‘one who has left’ or ‘separated’. The Lexico Statistical Dating Analysis conducted by Robbins Burling and P.C.

The Empire peaked in the 19th century, in the last quarter of which the Garo Hills were incorporated into the British colonial structure. The British sent punitive campaigns into the hills in order to suppress resistance as well as infighting. Administrative control was established around 1873. Most authors consider the area 'pacified' for the remainder of the colonial period. 'The 19th century marked the full flower of the British Empire. Administration and policy changed during the century from the haphazard arrangements of the 17th and 18th centuries to the sophisticated system characteristic of Joseph Chamberlain’s tenure (1895-1900) in the Colonial Office. That office, which began in 1801, was first an appendage of the Home Office and the Board of Trade, but by the 1850s it had become a separate department with a growing staff and a continuing policy; it was the means by which discipline and pressure were exerted on the colonial governments when such action was considered necessary. [...] In the wake of the Indian Mutiny (1857), the British crown assumed the East India Company’s governmental authority in India. Britain’s acquisition of Burma (Myanmar) was completed in 1886, while its conquest of the Punjab (1849) and of Balochistān (1854-76) provided substantial new territory in the Indian subcontinent itself. The French completion of the Suez Canal (1869) provided Britain with a much shorter sea route to India. Britain responded to this opportunity by expanding its port at Aden, establishing a protectorate in Somaliland (now Somalia), and extending its influence in the sheikhdoms of southern Arabia and the Persian Gulf. Cyprus, which was, like Gibraltar and Malta, a link in the chain of communication with India through the Mediterranean, was occupied in 1878. Elsewhere, British influence in the Far East expanded with the development of the Straits Settlements and the federated Malay states, and in the 1880s protectorates were formed over Brunei and Sarawak.'

In 1775-76 the Zamindars of Mechpara and Karaibari (at present in the Goalpara and Dhubri districts of Assam) led expeditions onto the Garo hills. The first contact with British colonialists was in 1788, and the area was brought under administrative control in the year 1873.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_InGaroL] During the 19th century, the Indian subcontinent was subject to increasing colonial influence, ‘a process that culminated in the decline of the ruling Muslim elite and absorption of the subcontinent within the British Empire. Direct administration by the British, which began in 1858, effected a political and economic unification of the subcontinent. When British rule came to an end in 1947, the subcontinent was partitioned along religious lines into two separate countries-India, with a majority of Hindus, and Pakistan, with a majority of Muslims; the eastern portion of Pakistan later split off to form Bangladesh. Many British institutions stayed in place (such as the parliamentary system of government)’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_InGaroL] The British sent punitive campaigns into the hills in order to suppress resistance as well as infighting.

These are geographic subtribes, but are also dialectal and subcultural groups. According to their beliefs and religion, the Garos are divided into the SONGSAREK (following their indigenous beliefs and practices) and the Christians.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_InGaroL] During the colonial period, a British administrative structure was superimposed on the native population, but the latter largely continued to regulate local matters according to A’chik laws and institutions: ‘Garo tribe inhabit the Garo Hills district in the state of Meghalaya. The district used to be administered as a ‘partially excluded area’ by the Deputy Commissioner under the executive orders of the British Government during the British rule. The tribal ways of life, community ownership and use of land and the administration of the society according to the traditional laws and customs were least interfered with overtly under the British Administration.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_InGaroL] The A’chik retained some autonomy under Indian rule as well: ‘The history of Khasi, and Jaintia hills and its people can be found from the early part of the sixteenth century, as prior to this neither the records nor traditions reveal any substantial information. Moderately large changes were brought forth through development of the settlements and the formation of the Khasi and the Jaintia Hill district in the year 1835 and the Garo district in the year 1866. The capital of these provinces was Cherrapunji in 1827 which later on was shifted to Shillong in 1864. The prevailing groups in the State are the Khasi, Jaintia and Garo. In an amendment made recently in the provision of Scheduled Tribe in the Constitution of India, the Rabha, the Bodo-Kachari and the Koch have been given the status of Scheduled Tribe in the State.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_InGaroL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ vassalage ♥</b> SCCS variable 84 'Higher Political Organization' is coded 'International organization', not 'Absent', 'Peace group', 'Alliances', or 'Confederation'.

The Bodo dominated in the plains of Garo Hills and the North Cachar Hills. They were later subdivided into Garo, Kachari, Mech, Dimasa, Tippera, Lalung, Chutiya and Rabha groups (Barkakati 1969).

Garos of the adjoining areas had to struggle constantly with these Zeminders. Whenever the employees of the Zeminders tried to collect taxes or to oppress the Garo in some way or other, they retaliated by coming down to the plains and murdering ryots of the Zeminders. In 1775-76 the Zeminders of Mechpara and Karaibari led expeditions to the hills near about their Zeminderies and subjugated a portion of what is at present the Garo Hills district.

This contains provisions for the constitution of village councils, District Council Courts, Subordinate District Council Courts and  Village Courts with powers and jurisdiction to try suits and cases.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_InGaroL] Garo Hills district was initially administered as part of the state of Assam: ‘Till 1969, the Garo Hills District was part of state of Assam but in that year an autonomous State of Meghalaya was formed within the State of Assam as provided by section 3(1) of Assam Reorganization (Meghalaya) Act, 1969 (55 of 1969). In pursuance of that Act, the Rules of 1937 and 1953 were adopted by the Meghalaya Adaptation of Laws (whole paragraph no. 1) of 1973 issued under section 79 of that Act. The Government of Assam acting under paragraph 4(3) of Sixth Schedule to the Constitution of India, issued the Assam High Court (Jurisdiction over District Council Courts) Order, 1954. The order is material for ascertaining the position as to the appellate and revisional jurisdiction of the High Court of Gauhati, as regards to the Garo Hills district. This order is still in force (Sangma, J. 1973, p. 160-65).’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_InGaroL] ‘The state of Meghalaya comprises the Garo, Khasi and Jaintia Hills. It is a table land which is an extension of the massive block of Indian peninsular shield separated due to denudational and tectonic forces. Goalpara and Kamrup districts of Assam on the west borders the state on the north, whereas Bangladesh international border lies in the south and the Karbi Anglong borders in the East. There is no integrated historical account of the state as the inhabitants live in different tribal groups and have varied cultural and linguistic patterns. They till recently lived in physical isolation. […] The Garo Hills became a part of Meghalaya State after the formation of Meghalaya as a state of Union of India in early 1970s.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_InGaroL] ‘The prevailing groups in the State are the Khasi, Jaintia and Garo.

They are one of the best known matrilineal groups in India. Here the Garos are not the only aboriginal tribe--they are the MAJOR aboriginal tribe. Others are the Hajong, the Koch, the Rabha, the Dalau, and the Banais who reside on the adjacent plains of the neighboring district. There remains an obscurity about the origin of the word 'Garo.' They are known as 'Garos' to outsiders; but the Garos always designate themselves as 'Achik' ('hill man'). The Garos are divided into nine subtribes: the Awe, Chisak, Matchi-Dual, Matabeng, Ambeng, Ruga-Chibox, Gara-Ganching, Atong, and the Megam. These are geographic subtribes, but are also dialectal and subcultural groups.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_InGaroL] ‘Linguistic affinities and personal traits clearly show that the Garos are only a division of the great Bodo race of Assam. The Bodos were spread, as at present, throughout the whole of the Brahmaputra valley as well as in North Bengal. Aryans are now generally believed to have entered into Assam by two routes, one leading from the west through the Gangetic valley and the other through the Himalayas along the courses of the rivers entering Assam. The Bodos who were the earlier inhabitants of the province also came here in different hordes and following different routes from the north-west as well as from the north-east. It  may be supposed that the Bodos, before entering into Assam and North Bengal which might have been then a part of Assam (Kamrupa of Old), divided themselves into groups somewhere in the Himalayan kingdom of Tibet. I think the ancestors of the Garos of Assam came down from Tibet to Bhutan and thence by following the course of the river Sonkos and her tributaries to Dhubri (now headquarters of the district of Goalpara) and this might be the latest migration of the people of the Bodo race into Assam and North Bengal. These people then crossed the Brahmaputra at different points and populated the southern parts of Goalpara, the northern and the western parts of the Garo Hills and then gradually they spread in the entire Garo Hills and some parts of the Kamrup district.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_InGaroL] ’Linguistically and ethnologically, the Garos belong to the Bodo family, who were one-time occupants of a large part of the Brahmaputra valley but were probably pushed into the hills by later invaders. The Garos strongly believe that their ancestors came from Tibet and settled in Cooch Behar for about 400 years.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_InGaroL] ‘The denomination of these linguistic speakers was subsequently driven away by the Tibeto- Burman hordes into Khasi Hills and the Jaintia Hills.

The Hajong have adopted the Jharua dialect of Assamese and have been greatly Hinduized. The Dalu are closely akin to the Hajong but they are recent migrants from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). These people inhabit the outer fringes of the district extending to the adjacent areas of the neighbouring plains districts. They are in occupation of the fertile agricultural lands suitable for wet paddy cultivation.

Some of these people have identified with the settlers of the soil and have even contributed much to the prosperity of the province but the only purpose of many of these outsiders is to create differences and mistrusts among her own people and thus exploit them fully.

There were periodic raids from the hills that could not be effectively controlled. For many years administration of the Garo Hills was delayed by the extremely serious malaria which was, and still is, characteristic of the district. Finally, however, in 1867, the district was occupied, permanent headquarters were established at Tura, and peace was rapidly achieved. The American Baptist Missionary Society sent missionaries to the Garo Hills almost immediately after the government was established, and these were followed, in this century, by Catholic missionaries, with the result that today between one-quarter and one-third of the Garos are Christians, the largest number of them Baptist.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_47_InGaroL] ‘Tura is the only town in the district. It is the administrative headquarters of the Garo Hills district. According to 1961 Census, it had a population of 8,888 out of which 4,370 were Garo. Tura is linked with the plains of Assam by three major roads; one enters the district near its north-eastern corner and traverses the district almost diagonally half-way; the other two roads enter the district through the north-western corner and one traverses the district south-eastwardly diagonally half-way, and the other follows the western border of the district, but from the middle of the western border line enters Tura from an westerly direction.

This modified form of language used in literature is understood by all and is easier for communication among the different subtribes.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_51_InGaroL]</div><div class='meatypart'></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Sino-Tibetan ♥</b> The A’chik language is often referred to as 'Garo' by scholars. ‘The Garos living in the East and West Garo Hills districts of Meghalaya in northeastern India speak the Garo dialect. They are one of the best known matrilineal groups in India.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_52_InGaroL] ‘According to Sir George Grierson's classification in the LINGUISTIC SURVEY OF INDIA, Garo belongs to the Bodo subsection of the Bodo-Naga Section, under the Assam-Burma Group of the Sino-Tibetan or Tibeto-Burman Language Family.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_53_InGaroL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Garo Hills, located in Meghalaya in northeast India, have long been inhabited by the A’chik. The term 'Garo' is of unclear origin, but is believed to have originated with the neighbouring Boro people.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_54_InGaroL] The Garo people refer to themselves as the A'chik ('hill') or A'chik Manderang ('hill people').[MAJIDBENAM_REF_55_InGaroL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]It is unknown precisely when the A’chik settled in their present location, but it is believed that they migrated to the hills from Tibet.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_56_InGaroL] The A’chik had little contact with their neighbours before 1775, when local <i>zamindars</i> (Indian land-owning nobility) led expeditions into the Garo Hills.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_57_InGaroL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]1788 saw the first contact with the British, who began to occupy the district in 1867.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_58_InGaroL] Despite their initial resistance, the A’chik were overmatched by British firearms, and the British established full administrative control of the region around 1873.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_59_InGaroL] The region remained a part of British India until Indian independence in 1947.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]During the precolonial period, the A’chik lacked elaborate political organization. The most important social unit was the matrilineal clan, the <i>machong</i>.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_60_InGaroL] The chief (<i>nokma</i>) had relatively little power beyond religious functions and resolving minor disputes under the guidance of the village elders.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_61_InGaroL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Once the region was under British control, executive offices were simply superimposed onto A’chik structures. The British created the office of <i>laskar</i>, with limited power over about ten villages.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_62_InGaroL] The A’chik were still left to settle their own disputes through the nokma, but they gained the right to appeal the nokma's decisions to the court of laskars.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_63_InGaroL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Population estimates are unavailable for the precolonial period. The British colonial official and statistician W. W. Hunter estimated that the population of the Garo Hills was 80,000 in 1872.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_64_InGaroL]</div></body></html>
