In contrast to the Thutmosid Period, which was dominated by an administration located in Upper Egypt, the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties (known as the Rammeside period) were based in the Nile Delta region of Lower Egypt - first at Memphis, then at a new grand capital at Per-Ramesses.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The New Kingdom had a centralized administration that split the country under two viziers, who oversaw the Northern Tchety and Southern Tchety. Within these large units were nomarchs of nomes, village chiefs and local constables.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_EgNKRam] The important local officials were directly responsible to the bureau of the vizier, and they had to travel back and forth between the vizier's seat and their local posts in the course of their duties.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_EgNKRam] The draw of the centre both indicates the degree of power of the centralized administration and shows that the regions had the necessary administrative complexity to run themselves without the presence of their local ruler.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_EgNKRam][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Governmental administration during the later New Kingdom Dynasties was 'characterized by the growing strength of hereditary office', and the position of provincial nobles grew more secure.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_EgNKRam] During this period, the god Amun, the central deity of the priests at Thebes, became merged with the sun-god Ra and as Amun-Ra was worshipped throughout Egypt, including at Memphis. Rites connected with this 'king of gods' served to legitimize the rule of the Egyptian king on earth, who was believed to be the 'bodily son of Amun'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_EgNKRam][MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_EgNKRam] Government grants were bestowed on temples in return for 'formal blessings' for state activities.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_EgNKRam] However, the pharaoh's power to appoint the high priest was 'nominal', especially from the time of Ramesses III onwards,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_EgNKRam] and the priests of Karnak in Upper Egypt became powerful hereditary rulers who acted independently of the administration at Per-Ramesses in the delta.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_EgNKRam][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The city of Per-Ramesses, established around 1270 CE, had an immense population of about 250,000,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_EgNKRam] while the kingdom supported a peak total population of more than three million.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_EgNKRam]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Egypt New Kingdom ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ EgyptNew_1300BCE: 1293BCE-1201BCE; EgyptNew_1200BCE: 1200BCE-1101BCE; EgyptNew_1100BCE: 1100BCE-1070BCE ♥</b>  EgyptNew_1300BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_EgNKRam] EgyptNew_1200BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_EgNKRam] EgyptNew_1100BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_EgNKRam]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  931116: 1293BCE-1201BCE; 887893: 1200BCE-1101BCE; 825357: 1100BCE-1070BCE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Afro-Asiatic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Egyptian-Coptic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Egyptian (Ancient) ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Ancient Egyptian Religion ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Atenism ♥</b></div></body></html>
