There are many different types of chronology for this period, as it is based on a variant of the "Three Age System", and the dates are transferred from another region. Lack of exact information on the beginning date of the Middle period of the Chalcolithic era caused a 500-year gap between the Early and Middle Chalcolithic period. Also, the exact date of the end of the Late Chalcolithic and the start of the Bronze Age is not known. Based on data found in the literature, the duration of the Middle and Late Chalcocithic period in central Anatolia is dated to 5500-3000 BC. As already mentioned, those are contractual dates, transferred from other regions. It was not possible to determine the peak date for this period.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]C. Renfrew’s hypothesis states that people in this region and era were using a language of Indo-European origin. There are many variations of the Middle and Late Chalcolithic culture, which depended mostly on geographical factors and external influences (e.g. the position of the settlement, sources of raw materials , beliefs , etc.).[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Different groups and settlements reached the Early Bronze Age in many different ways. Archaeological sources show strong economic relationships between those settlements. Evidence for these relationships can be seen, among other kinds of proof, in some products, such as kitchen utensils, tools and materials used for manufacturing these.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Agriculture, hunting and gathering are seldom mentioned, due to the scarcity relevant research materials having been published throughout the years. Also, there is no information about farming techniques used by the Chalcolithic society. Their diet consisted mainly of plants grown next to their houses. Animal meat was consumed very rarely (some bones of both domesticated and wild animals have been found and there is evidence of fish and turtle consumption) .[MAJIDBENAM_BR]As was mentioned above, this era is considered as the dark ages. So, in order to obtain information about anything besides ceramics, a large number of publications had to be worked through. One of the issues that arose was that the sites that are considered Chalcolithic were studied in the late 60s of the last century and they resulted in rather poor quality information from those excavations. Also, due to Turkey’s ban on any foreign archaeological excavations in that area, it was nearly impossible to acquire any new samples for the analysis. The coding is mainly based on excavation reports, as the information in these has minimal additions from the writers.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Dead people were usually buried under the floors inside the houses - it can suggest that skeleton burial was in place. Bodies were very often tempered with - for example, laid on their side in a contracted position or hampered to fit into small pits. The dead were wearing jewelry upon the burial, and also had other grave goods, of which one of the most impressive was a bronze bracelet found with one of the skeletons (unfortunately, as no anthropomorphic studies very performed, we do not know what sex the buried person was). Very often, one grave had many bodies.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Artifacts resembling contemporary Balkan styles found at Çadır and similar regional sites may indicate that the peoples of the central plateau also had some contact with Southeast Europe"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_TrClcLT][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Used to cover walls and floors.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"In all Chalcolithic Age levels of Yumuktepe; baked clay spindle whorls and clay sling pallets are the dominant types.

Support and reinforcement was given to each wall by small beams measuring up to o-o8 m. in diameter. These were placed first horizontally close to the outer edge of the wall and parallel with it&nbsp;; then vertically, again near the two faces of the wall; and finally cross-wise through the wall.

Large free-standing one-room buildings - Can Hasan 1, Camhbel Tarlasi, Earlier also in Ikiztepe.Buildings built of mud brick, mud assumed. Brick or stone foundations situated on the mud. Use of wood to reinforce the structure. The construction of roofs was probably the same as in contemporary Can Hasan. Old walls were used to build new structures [MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_TrClcLT].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]markets present. We do not know whether they were polity owned or not. However, it is worth pointing out that something like this existed.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Probably found shop for renting cooking ware:[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Within were once wooden shelves holding dozens of vessels of all shapes and sizes, including Omphalos bowls with dimples in the bottom, a staple Çadır pottery tradition. Outside these buildings were large, apparently private, courtyard areas."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_TrClcLT][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Trade existed in the Midlle and Late Chalcolithic. Evidence for this can be found in the settlement of Çadır Höyük: "Frequented perhaps for a major local market or a bazaar for exotic trade goods."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_TrClcLT][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Shells[MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_TrClcLT][MAJIDBENAM_BR]River and volcanic stones served as polishers and grinders[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_TrClcLT].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Ivory (bracelet), Can Hasan[MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_TrClcLT][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"From various squares came about fifteen pieces of imported ware of the Mersin XXIII-XX range."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_TrClcLT][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br>In Çadır Höyük, a source was found for the production of pottery production.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_TrClcLT].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Interesting case is the miniature vessel found in Yumuktepe[MAJIDBENAM_REF_42_TrClcLT].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"In this layer a large number of very typical and almost identical pottery, found almost intact, was found which had been produced on both a fast wheel and by hand. These two standard types and similar pottery indicate that controlled mass production started in the Late Chalcolithic period. Also a potter placed a bead inside an intact vessel, for reasons which are unknown to us"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_43_TrClcLT][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Cloth-making present In Çadır Höyük found a source for the production of textile.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_44_TrClcLT][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Goldsmith/Silversmith present In Çadır Höyük, metal jewelry was found[MAJIDBENAM_REF_45_TrClcLT]. Copper or bronze bracelet was found in the grave (Can Hasan) [MAJIDBENAM_REF_46_TrClcLT].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Inside Çadır Höyük, a fairly well-provisioned house was found - the "burnt house" with a large courtyard and two stories. It had an assemblage indicative of craft activities such as stone tool production and textile production, as well as metal jewelry and a lot of pottery in its inventory[MAJIDBENAM_REF_47_TrClcLT].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Sources revealed during excavations at Can Hasan, (layer the middle Chalcolithic) show pieces of polychrome ware. Polychrome ware was produced only in Can Hasan[MAJIDBENAM_REF_48_TrClcLT].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]A large number of various shells were found. They made them into necklaces and earrings, possibly also applied on fabrics. The remains suggest that it housed a workshop (shells worked and unworked)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_49_TrClcLT].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"With the group of small objects in S 21 c was a large number of shells of several varieties The worked examples had been made into pendants of various types (P1. IIb-d, f) and into decorative elements with several piercings possibly for application to cloth. Others were unworked or partially worked and confirm the impression that this may be the remains of some kind of workshop"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_50_TrClcLT][MAJIDBENAM_BR]On the basis of sources, we can suggest there were workshops producing figurines of clay or stone. Examples of findings:[MAJIDBENAM_BR]-Two clay figures depicting women. Characteristic features are excessively elongated head and neck. Together exceed the height of the lower part of the body(Can Hasan)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_51_TrClcLT].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]-"The position of the better preserved is squatting with legs tucked underneath. The body is distinctly obese. On the head fragment the eyes, ears and nose are portrayed plastically but the mouth is not indicated. There is also a crown or headdress. The clay of these figurines is coarse, heavily tempered with straw&nbsp;; the surface was given a fine white slip and probably burnished. The neck and head of both examples had been built around a long rectangular peg, but there was apparently no cavity on the top of the head." (Can Hasan)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_52_TrClcLT][MAJIDBENAM_BR]-The upper part of the figure made of marble. Sex is not possible to confirm. Marble polished, detail shown through the incision(Late Chalcolithic, Can Hasan)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_53_TrClcLT].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]- Animal figurines, (Can Hasan)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_54_TrClcLT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_55_TrClcLT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_56_TrClcLT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_57_TrClcLT], (animal with horns sloping forward)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_58_TrClcLT].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Processing of obsidian was insignificant, but sifting the ground in a building in the square S26, there were found obsidian chips, flakes and blades, showing what tools were reworked in the building[MAJIDBENAM_REF_59_TrClcLT].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]There are no written sources to confirm the existence of the legal differences between people. Based on excavations, we can see social differentiation by differences in construction (residences[MAJIDBENAM_REF_60_TrClcLT]), quality of products, the distinction of sex (figures[MAJIDBENAM_REF_61_TrClcLT])., etc.</div></body></html>
