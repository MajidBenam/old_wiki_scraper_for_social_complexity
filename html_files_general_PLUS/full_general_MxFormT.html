The start date 650 BC for the MxFormT quasi-polity is the beginning of the Late Formative period (c.650-200 BC) in the Basin of Mexico (alternatively called "First Intermediate Period 2").[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_MxFormT] The end date is fuzzy and problematic because it is unclear exactly when in the Terminal Formative period (c.200-1 BC; alternatively called "First Intermediate Period 3") the entire MxFormT quasi-polity was conquered by its aggressive neighbors Cuicuilco (<a href="/w/index.php?title=Basin_of_Mexico-Cui&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Basin of Mexico-Cui (page does not exist)">Basin of Mexico-Cui</a>) and Teotihuacan (<a href="/w/index.php?title=Basin_of_Mexico-Teo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Basin of Mexico-Teo (page does not exist)">Basin of Mexico-Teo</a>). Since the MxFormT quasi-polity is made up of multiple, discrete, independent settlement clusters, the timing of their conquest by Cuicuilco and Teotihuacan was most likely different for different areas.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_MxFormT] This quasi-polity ceased to exist during the subsequent Tzacualli ceramic phase (c.1 BCE - 100 CE) because the Plinian eruption of Popocatepetl led to the abandonment of most of the quasi-polity', while the rest of the quasi-polity was taken over by Teotihuacan and Cuicuilco.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_MxFormT] The date ranges for the eruption/abandonment are c. 100 BCE - 50 CE, and the start date for the Tzacualli ceramic transition is centered around 1 BCE, so I use the date of 1 BCE to designate both events.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ quasi-polity ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> The settlement clusters of the MxFormT quasi-polity are thought to have been relatively independent and autonomous chiefdom-level polities during the Late Formative, but then gradually came under the control of neighboring Cuicuilco and Teotihuacan during the Terminal Formative c.200-1 BCE. While some have hypothesized that Cuicuilco headed some kind of Supra-polity political system during the Late Formative,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_MxFormT] the characteristics of such a Supra-polity political system are unknown to archaeologists.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ MxFormL ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b> Continuity in material culture, symbolic culture, settlement occupation, and subsistence practices.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ MxClass ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ Central Highland Mesoamerican Late-Terminal Formative ♥</b> Including the rest of the Basin of Mexico, the Puebla-Tlaxcalla Valley, Morelos, the Toluca Valley, and parts of Southern Puebla.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣ 40000 ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Otomanguean; Mixe-Zoquean ♥</b> The Basin of Mexico was a cultural crossroads during the Formative and Classic Periods, and their material culture has clear ties to both east (Puebla-Tlaxcalla, Eastern Moreos, Gulf Coast) and west (Michoacan/Guanajuato, Toluca Valley, Western Morelos). The (Proto-)Oto-Manguean language family spread northward into the NGA with the first farming populations, and there is cultural continuity throughout the Formative.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_MxFormT] Nevertheless, there were also considerable Olmec stylistic influences in the Basin of Mexico and Morelos (Chalcatzingo) during the Early-Middle Formative, which may indicate intrusive Mixe-Zoquean speakers.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_MxFormT] Due to the massive population movement from the Formative to the time of the Spanish Contact -- including the widespread displacement of local ethnic groups by Nahuatl-speaking Uto-Aztecans -- and the lack of a deciphered writing system in the Basin of Mexico NGA prior to Nahuatl, the language(s) of the MxFormT remain unknown.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_MxFormT] The material/symbolic culture of the MxFormT quasi-polity has strong links with the occupants of the Puebla-Tlaxcala Valley to the east, and later Teotihuacan (the so-called "Olmeca-Xicallanca" ethnie), and it has been suggested that these peoples spoke variants of Mixe-Zoquean and/or Totonac languages from the Gulf Coast (based on loan words in local Nahuat dialects).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_MxFormT] On the other hand, the local red-on-buff pottery tradition is shared across west-central Mexico, and there are clear stylistic and material culture ties between Cuicuilco and the Chupicuaro basin of southeast Guanajuato,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_MxFormT] which would suggest Oto-Pamean or proto-Purépecha/Tarrascan languages.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_MxFormT] Given the great miscegenation of cultural influences in the area, it is likely that multiple languages were spoken, likely leading to unique new cultures, languages, and ethnicities.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language Genus ♣ ♥</b><b>Religion</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious Tradition ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Sect ♣ ♥</b><b>Maps</b></div><div class="thumb tleft"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:182px;"><a href="/w/index.php?title=Special:Upload&amp;wpDestFile=Basin_of_Mexico_First_Intermediate_2color.png" class="new" title="File:Basin of Mexico First Intermediate 2color.png">File:Basin of Mexico First Intermediate 2color.png</a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><b>Late Formative Occupation c.650-200 BCE:</b> Total area of quasi-polity in Red; Individual Settlement Clusters in Blue; Cuicuilco polity in Green.

Here, we are interested in the phase of its prehistory known as the Terminal Formative period (c. 100 BCE-99 CE). The most notable aspect of this period is the emergence of Teotihuacan as the largest and most populous city in the New World: by 150 CE, it had a population ranging between 60,000 to 80,000 inhabitants distributed across an area of about 20 kilometers.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_MxFormT] [MAJIDBENAM_BR]Political power was inherently theocratic;[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_MxFormT] beyond that, the exact administrative mechanisms prevalent at the time remain unclear.</div></body></html>
