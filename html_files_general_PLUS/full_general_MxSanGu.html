Some neighbouring smaller settlements may have been influenced by people at San José Mogote, as suggested by the importing of limestone and travertine from up to 5km away, but there is otherwise little evidence for a unified polity.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_MxSanGu]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥</b> Residents at San José Mogote were the most numerous and hierarchically complex in the valley at this time, but relations with other settlements may only have extended as far as some smaller neighbouring ones for the purposes of importing limestone and travertine for construction at San José Mogote.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_MxSanGu]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ MxTieLa ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b> The population of the largest settlement, San José Mogote, grew substantially to over 1000 people during this period, [MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_MxSanGu] but there are few other settlements where this population could have migrated from.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ MxRosar ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ Early Formative ♥</b> The ceramic complex in the Valley of Oaxaca at this time resembled the ceramics of contemporary societies in Mesoamerica, including the Tlatilco in the Valley of Mexico Las Bocas in south-western Puebla, Chiapa de Corzo I in Chiapas, and the San Lorenzo phase in southern Veracruz[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_MxSanGu]. These societies traded goods and ideas, but would not have been integrated polities.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_MxSanGu]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ ♥</b> Although not necessarily a capital, San José Mogote was the largest site in the valley at this time, and may have been the central site in the Etla arm.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_MxSanGu]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ ♥</b> There are no written records from this phase, but later evidence shows that people in the valley spoke Zapotec, possibly from the succeeding San José Mogote phase, and the Otomanguean language families may have split before the start of this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_MxSanGu]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic Family ♣ Proto-Otomanguean ♥</b> Both the Zapotecan (Zapotec and Chatino) and Mixtecan (Mixtec, Cuicatec and Trique) languages belong to the Otomanguean language family, which also includes: Otopamean, Chinantecan Popolocan, Huave, Amuzgo and Manguean language groups.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_MxSanGu]. These language groups diverged between around 2100 BCE-1400 CE but it is not known exactly when each language or dialect split . It is however likely that Zapotecan and Mixtecan had diverged by 3700 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_MxSanGu]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language Genus ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious Tradition ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Sect ♣ ♥</b>The San José phase (1150-850 BCE), named for a settlement located in the Etla subregion of the Valley of Oaxaca, Southern Mexico, and the Guadalupe phase (850-700 BCE), are combined here because of the difficulty of differentiating between the material culture of the two phases.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_MxSanGu] Both phases were characterized by substantial growth at the settlement of San José Mogote, both in terms of population and the construction of non-residential public buildings.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_MxSanGu] Other sites remained relatively small during this period and were located on more productive land in the low piedmont and alluvial zones.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_MxSanGu][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The degree of social stratification during the San José and Guadalupe phases is a matter of scholarly debate. Archaeologists Joyce Marcus and Kent Flannery identify the emergence of a chiefdom, which would have directed the construction of ceremonial and public spaces.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_MxSanGu] However, Richard Blanton et al.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_MxSanGu] have argued for a more 'corporate form of governance', in which 'members of prominent households' collectively contributed to political decision-making and status distinctions were achieved rather than inherited.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_MxSanGu] While there is no evidence for distinct social classes, burial goods and a range of larger residences suggest that some individuals were more highly ranked within the community than others.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_MxSanGu][MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_MxSanGu] Based on the cranial deformation of some individuals, it has also been argued that there may be evidence for hereditary social rank, although these individuals were not buried with rich goods and so cannot be directly linked with chiefly status within the community. It is possible that although status was mostly determined based on achievements during a person's lifetime, higher status would be more likely for people with a certain parentage.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_MxSanGu] The remains of limestone and travertine building materials from a source 5 kilometres from San José Mogote suggest that the occupants of San José Mogote were beginning to extend their authority to surrounding settlements.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]It has been estimated that there were over 1000 people living at San José Mogote during this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_MxSanGu] The entire valley had an estimated population of around 2000 people divided among 40 communities in the San José phase (1150-850 BCE) and 2000-2500 persons during the Guadalupe phase (850-700 BCE), but these were not integrated into a single polity at this time.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_MxSanGu]</div></body></html>
