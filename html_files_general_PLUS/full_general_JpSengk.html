The Azuchi-Momoyama Period is distinct from the Sengoku because during this latter period central government was reestablished under a number of successive rulers.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]However, the Age of Warring States or Sengoku Period traditionally can extend all the way to the seventeenth century, for example to 1615 CE: "With the final defeat of his rivals at Osaka in 1615, the Tokugawa shoguns took over where the Ashikaga had left off, and the Age of Warring States gave way to the long  Tokugawa Peace, out of which, two and a half centuries later, was born modern Japan."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_JpSengk]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ quasi-polity ♥</b>"It was an age when rival warlords, called daimyo (literally ‘the  great names’) fought one another with armies of samurai - for land, for survival  and, in some cases, even for that seemingly most empty of prizes, the control of the shogun himself and his devastated capital."

The shogun became a prize to control and the capital at Kyoto was devastated by war. The period is also known as the Onin War and the Age of the Warring States (which translated into Japanese becomes the Sengoku jidai or Sengoku Period).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_JpSengk][MAJIDBENAM_BR]There was no central government. The daimyo, supported by their close kinsmen and vassals, often had an inner council to decide on matters of administration and military policy. Military administrators known as bugyo are known to have been employed in a non-fighting capacity.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The dominant territory (kokka) was not defined by the borders of the traditional kuni (province) and was split into fiefs which the daiymo either directly maintained or controlled through a vassal. At times the daimyo made alliances with each other in the quest for more power.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_JpSengk][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Despite the turmoil the population during this period probably increased by five million over 100 years to about 20 million in 1568 CE.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Warring States Japan ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ WarringStatesJapan_1500CE: 1467CE-1568CE ♥</b>  WarringStatesJapan_1500CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_JpSengk]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  287470: 1467CE-1568CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Japonic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Japanesic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Old Japanese ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Shinto ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Japanese State Shinto ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition ♣ Buddhism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religion Family ♣ Japanese Mayahana ♥</b></div></body></html>
