"Sogdiana was not unified, and several Sogdian city-states shared the Zarafshan and adjacent valleys. Samarkand was certainly the principal political power: it occasionally managed to secure control of certain small cities,33 and its king claimed the title of “King of Sogdiana, Sovereign of Samarkand” (sgwdy’nk MLK’ sm’rkndc MR’Y ). Each city had its particular aristocracy, and the cas- tles of the nobles made the Sogdian countryside bristle with many fortified towns around which the population was organized. The nobles drew vast revenues from the land and possessed properties in both town and country." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_UzSogdi]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ alliance; nominal allegiance ♥</b>In response to the Islamic threat Samarkand "managed to form an alliance with some principalities in the Fergana valley".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_UzSogdi][MAJIDBENAM_BR]“These city-states, often at odds with one another, had been under Hephthalite, Türk and Arab rule at varions times." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_UzSogdi][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"In the middle of the seventh century, after the fall of the Western Kaghanate, the Sogdian states gained de facto independence, although formally recognizing the sovereignty of the T’ang dynasty. In the eighth century, this sovereignty proved to be purely nominal, because China gave no real support against the Arab invaders."

"Only in the7thcentury, it seems, was theinternal political structure of the countries of Transoxiana finally constituted - a system of petty independent sovereigns recognizing the paramountcy of a kingwho also has his own territory and is, essentially, a " sovereign ofsovereigns " . In this period we canagain observe comparatively large countries on the political map of the region - Bukharan Sughd, Samarkandian Sughd, Chorasmia, northern Tukharistan, Chach, Farghana - the political cohesion of these countries being apparently of varying extent."

The period ends with the conquest of the region by the Umayyad Dynasty.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_UzSogdi][MAJIDBENAM_BR]A number of City States rose to prominence in the Zarafshan and surrounding valleys,  they formed alliances and competed amongst each other for control of the region .[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_UzSogdi] Chef amongst these City States was Samarkand, which in the seventh century extended across the plateau of Afrasiab.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_UzSogdi][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The height of this period can be considered to have occurred  in mid the 7th century CE when the city of Samarkand was at the peak of its economic and culture production, symbolized by the creation of the Afrasiab paintings. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_UzSogdi][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Although the City States had achieved de facto independence after the fall of the Western Kaghanate, they were nominally allied to the Chinese T’ang dynasty,  however the dynasty did not meaningfully hinder the Arab incursions.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_UzSogdi][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Population and political organization:[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Each city state was ruled by a king, conceived of as ‘first among equals’  who headed the administrative system which ran the state.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_UzSogdi] While there is clear evidence of a strong merchant class their relationship to the ruling elite remains unclear. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_UzSogdi][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Although there are no precise population figures the archaeological evidence indicates that the number of settlements, and thus population, in the region reached its height during this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_UzSogdi]</div></body></html>
