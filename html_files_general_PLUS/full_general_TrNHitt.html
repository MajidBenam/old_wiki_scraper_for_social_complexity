[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_TrNHitt][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The Neo-Hittite period can be divided into two main phases, as suggested by Mazzoni ([1995] 189). The first phase covers the period from the 12th century to the mid 9th century B.C. This period is characterised by the rise of kingdoms each centred on a town. Some of these towns were new foundations, but some were refoundations of earlier urban centres now embellished with monumental iconography. The second period covers the ca. 150 years from the mid 9th century to the Assyrian conquest in the late 8th century B.C. This phase saw the growth of centres and also an increasing concern for security expressed in the building of fortified strongholds throughout the region."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_TrNHitt]  "According to a proposal recently made by I. Yakibovich, the core area of Luwian population was located in central Anatolia, in the region of the Konya Plain, and Luwian migration into western Anatolia occurred only after the Arzawan kingdom had been established." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_TrNHitt]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b>  "the Neo-Hittite kingdoms of the Land of Hatti were essentially an evolution out of the peoples who were already there rather than the result of large waves of new immigrants from devastated homelands in the west. And whether they were of post-Bronze Age or earlier origin, the Luwian-speaking inhabitants of these kingdoms probably constituted only a minority of their populations." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_TrNHitt] "Carchemish and probably Malatya apparently continued from their Late Bronze Age predecessors with little or no interruption."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_TrNHitt]  Tabal region (Konya Plain): "There is nothing in the material record to indicate that it was significantly affected by the upheavals at the end of the Late Bronze Age, or by the collapse of the Hittite empire. Certainly there is no evidence of a shift of peoples from it in this period."

The population of the region was very likely a predominantly Luwian one, as it had been throughout the Late Bronze Age and perhaps already in the early second millennium."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_TrNHitt] "In the post-Bronze Age era, Hittite cuneiform disappeared entirely. There is not the slightest trace of it in any of the Iron Age successor-kingdoms of the Hittites. One might reasonably suppose that along with the disappearance of the written language, Nesite also disappeared as a spoken one."

The primary region of the Syro-Hittite kingdoms was however in Syria. The small states lasted for almost 500 years and were culturally and politically prominent from c900 BCE until the last of them fell to the Assyrian king Sargon II between 717-708 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_TrNHitt] The cultural links between these kingdoms and the Late Bronze Age Hittite Empire can be seen in the iconography and architecture.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_TrNHitt][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the 1180-900 BCE post-Empire period the region reorganized into city-states.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_TrNHitt] The earliest written records suggest there was no kind of federation, "each was entirely independent from the others, each had its own autonomous ruler."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_TrNHitt] The label 'Neo-Hittite' applies to 15 states spread through south-eastern Anatolia and northern Syria.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_TrNHitt] Those present in the area around or on the Konya Plain were the following: Pisidia; Pamphylia; Lycaonia; Tabal; Cilicia (Hilakku and Que).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_TrNHitt][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Although there was some continuity with the preceding period major cultural changes occurred in the Neo-Hittite era. According to Bryce (2012) "Hittite cuneiform disappeared entirely. There is not the slightest trace of it in any of the Iron Age successor-kingdoms of the Hittites. One might reasonably suppose that along with the disappearance of the written language, Nesite also disappeared as a spoken one." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_TrNHitt] Although we do not have any historical records associated with this epoch, historians have speculated that the society of this era used the Hieroglyphic Luwian language.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_TrNHitt] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_TrNHitt] I. Yakibovich has suggested that the core area of Luwian population was located in central Anatolia, in the region of the Konya Plain.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_TrNHitt][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Many Neo-Hittite rulers took the titles "Great King" and "Hero" and it is likely an administrative centre existed in the central town.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_TrNHitt] At the better known Neo-Hittite site of Carchemish, in western Anatolia, a central bureaucracy is known which had scribes, clerks and other officials[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_TrNHitt]; although "Carchemish and probably Malatya apparently continued from their Late Bronze Age predecessors with little or no interruption"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_TrNHitt] which might not be the case for other lesser-known polities of the Neo-Hittite states.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Neo-Hittite Kingdom ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Neo_Hittites_1200BCE: 1180BCE-1101BCE; Neo_Hittites_1100BCE: 1100BCE-1001BCE; Neo_Hittites_1000BCE: 1000BCE-901BCE; Neo_Hittites_900BCE: 900BCE-900BCE ♥</b>  Neo_Hittites_1000BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_TrNHitt] Neo_Hittites_1100BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_TrNHitt] Neo_Hittites_1200BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_TrNHitt] Neo_Hittites_900BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_TrNHitt]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  263653: 1180BCE-1101BCE;  148845: 1100BCE-1001BCE;  148631: 1000BCE-901BCE;  148631: 900BCE-900BCE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Luvic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Luwian ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Ancient Anatolian Religion ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Hittite Religion ♥</b></div></body></html>
