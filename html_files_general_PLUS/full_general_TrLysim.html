However: “Some poleis were accorded internal autonomy and the right to form alliances, but under the supervision of a strategos of the King as attested by the Ionian League. Similar organizations may to some extent even have the freedom to follow a foreign policy of their own.”[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_TrLysim]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ vassalage; personal union; alliance ♥</b>   323 BCE: vassalage; 323-281 BCE: personal union; alliance; 281 BCE: vassalage   The Thracian territory was part of Alexander's empire until his death in 323 BCE. Thrace was then ruled by Lysimachus (and Seuthes?). The two rulers seem to have come to an arrangement with each other, but the exact nature of this relationship is unclear. Lysimachus created personal unions with other ruling families through marriage, and allied Thrace with other Diadoch polities at various times. The Thracian territory was once again taken over by an expanding empire in 281 BCE when Lysimachus was defeated by Seleucus of the Seleucid Empire.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_TrLysim][MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_TrLysim]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Macedonian Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Seleucid Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ Greek ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Lysimacheia ♥</b>  Lysimacheia: 309-281 BCE   [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_TrLysim][MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_TrLysim]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Greek ♥</b> Lysimachus was Macedonian.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Genus ♣ Hellenistic Religions ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Genus ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion ♣ ♥</b>The map shows the kingdoms of Alexander's Successors (or Diadochs) around 300 BCE. Lysimachus had extended his kingdom of Thrace to include areas in Asia Minor.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Thracian kingdom under Lysimachus constituted only a short period in the history of the area. The Odrysian Kingdom was present in Thrace before it was conquered by Philip II, then ruled by Alexander the Great until his death in 323 BCE. Lysimachus, one of Alexander’s Successors, took over governorship of the area and eventually declared himself king in 306 BCE. Lysimachus ruled with an expansionist policy, and extended the kingdom to its furthest reaches by around 300 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_TrLysim] His reign was however, very short lived. He was defeated at the Battle of Corupedium by Seleucus (ruler of the Seleucid Empire) in 281 BCE and his territories became part of the Seleucid Empire.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The evidence of Lysimachus’ reign is very limited and, “There is almost no direct information as to Lysimachus’ administration, nor do we know the site of his headquarters before Lysimacheia’s walls rose in 309 BCE.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_TrLysim] There is however a certain amount of continuity with the Odrysian Kingdom before the Macedonain conquest which may provide some proxy information on Thrace under Lysimachus. In addition, there is some evidence that Thracian rulers continued to rule under or with Lysimachus, although the exact nature of their relationship is not clear. The earlier reigns of Philip II and Alexander, and the subsequent reign of Seleucus, have not been coded on this page as those polities have separate pages. It was only under Lysimachus that the area was ruled relatively independently, and only during this time that the boundaries were extended to include the Konya Plain.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Lysimachus Kingdom ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Lysimachus_300BCE: 323BCE-281BCE ♥</b>  Lysimachus_300BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_TrLysim]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  537834: 323BCE-281BCE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Graeco-Phrygian ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Greek ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Ancient Mediterranean Religion ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Ancient Mediterranean Paganism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Sect ♣ Ancient Graeco-Phrygian Paganism ♥</b></div></body></html>
