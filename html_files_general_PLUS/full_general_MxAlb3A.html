Neither conquered the other (based on distinct material culture and architectural styles) but did trade with one another.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_MxAlb3A] Evidence for this includes the Lapida de Bazan (a carved stone slab at Monte Alban) which depicts a peaceful meeting between a Teotihuacan ambassador and Zapotec lord.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_MxAlb3A] In addition, there is evidence for a "Oaxaca barrio" at Teotihuacan, with pottery styles dating to the MA II-III phases.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_MxAlb3A] Political and ritual (as well as commercial) relationships were also probably maintained between the Zapotec state and former territories, such as the Sola Valley.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_MxAlb3A]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ MxAlb2* ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b> The centre at Monte Albán continued to grow during this period, but the territorial extent of the Zapotec state outside of the Valley of Oaxaca declined.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_MxAlb3A]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ MxAlb3B ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ Zapotec ♥</b> The valley became much more integrated during this period, with a consistent “Zapotec ceramic tradition”, Monte Albán stone monument styles and a wider distribution of settlements in the piedmont zone away from Monte Albán.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_MxAlb3A]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Monte Albán ♥</b> Monte Albán continued to grow during this period, and reached peaked in population size and settled area.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_MxAlb3A]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Zapotec ♥</b> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_MxAlb3A]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic Family ♣ Otomanguean ♥</b> Both the Zapotecan (Zapotec and Chatino) and Mixtecan (Mixtec, Cuicatec and Trique) languages belong to the Otomanguean language family, which also includes: Otopamean, Chinantecan Popolocan, Huave, Amuzgo and Manguean language groups.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_MxAlb3A]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language Genus ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious Tradition ♣ Monte Albán Religion ♥</b> Monte Albán Religion. Besides royal ancestors, 39 gods have been identified, most of them identified with natural elements or entities (e.g. maize). Other natural elements or entities include saurian, snakes, jaguars.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_MxAlb3A].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Sect ♣ ♥</b>The Monte Albán IIIA phase (200-500 CE) is generally regarded as the 'golden age' or Classic period of the Zapotec state,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_MxAlb3A] due to the widespread uniformity of ceramics and monumental construction as well as increased economic and political integration, centred at Monte Albán.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_MxAlb3A][MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_MxAlb3A] The population of the capital, Monte Albán, continued to grow and the construction of monumental buildings at the site reached its peak. These buildings dominate what can be seen at the ruins of Monte Albán today.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_MxAlb3A][MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_MxAlb3A] Additional settlements were established in the piedmont area (including Jalieza with 13,000 inhabitants in the southern sub-valley and Dainzú-Macuilxochitl-Tlacochahuaya-Guadalupe [DMTG] with 12,000 inhabitants in the eastern sub-valley).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_MxAlb3A][MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_MxAlb3A] The movement of people into the piedmont areas may imply an increase in demand for agricultural labour during this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_MxAlb3A] The territorial extent of the Zapotec state, on the other hand, decreased during this period in the face of increasingly powerful competitors on the borders of the state. Previously subordinate areas, such as the Sola Valley, became independent of the Zapotec state.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_MxAlb3A][MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_MxAlb3A][MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_MxAlb3A][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Five named rulers are known for this 400-year period, identified in public monuments in the vicinity of the Main Plaza of Monte Albán.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_MxAlb3A] Status appears to have been inherited and related to one's proximity to apical ancestors.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_MxAlb3A] Burial remains and the differences in construction of residential buildings suggest two class-endogamous strata during this period, with the majority of the population (an estimated 96-98 percent) belonging to the commoner class.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_MxAlb3A] The Zapotecs focused on internal consolidation: an increasing proportion of settlements were in defensible locations or had fortifications, and there was agricultural intensification in the piedmont and high alluvium zones.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_MxAlb3A] There was also a pattern of settlement clustering around the main centres, similar to the pattern shown in the Monte Albán Late I phase (300-100 BCE), except the clustering occurred around secondary centres as well as around the primary centre, Monte Albán.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_MxAlb3A][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Archaeologists Joyce Marcus and Kent Flannery estimate the population of the valley to have been around 115,000 people during this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_MxAlb3A] A population range of 15,000-30,000 for Monte Albán is based on the estimated number of people living in each of the households at the site. Larger households may have included 10-20 people, while 5-10 may have lived in the smaller households, although this may be an underestimate.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_MxAlb3A]</div></body></html>
