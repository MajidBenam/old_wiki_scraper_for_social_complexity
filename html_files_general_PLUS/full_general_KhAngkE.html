In doing so, Jayavarman confirmed himself as the great unifier; drawing Cambodia’s disparate polities together under the first ‘god king’ and establishing the Khmer state and the basis of its empire. Phnom Kulen was known as Mahendraparvata; ‘‘the hill of the great Indra’’. The extant history of Mahendraparvata is based on several inscriptions, the most well-known being an 11th century CE inscription (K.235) found at the Sdok Kak Thom temple, in eastern Thailand [4]. The inscription, dated to 1052 CE, outlines the lineage of a private family serving successive Khmer Kings for two and a half centuries, the first mentioned being Jayavarman II.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_KhAngkE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]• 'Shadowy as he appears through retrospective inscriptions, Jayavarman II still occupies a central position in the history of Angkor, becauase he was regarded for centuries after his death as he who founded the state, in a traditional date of 802 AD.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_KhAngkE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]• The end of the Angkor in approximately 1432 CE with the Siamese 'invasion' or 'sacking' of Angkor. "Scholars usually place the Angkorean period of Cambodian history between 802 and 1431.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_KhAngkE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]• 'There was a watershed, dated to the year 802, whereby a series of competing polities were joined into one enduring and powerful central state. This transition involved a process of contralization instituted by the overlord Jayavarman II (ruled 802 to 834). Jayavarman seems to have identified a means of unifying formerly competing overlords that was rooted first in military conquest, then by placing his followers in positions of authority. This had the effect of establishing a central rule through replacing independent polities by provinces. He also must have appreciated the importance of stressing the mystical properties of kingship by instituting the cult of the kamraten jagat ta raja, meaning "the god who is king." Deification of the ruler, linked with vesting the rights to consecrate a new god-king in successive members of a given family, meant that the succession should be assured. Remarkably, the ensuing five centuries witnessed a considerable degree of legitimacy in the succession, being largely confined to members of the aristocratic lineage of Aninditapura.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_KhAngkE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]• 'Traditionally, the Angkorian period is said to have begun in 802, the year that Jayavarman II (r. 802-834) was crowned king. In a ritual evoking the mythology of  ̋iva and celebrated in the Phnom Kulen (Kulen Mountains), north of Angkor, he became the cakravartin/cakkavatti (universal monarch) of the new kingdom.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_KhAngkE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]• 'The elephant was most clearly recorded during the Khmer empire dating from roughly 809 C.E. to 1431 C.E. During this time, the great temple of Angkor Wat and the Bayon were built.The frequent wars against theThais and Chams involved use of large “tuskers,” or superior male elephants, as well as elephants that carried men and goods. Elephants were important in moving the stones that built the temples, the logs that built the palaces, and the rice and other foods produced by the popu- lace to feed the royalty and the priests.The war elephants are wonderfully illustrated in the reliefs on the gallery walls of Angkor Wat. Similarly, many elephants are found among the carvings on the walls of Borobudur, the great Javanese Hindu-Buddhist temple dating to about 800 C.E.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_KhAngkE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]• 'In the history of Cambodia, the year 802 symbolizes the beginning of the Angkor era because the Sdok Kak Thom inscription specifies that Jayavarman II conducted a ceremony to free Cambodia from Java in that year.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_KhAngkE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]• 'Cambodian history is normally divided into the pre-Angkor (third century to 802 CE), Angkor (802-1432), and post-Angkor periods. The pre-Angkor period is mainly known from seventh-century inscriptions; Angkor epigraphy begins in the late ninth century. Thus there is a crucial gap in our sources during the critical transitional phase.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_KhAngkE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]• 'The founder of Angkor, King Jayavarman II, is a shadowy figure and we still have no entirely satisfactory explanation as to why he moved his capital from the Mekong Valley to the drier region at the north-west tip of the Great Lake. He left no inscriptions that we know of. We know that he established his court in the region in 802 AD and that he reigned for almost 50 years before his death at Roluos, south-east of the main complex at Angkor.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_KhAngkE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ unitary state ♥</b>• 'All the institutions of government reviewed above give the impression that they belong to an apparatus of (as least potentially) oppressive, even totalitarian, power. Indeed, it is altogether likely that after the time of Rajendravarman the kings of Angkor presided over a much more centralized regime than the Khmers had known before. Institutions of government embodied no principles of constitutional checks upon royal power beyond the notion of religious morality. An impulse to totalitarian government was present, and found expression whenever rulers found themselves temporarily without dangerous rivals still at large. We must remember, though, that this tate lacked all the advantages of modern communications and technology to assert its control in detail, and that all sorts of regional, personal and factional loyalties were liable to obstruct the impulse to totalitarianism before too long.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_KhAngkE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]• 'Angkor under Suyavarman [II] was at the peak of its glory. The institutional reforms of Rajendravarman were secure, giving a measure of centralisation to the administration of the empire.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_KhAngkE]&nbsp;:•&nbsp;:• 'The central administration in Angkor must have had fairly detailed information for the purposes of taxation and core labour of all the empire's inhabitants, for according to Zhou a census was taken during the ninth Cambodian month, where everyone (or, more likely, all heads of families) was called to the capital, and passed in review before the Royal Palace. Such census registers were kept in Aymonier's day, and revised every three years.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_KhAngkE] 'Because the Angkor kingdom commanded a significant army and a large centralized administrative apparatus and because thousands of workers were needed to build and maintain its enormous building complexes, it has been assumed that around the stone constructions of the palaces and temples a city with a substantial population must have existed.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_KhAngkE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]• 'Jayavarman II appears to have brought significant land and regional lords into a ‘single’ domain by 802 CE. We can begin to discern a ‘united’ polity, and a series of single or at least preeminent capitals: Hariharālaya (Roluos); Yaśodharapura (Angkor); Koh Ker.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_KhAngkE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]• 'All such leaders were tied to the overlord by webs of family, mar- riage, and patronage whose instability ensured constant fluctuations in the center’s territorial influence. Reliable royal control in the sense of resource exaction was therefore confined to the capital zone, which nor- mally included the empire’s most populous districts but which might not exceed a 60-mile radius. In Pagan, Angkor, and to a lesser extent perhaps early Champa and Dai Viet, temples and monasteries served simultaneously as agencies of agricultural reclamation, ritual validation, and intra-elite alliance. Because these wealthy, self-regulating religious institutions helped to stabilize labor and to concentrate resources, they tended to compress and, in some ways, to obviate royal administration. Nonetheless, the ruler remained indispensable as ritual intermediary between kingdom and cosmos, as military leader, and as coordinator of temple as well as secular patronage. Thus, while accepting that these were weak forms of the genus, we can still recognize charter-era entities as “states” according to Charles Tilly’s minimalist definition: “coercion- wielding organizations that are distinct from households and kinship groups and exercise clear priority in some respects over all other orga- nizations within substantial territories.”45'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_KhAngkE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥</b>• Although Sūryavarman I formed alliances with Champa and China against Annam as did other leaders, these alliances were not long-standing or enshrined by inter-marriage. While tribute was at times paid to China, this too was not consistent or indicative of a subordinate relationship.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]• 'George Coedes connected the Khmer request for aid to the internal politics of the Angkorian empire. In doing so, he noted the statement of the PrdsdtBen inscription, that Jayaviravarman's"universal glory was not destroyed by the times. Although beaten, he remainedstableon the earth ..." 67). Elaborating on this statement, Coedes suggested that the gift of the "king of Kambaja"in the Puttur plates correspondedin time to a Khmer military campaign into the Chao Phrayariver valley and was SuiryavarmanI's request for aid against his rival Jayaviravarmanand Tambralinga. Faced with a possible [...] alliance,Tambralinga turned for aid to Srivijaya. In Coedes'view, the result of this complicated diplomacy was the raid,which, as expressed in the famous Tanjore inscription of o030 was directed at Srivijaya and its ports-one of which was Tambralinga (Midimalifigam)68). Completing his argument, Coedes stated that the Ch6la expedition led to the reintroduction of Khmer influence in the isthmian region during the second quarter of the century.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_KhAngkE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Chenla ♥</b> {Chenla- Water; Chenla- Land}</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b> 'The establishment of a grand and long-lasting civilization centred on the northern shore of the Tonle Sap does not represent a major dislocation with the preceding Chenla statelets, nor indeed with the preceding prehistoric period, for Iron Age burials and occupation have been identified under the early Hindu temple of Prei Khmeng, just west of Angkor, and next to the southern entrance to the city of Angkor Thom.

Thereafter until the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries, the locations of administrative centers and palaces moved around within the network of the urban complex. Only in the late twelfth century, with the construction of the walled and moated central enclosure of Angkor Thom, did the practice of relocating the administrative centre cease. Thereafter, the Bayon, the central temple of Angkor Thom, also became the permanent state temple and Angkor'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_KhAngkE] 'We know little of the history of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and the Khmer chronicles are primarily eighteenth- and nineteenth-century court documents created in the eastern Khmer capitals, in particular Phnom Phenh, with a specific political agenda in mind.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_KhAngkE] 'Angkor was the vast low-density capital of the Khmer Kingdom, from the early 9th to the mid-14th/15th centuries of the Common Era (CE). At its peak, Angkor sprawled over nearly 1000 km2 [1] and may have housed more than three quarters of a million people [2,3]. The primary administrative centre in a kingdom that dominated most of mainland Southeast Asia by the 11th century CE, Angkor was the largest preindustrial city on Earth and remains the world’s largest archaeological site. The Angkor period is commonly understood to start in 802 CE with the proclamation of Jayavarman II as the chakravartin (universal-king) from a location in the Kulen mountains (Phnom Kulen), overlooking the vast alluvial plain where Angkor would begin to emerge in the following centuries (Figure 1).

The baray is now dry. It apparently ceased to function in the 10th century, perhaps influencing the decision of Jayavarman IV (921-941) to move to Koh Ker. When the capital was moved from Koh Ker back to Angkor, the East Baray was altered by moving the south bank farther south and raising its height from 2 meters (6.5 feet) to 5 meters (16.5 feet).
