The previous settlement pattern of nucleated clusters of houses "was abandoned in favor of widely scattered single-family farmsteads"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_USCahoE] between which were structures "with special ritual and social significance."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_USCahoE] Whilst most Cahokians were self-sufficient granaries were also present.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_USCahoE] There were likely at least 50,000 people supported within the the 2000 Km2 region of 'greater Cahokia'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_USCahoE] of which about 15,000 lived in an area called the 'central administrative complex'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_USCahoE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Many archaeologists are skeptical whether there was a ruler king at Cahokia[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_USCahoE]  the polity more likely led by a "a priesthood or a group of ruler-priests"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_USCahoE] within a social strata that included included chiefs, sub-chiefs, elders, priests, and other religious functionaries."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_USCahoE] The Cahokians were capable of feats of organization that included the famous Monks Mound and other mounds which required moving 1.1 million m3 or earth and a 15m high wooden palisade that ran for nearly 3km.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_USCahoE]</div></body></html>
