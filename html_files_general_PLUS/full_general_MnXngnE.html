Here, we are interested in the phase of its prehistory in the millennium preceding the establishment of the Xiongnu empire, that is, 1400-300 BCE. Unfortunately, very little is known about this period,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_MnXngnE] though Chinese historians note that at the very end of this period the Xiongnu were one of three major steppe confederations in Mongolia more widely.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_MnXngnE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]No population estimates could be found specifically for the an average independent political unit in the Orkhon Valley at this time, though it is worth noting that, according to McEvedy and Jones (1978), the total population of Siberia and Mongolia in this period did not exceed 400,000.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_MnXngnE] Similarly, no information could be found on political organization at this time.</div></body></html>
