Sima Yan overthrew Cao Wei emperor Cao Huan in 265 CE and declared himself the Western Jin emperor.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_CnErJin] In its 280 CE conquest of Eastern Wu, Western Jin dynasty ended the Three Kingdoms period and reunified China.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_CnErJin] However, the central government was in almost constant turmoil because of internal conflict and corruption.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_CnErJin] A series of rebellions of princes against imperial authority known as the Revolts of the Imperial Princes (291-306 CE) weakened the central government and led to the Disorder of the Five Tribes (304-316 CE), a large uprising of northern nomadic tribes.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_CnErJin] In 316 CE, an imperial Jin prince fled south when a Xiongnu chief attacked the Western Jin capital of Luoyang. The prince went on to found the Eastern Jin dynasty in present day Nanjing.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_CnErJin] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_CnErJin][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The territory of the Western Jin empire was close to the size of the Han empire.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_CnErJin] We have estimated that Western Jin polity territory covered 4.5 million square kilometers in 300 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Despite the political turmoil of the period, advancements made in agriculture, craftsmanship, architecture, medicine, astronomy, and mathematics.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_CnErJin] Buddhism continued to spread throughout China, and Daoism was revived and seen as a more well-defined religion.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_CnErJin] There were many writers, poets and artists from the time of the Jin and the period is often seen as the first period for traditional Chinese art.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_CnErJin][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Western Jin maintained many administrative structures of the Han. The empire was divided into provinces and semi-autonomous kingdoms.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_CnErJin] However the Western Jin operated as a neo-feudal society.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_CnErJin] Military rulers governed with the support of relatives, and Confucian values gradually disappeared from the central government and the education system.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_CnErJin] The weak central government struggled to control the non-Chinese tribes living in the empire.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_CnErJin][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The population of the Western Jin empire was recorded as 16.16 million in a 280 CE census.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_CnErJin]The population of Luoyang was 600,000 people in 300 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_CnErJin]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Western Jin Dynasty ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ WesternJin_300CE: 265CE-317CE ♥</b>  WesternJin_300CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_CnErJin]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  3573260: 265CE-317CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Sino-Tibetan ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Sinitic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Old Chinese ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Confucianism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Imperial Confucianism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition ♣ Buddhism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religion Family ♣ Chinese Buddhism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition2 ♣ Daoism ♥</b></div></body></html>
