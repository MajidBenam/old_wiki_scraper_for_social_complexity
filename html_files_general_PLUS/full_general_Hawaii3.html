'Umi did not fill a merely ceremonial role, as the previous chiefs had, but controlled the use of land, instituted a system of territorial administration and ahupua'a land parcels, intensified food production, specialized labour, and elaborated the religious system.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_Hawaii3] I think we can consider this a unitary state. 'According to Kamakau, 'Umi divided his kingdom' between two of his sons, Keli'iokaloa-a-'Umi and Keawenui-a-'Umi, thus splitting the island, but Keli'iokaloa defeated his brother in battle and 'became the king of a once again unified island'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_Hawaii3] After the death of King Lonoikamakahiki c. 1630 'follows [a] phase of political fragmentation, when the leeward and windward regions came under the control of the Mahi and 'Ī lineages of Kohala and Hilo, respectively'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_Hawaii3] Nominally, Keakealanikane became king of the island, but 'his reign was either ineffectual or simply not recognized by the district chiefs'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_Hawaii3] After the death of Keakealaniwahine around 1690, her son Keawe-'ikekahi-ali'i-o-ka-moku 'established some degree of unity over the island, even though the district chiefs retained considerable power':[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_Hawaii3] this sounds like 'loose' control. After Keawe-'ikekahi-ali'i-o-ka-moku's death, 'A strong and powerful kingship reasserted itself again ... with Alapa'inui' c. 1710.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_Hawaii3] Around 1752 CE, a warrior chief with a claim to the throne, Kalani'ōpu'u, rose up against Alapa'inui and 'gained control of his natal districts of Ka'ū and Puna, while Alapa'inui ruled the rest of the island', so the Big Island became a quasi-polity once again.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_Hawaii3] After Alapa'inui's death, Kalani'ōpu'u managed to defeat Alapa'inui's son Keawe'ōpala and gain control of the whole island - this must have happened around 1755 as Kirch tells us that Keawe'ōpala's reign began c. 1754 but 'was short'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_Hawaii3] Kalani'ōpu'u 'devoted considerable attention to administration' and held onto power long enough to greet Captain James Cook off the windward coast of Maui in 1778.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_Hawaii3] (Dates are approximate here due to the oral-historical nature of the sources.

Our 'Hawaii 3' refers to the period from 1580 to 1778 CE. 1580 is the approximate date of the formation of the first island-wide unitary kingdom, while 1778 is the date of first European contact ‒ the arrival of Captain Cook.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_Hawaii3][MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_Hawaii3][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]By about 1580, 'Umi had become the first true 'king' (<i>ali'i nui</i>) of the entire Big Island.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_Hawaii3] In contrast with the chiefs who came before him, he is said to have exerted greater control over land tenure, instituted a system of territorial administration based on <i>ahupua'a</i> land parcels, intensified food production, and elaborated the religious system.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_Hawaii3][MAJIDBENAM_BR]After 'Umi, the island alternated several times between being split into two or more smaller polities, and being united under one ruler.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_Hawaii3] In times of greater integration, the kingdom was divided into districts (<i>moku</i>) which were each under the control of a major chief called an <i>ali'i-'ai-moku</i>.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_Hawaii3] Within districts were territories called <i>ahupua'a</i>, ruled by chiefs called <i>ali'i-'ai-ahupua'a</i>. The more powerful of these <i>ali'i</i> held more than one ahupua'a.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_Hawaii3] Below the ahupua'a chiefs, <i>konohiki</i> land managers (often their junior relatives) oversaw the collection of tribute from the commoner farmers, known as <i>maka'āinana</i>.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_Hawaii3][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Overall, this period was characterized by a high-density but stable population settled in all ecological zones, a secondary intensification of the dryland field systems, and endemic conquest warfare.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_Hawaii3] The population of the entire Hawaiian archipelago by Cook's arrival was certainly very large, but there is a long-standing debate regarding exact numbers. Estimates range between 250,000 and 800,000.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_Hawaii3]</div></body></html>
