As Derrett notes, Vinayadithya was obliged to acknowledge Chalukya supremacy by 1078  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_InHoysa]. But it was only during the rule of Vishnuvardhana (r. 1108-1152) that Hoysala rose to the dignity of a kingdom[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_InHoysa]. The Hoysala rule came to an end in 1346, as the last ruler Vira Virupaksha died [MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_InHoysa].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]It was under Ballala II that Bellary once again capitulated to Hoysala KIngdom (had been under VIsnuvardhana some 70 years before) in or around 1192 [MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_InHoysa].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]It seems that Vishnuvardhana entered the town of Bellare (the modern Bellary) in 1118, or some time between 1118-20 [MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_InHoysa].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ unitary state ♥</b> Accordin to Derrett, there were feudatories of the Hoysala Kingdom in 1142, but the Hoysala kingdom itself was a subordinate of the Calukyas  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_InHoysa]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ nominal allegiance; none ♥</b> nominal allegiance: 1078-1191CE; none: 1191-1310CE; allegiance: 1310-1346CE As Derrett notes, Vinayadithya was obliged to acknowledge Chalukya supremacy by 1078 and became a feudatory [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_InHoysa]. While Vishnuvardhana's (r. 1108-1152) incessant attempts to overthrow the yoke of Chalukya suzerainty proved a failure, he raised his territory to the dignity of a kingdom[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_InHoysa]. Ballala's time (r.1173-1120) saw the achievement of independence from Chalukyas[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_InHoysa] as their rule fell in 1191 [MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_InHoysa]. In 1310, the Hoysala ruler submitted to the Delhi Sultan's army, and the following decades were a struggle of resistance against the Delhi Sultans and the allegiance they had forced on Hoysala [MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_InHoysa][MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_InHoysa].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Chalukyas of Kalyani ♥</b> Western Chalukya Empire[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_InHoysa].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b> feudal subordinate The Hoysalas began their rule as the feudatories of the Chalukyas and when their power was on the wane, the Hoysalas asserted their independence and established their supremacy over Karnataka as it stands today[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_InHoysa].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Vijayanagara Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Sosavur; Dvarasamudram; Kannanur ♥</b> Originally, the Hoysalas had their capital at Sosavur or the Sanskrit Shashakapura, and later it was transferred to Halebid or Dorasamudra [MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_InHoysa]. Dvarasamudram (or Dorasamudra) was the capital until the late fourteenth century, established in the hill-bounded area of modern Halebid in Hassan district by an eleventh-century Hoysala chief. Dvarasamudram was over 35 miles from the major area of agricultural production and settlement of the kingdom, on the Hemavati River, and 42 miles north of the Kaveri, which formed the boundary with Gangavadi and its ancient Ganga kings to the south [MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_InHoysa].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Ramanatha was expulsed from Kannanur - the loss of that capital city naturally increased Ramanatha’s interes in the plateau. From 1281 his administration on the plateau expanded, and almost certainly in the tear 1283-84, the seat of government was removed to a place called Kunadni. This was the new capital from which Ramanatha chose to survey the collapse of his riparian kingdom [MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_InHoysa].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The later Hoysala capital Kannanur was established where the Kaveri delta began, between the centres of Chola and Pandya power in the south. Established in the uplands over the gateway to the Kaveri delta, the capital resembled the capitals of other masters of river valleys more than it did Dvarasamudram and thus reflected the now divided character of the Hoysala kingdom[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_InHoysa].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Kannada; Sanskrit ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Dravidian; Indo-European ♥</b> Kannada is a Dravidian language[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_InHoysa], and Sanskrit is an Indo-European language[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_InHoysa].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Hoysala dynasty ruled over a territory roughly equivalent to the southern Indian state of Karnataka, plus the eastern and southeastern margins of Andhra Pradesh and the northwest corner of Tamil Nadu.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_InHoysa] For much of the 12th century CE, the Hoysalas were mere provincial rulers within the wider Chalukya empire,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_InHoysa] but they rebelled and wrested control over the region from the Chalukyas in 1191.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_InHoysa] They lost their empire with the death of Emperor Vira Virupaksha in 1346.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_InHoysa] Under Hoysala rule, literature and the arts flourished, particularly architecture, as testified by the Hoysala temples at Halebidu, Belur and Somanathapura.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_InHoysa][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]As with most preceding South Indian polities, the Hoysala ruler held judiciary, executive and legislative powers[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_InHoysa] and was also the polity's supreme military leader.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_InHoysa] He was assisted at court by several ministers[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_InHoysa] and in the provinces by governors.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_InHoysa][MAJIDBENAM_BR]No population estimates for this period could be found in the literature.</div></body></html>
