Here we extend it to include the transitional century or so between the Early and the Mature Harappan. This period was characterized by the spread of farming communities across the Indus Basin, reaching as far as the Upper Ganga-Yamuna Doab in modern-day North India. Overall, this was not a period of great innovation, but precursors of writing appear to have emerged at this time, and, together with the appearance of seals and weights, these point to a shift in organizational complexity.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_PkPreUr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]No population estimates could be found in the literature. There is also no clear picture of political organization at this time - seals have been found in relevant archaeological contexts, but the existence of a bureaucratic apparatus remains unlikely.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_PkPreUr]</div></body></html>
