In the fourteenth century, the latter faced a precarious geopolitical position, courting friendship with the Mongols as a counterbalance of the more immediate threat presented by the Delhi Sultanate. After that, the Samma were able to rule over Sind somewhat uneventfully, until 1520, when Shah Begh Argun, followed swiftly by Babur, founder of Mughal dynasty, conquered the region. The Arguns continued to govern Sind up until 1591, when it was fully integrated into the Mughal empire.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_PkSind2][MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_PkSind2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Panwhar believes that the population of Sind at this time is unlikely to have exceeded one million[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_PkSind2], though Lakho provides an estimate of 2,200,000.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_PkSind2] As for political organization, the polity was ruled by a jam, who delegated power over regions and districts to specially appointed governors, who were closely related to the emir himself.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_PkSind2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Sindh ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Sindh_1400CE: 1335CE-1499CE; Sindh_1500CE: 1500CE-1521CE ♥</b>  Sindh_1400CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_PkSind2] Sindh_1500CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_PkSind2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  210792: 1335CE-1499CE;  189093: 1500CE-1521CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Indo-Iranian ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Sanskrit ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Islam ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Sunni Islam: 1400CE; Shia Islam: 1500CE ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Sect ♣ Ismalii: 1500CE ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition ♣ Islam: 1500CE ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religion Family ♣ Sunni Islam: 1500CE ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition2 ♣ Buddhism ♥</b></div></body></html>
