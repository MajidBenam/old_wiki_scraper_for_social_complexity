Here, we are interested in the phase of its prehistory known as the Late Postclassic period, when the Aztecs or Mexica rose to power (c. 1427-1526 CE). The Aztec Empire was born from the "Triple Alliance" between the city-states (altepetl) of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan, who agreed to collaborate on campaign of territorial expansion and share the resulting tribute and tax payments.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_MxAztec] Within a century, the three cities came to control a significant portion of Northern Mesoamerica, the main exception being the West, which, despite some military successes on the part of the Triple Alliance early on, largely remained under the control of the Tarascans.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_MxAztec][MAJIDBENAM_BR]As the empire grew, so did the power of Tenochtitlan, which became the de-facto administrative capital, whose ruler came to hold the title huey tlatoani (“high king”). Tenochtitlan's power was strongest over the empire's central provinces, where the Aztecs ruled through governors, judges, tax collectors and other officials that they appointed themselves. For the "outer" provinces, the Aztecs limited themselves to targeting major centres, where, again, they appointed their governors and administrative officials. Finally, the Aztecs secured their power over "frontier" provinces by guaranteeing military protection from external foes, in exchange for "gifts" of soldiers and prestige goods.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_MxAztec][MAJIDBENAM_BR]By the time of Spanish conquest in the 1520s, Tenochtitlan likely housed between 150,000 and 250,000 people,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_MxAztec] perhaps even 3,000.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_MxAztec]</div></body></html>
