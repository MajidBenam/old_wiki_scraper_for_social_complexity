Before his ascension to the throne, Babylon was one of several petty states of fluctuating importance. By the end of his reign he had gained control of most of Babylonia, taken the old title of King of Sumer and Akkad, and had, for a brief time, taken over Assyria. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_IqBabAm]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 2000 - 1600 BCE ♥</b>2000 BCE - Ur, of the Ur III period, fell to the Elamites in 2004 BCE. The Amorites are thought to have gradually filled the power gap left in Mesopotamian society. They became kings of city-states, establishing an Amorite elite that would become a Babylonian dynasty.  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_IqBabAm][MAJIDBENAM_BR]1600 BCE - At this time the Old Babylonian Dynasty came to end due to an invasion by the Hittites. The Hittites had established a rapidly expanding kingdom in Asia Minor and the king, Murshili I, conquered north-west Syria, then the land around the Euphrates until he reached Babylon. The city was quickly taken, but Murshili I returned to the Hittite capital due to political troubles where he was rapidly assasinated. The Kassite rulers consequently came to power in Babylonia.

Kings of smaller city-states would pledge their allegiance to one of the bigger city-states thus creating petty states. The allegiance of the small city-states was constantly fluctuating, thus the size and influence of the petty states were also never constant. Babylon had the allegiance of a number of city states put each still had a king and Babylon's influence was minimal. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_IqBabAm][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Once Hammurabi started his military campaigns, he began exerting military power over former allies, such as Zimri-Lin, then further afield in Southern Mesopotamia. He soon claimed the title 'King of Sumer and Akkad' and later had control of cities such as Assur and Nineveh, thus becoming king of Assyria. While major administrative changes occurred, many of the governing bodies of the cities remained and a significant degree of decision making remained in the former city-states.

They migrated towards Mesopotamia and Amorite names can be seen in Mesopotamian literature throughout the 3rd millennium BCE. By the 2nd millennium BCE a number of Amorites had managed to gain control of Mesopotamian city-states in the power vacuum created by the collapse of the Ur III period. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_IqBabAm] Very early descriptions suggest they were nomadic, eating raw meat and "careless even of burying their dead", but at least part of the population settled into a sedentary lifestyle and took up the western Semetic language of Akkadian. The city and kingdom of Mari was an Amorite establishment. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_IqBabAm][MAJIDBENAM_BR]One problem encountered when considering the Amorites as a polity is that they are frequently identified by their Amorite name, but it cannot be certain whether this corresponds to an individual who is actually an Amorite or if Amorite names are in general use. For example, the Isin-Larsa period is considered a separate polity from the Old Babylonian, Amorite Dynasty, yet the kings of both cities used Amorite names and titles. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_IqBabAm][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Babylonian king Sumu-la-el started to assert control over other towns in northern Babylonia and in the first few centuries of the 2nd Millennium Babylon became one of several city-states with a limited and fluctuating control over surrounding areas. This was the situation when Hammurabi came to the throne in 1792. By the end of his reign, he had conquered the whole of Babylon and briefly Assyria. He titled himself "King of the Four Quarters of the World" and "King of Sumer and Akkad" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_IqBabAm]</div></body></html>
