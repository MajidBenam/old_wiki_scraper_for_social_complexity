The first assumes that empires and centralization happen together, and is based on an uncritical reading of the main source for the period, the Arthashastra. The source is from the perspective of elites in the imperial centre, and may be overstating the efficiency of the state. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_InMaury]. The work of Gerard Fussman instead presents an argument that the empire could not have been centralized based on both the size and the technology of communication avaliable at the time. This argument is further bolstered by the presence of non-literal translations of edicts in local administrative languages. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_InMaury] As with most questions of this nature, the empire was in parts centralized, and part autonomous. It was a large metropolitan state with an outward looking elite overseeing with varying degrees of success over a large and in no way homogeneous collection of functionaries at both the provincial, district and village level connected together through a central vision originating with the King.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Nanda Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Shunga Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ Hinduism ♥</b> Note on Asoka's Buddhism: "the distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism in India was purely sectarian and never more than the difference between saivism and vaishnavism. The exclusiveness of religious doctrines is a Semitic conception, which was unknown to India for a long time. Buddha himself was looked upon in his lifetime and afterwards as a Hindu saint and avatar and his followers were but another sect in the great Aryan tradition. Ashoka was a Buddhist in the same way as Harsha was a Budhist, or Kumarapala was a Jain. But in the view of the people of the day he was a Hindu monarch following one of the recognized sects. His own inscriptions bear ample withness to the fact. While his doctrines follow the middle path, his gifts are to the brahmibns, sramansa (Buddhist priests) and others equally. His own name of adoption is Devanam Priya, the beloved of the gods. Which gods? Surely the gods of the Aryan religion. Buddhism had no gods of its own. The idea that Ashoka was a kind of Buddhist Constantine declearing himself against paganism is a complete misreading of India conditions. Asoka was a kind or Buddhist Constantine declearing himself against paganism is a complete misreading of India conditions. Asoka was essentially a Hindu, as indeed was the founder of the sect to which he belonged."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_InMaury]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣ 1,700,000 ♥</b>km squared.

It covered an area of 15 KM long by 3 KM wide, and was surrounded with a moat, sewage systems, and a large wall with a reported 64 gates and 570 towers.

Following the conversion of King Ashoka to Buddhism, Sanskrit was of increasing importance. Greek and Aramaic translations of edicts also indicate a reliance on local languages. There was no common language to unify the entirety of India. This lack of a common language was somewhat mitigated by the use of two different written scripts, the Brahmi and the Kharoshthi. The regional dialects of prakrit and limited surviving examples makes estimates largely speculative.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_InMaury]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Genus ♣ Hinduism: 321-298BCE; Jain Traditions: 297-273BCE; Buddhism: 297-185BCE ♥</b> “During the last centuries before the Common Era, Hinduism was less visible than Buddhism and Jainism in India. The rulers of the Mauryan Empire (c. 324-185 B.C.E.) had supported Buddhism, and other kings in subsequent kingdoms also patronized the Buddhist and Jain monks.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_InMaury] “Candragupta is said to have been a Jaina and Bindusara, the father of Asoka, favoured the ajivikas, both of which were non-orthodox sects, and if anything were antagonistic to brahmanical ideas. It is therefore not surprising that Asoka himself did not conform to brahmanical theory and preferred to patronize the Buddhists.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_InMaury]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Genus ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion ♣ ♥</b>[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_InMaury][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Maurya Empire was one of the first geographically extensive empires in South Asia. The formation of the Mauryan Empire coincided with the invasion of India in the North-West of the armies of Alexander of Macedon in 327 BCE, most likely from territory in the Punjab.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_InMaury][MAJIDBENAM_BR]From circa 322 BCE until 187 BCE, the Mauryas extended their control over almost the entire subcontinent excluding Sri Lanka and the southernmost coast, as well as expanding northwest in Afghanistan.The exact origin of the empire is not clear.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_InMaury] The empire was built on the earlier model of the Nandas. The first three rulers, Chandragupta (324/321 BCE-297 BCE), Bindusara (297 BCE-273 BCE) and Ashoka (268 BCE-232 BCE) oversaw the main period of expansion and codification of the imperial state, with subsequent rulers attempting to preserve the gains made by the first three Kings until 187 BCE. Evidence of diplomacy between the Alexandrian successor state and the Mauryas Empire exist, though whether this was extensive is unclear.  Exact details of when the conquests of territory took place are also murky, but evidence seems to indicate that the majority took place under the founder King Chandragupta.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_InMaury][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The reign of Ashoka was a period of stability and marked the peak of the empire, as well as religious reform. The Maurya Empire entered a period of decline and instability following his death, with weak rulers overseeing a quickly fragmenting state facing outward invasion by Bactrian Greeks. Brihadratha would be the last ruler of the Maurya dynasty, killed by his military commander Pushyamitra in 187 BCE. The commander would be the founder of the successor state of the Shunga Dynasty. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_InMaury][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The King was the head of state, he controlled the military and  the bureaucratic administration.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_InMaury][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Empire was organized under a large bureaucracy and divided into four provinces named after the cardinal directions. Each province had a separate hierarchal administration, with the system duplicated at the capital to oversee the empire. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_InMaury][MAJIDBENAM_BR]A unique account of the Mauryan imperial administration  is preserved in The Arthasastra. A handbook  for governance which outlines a module of centralized government, although whether it is descriptive or an idealized version of the administration  is disputed. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_InMaury][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Population estimates for this period vary widely ranging from 18,000,000 to 100,000,000. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_InMaury] The Imperial Capital, Pataliputa was the largest settlement with an estimate of 50,000 inhabitants provided by (Clark 2013, 159).
