Here, we are interested in the phase of its prehistory known as the Early Formative period (c. 1200-801 BCE). During this period, sociopolitical hierarchies emerged and expanded throughout much of Mesoamerica more broadly, including the southern Valley of Mexico. This is evident, for example, in the establishment of a two-tiered settlement system,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_44_MxFormE] as well in the emergence of craft specialisation, specifically with regards to the manufacture of obsidian blades at sites such as Coapexco.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_45_MxFormE] Moreover, the Early Formative saw the earliest shared style in Mesoamerica, characterised by a standardized set of symbols, typically carved or incised on black, black-and-white, and white or white-slipped ceramics.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_46_MxFormE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Sanders et al. (1979) tentatively estimated that there were approximately 5,000 people in the Basin of Mexico around 1150 BC.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_47_MxFormE] However, no estimates could be found for the population of the average autonomous political unit. The largest known settlement, Tlatilco, may have had a population of as little as 1,000 inhabitants over 40 hectares,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_48_MxFormE] or between 2,000 and 4,000.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_49_MxFormE]</div></body></html>
