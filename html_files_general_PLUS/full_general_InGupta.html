'While he [Skanda-Gupta] is reigning, verily no man among his subjects falls away from <i>dharma</i>; there is no one who is distressed, in poverty, in misery, avaricious, or who, worthy of punishment, is over-much put to torture'. Such a glowing depiction of Gupta society is to be expected from a royal panegyric. It is, however, corroborated by an alien and presumably impartial eye-witness.//'The people are very well off, without poll tax or official restrictions . . . The kings govern without corporal punishment; criminals are fined according to circumstance, lightly or heavily. Even in cases of repeated rebellion they only cut off the right hand. The king's personal attendants, who guard him on the right and the left, have fixed salaries. Throughout the country the people kill no living thing nor drink wine, nor do they eat garlic or onions, with the exception of the Chandalas only'.//"To Fa Hian (Fa-hsien, Faxian, etc.), a Buddhist pilgrim from China who visited India in c. 400-410, Chandra-Gupta II's realm was indeed something of a utopia. [...] Only the lot of the Chandalas he found unenviable; outcastes by reason of their degrading work as disposers of the dead, they were universally shunned and had to give warning of their approach so that fastudious caste-members could take cover. But no other sections of the population were notably disadvantaged, no other caste distinctions attracted comment from the Chinese pilgrim, and no oppressive caste 'system' drew forth his surprised censure. Peace and order prevailed. [...] Trade continued to flourish, both within India and overseas."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_InGupta]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 320-515 ♥</b> "The kings with whom the Gupta golden age was to be identfiied arose from such modest origins that the founder of the ruling line appears to have adopted the name of the Mauryan founder, Chandragupta, when he began his own reign in 320 CE, and married a daughter of the ancient Licchavi clan."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_InGupta] "Skandagupta died around 467, and there was a long drawn-out war of succession between his sons and the sons of his half-brother, Purugupta. The winner of this war was Budhagupta, the son of Purugupta and the last of the great Gupta rulers. During his long reign (467 to 497) the empire remained more or less intact, but the war of succession had obviously sapped its vitality. The successors of Budhagupta, his brother Narasimha and Narasimha's son and grandson, who ruled until about 570, controlled only small parts of the empire. In east Bengal a King Vainyagupta is mentioned in an inscription of 507 and in the west one Bhanugupta left an inscription of 510. It is not known whether these rulers were related to the Gupta dynasty or not, but they were obviously independent of the Guptas of Magadha whose power declined very rapidly.//"The Huns must have noted this decline as they attacked India once more under their leader, Toramana. They conquered large parts of northwestern India up to Gwalior and Malwa. In 510 they clashed with Bhanugupta's army at Eran (Madhya Pradesh). Bhanugupta's general, Goparaja, lost his life in this battle. Coins provide evidence for the fact that Toramana controlled the Panjab, Kashmir, Rajasthan and presumably also the western part of what is now Uttar Pradesh. About 515 Toramana's son, Mihirakula, succeeded his father and established his capital at Sakala (Sialkot). [...] The Huns destroyed what was left of the Gupta empire in the northwest and the centrifugal forces were set free. They destroyed the cities and trading centres of northern India."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_InGupta]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ loose ♥</b> "In the Deccan and elsewhere beyond the frontiers of his Gangetic <i>arya-varta</i>, [Samudra-Gupta] had made no attempt at annexation. 'Uprooted' kings were reinstated, their territories restored, and the Gupta forces withdrawn. A one-off tribute was exacted and on this the Gupta court waxed wealthy[...]. But unlike the directly administered empire of the Mauryas, this was at best a web of feudatory arrangements and one which, lacking an obvious bureaucratic structure, left the sovereignty of the feudatories intact. [...] In the case of distant rulers a nominal submission looks to have been sufficient, while of those nearer at hand regular attendance on the <i>cakravartin</i> was also required."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_InGupta]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ Nominal: 320-390CE; Alliance: 390-514CE♥</b> "In the case of distant rulers a nominal submission looks to have been sufficient, while of those nearer at hand regular attendance on the <i>cakravartin</i> was also required."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_InGupta] "[...] the Guptas became involved with the Vakatakas, the dynasty which had succeded the Shatavahanas as the dominant power in the Deccan.//"For once, war was not the outcome; perhaps the campaign against the Satraps were taking their toll. Instead, the Guptas opted for a dynastic alliance whereby Chandra-Gupta II's daughter was married to Rudrasena II, the Vakataka king. The latter soon died and during the ensuing regency (c. 390-410) it was Prabhavati, this Gupta queen, who as regent controlled the Vakataka state in accordance with Gupta policy. Thereafter the Vakatakas continued as allies and associates of the imperial Guptas."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_InGupta]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Ujjain; Pataliputra ♥</b> "[...] Pataliputra, which along with Ujjain seems to have served as the Gupta capital[...]".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_InGupta]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Sanskrit; Prakrit ♥</b> "Fa-hein's record, inscriptions and literature all are testimony to the fact that the language of the cultured classes was Sanskrit while the lower classes spoke Prakrit."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_InGupta]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Genus ♣ Hinduism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Family ♣ Vaisnava Traditions ♥</b> "As is well-known, the Gupta epigraphical records refer to the kings of the Gupta dynasty as <i>paramabhagavatas</i>, which we can safely assume refers to their personal devotion to Visnu."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_InGupta]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Genus ♣ Buddhism ♥</b> "As is well-known, the Gupta epigraphical records refer to the kings of the Gupta dynasty as <i>paramabhagavatas</i>, which we can safely assume refers to their personal devotion to Visnu.
