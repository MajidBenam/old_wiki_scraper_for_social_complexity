This is the modern pronunciation of Chinese characters used in texts from the third to the seventh centuries to denote a kingdom centered in the lower Mekong Valley (see map 7).

Indeed in 502 after sending tribute to the Chinese court, including a Buddha statue made of coral, Jayavarman succeeded his son Fan Tang as “General of the Pacified South”; as general Jayavarman sent more tribute to the Chinese court in 511 and 514.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_KhFunaE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 225-540 CE ♥</b> Chinese records dating from the 3rd century C.E., beginning with the Sānguó zhì (Records of the Three Kingdoms) completed in AD 289 by Chén Shòu (233-297), record the arrival of two Funanese embassies at the court of Lǚ Dài, governor in the southern Chinese kingdom of Wú: the first embassy arrived between 225 and 230 AD, the second in the year 243.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_KhFunaE] The last Funan king was historically attested in 539 CE. 'According to the Chinese accounts, the last king of Funan was called Rudravarman and he was chiefly distinguished in their eyes because he offered the gift of a live rhinoceros to the Emperor at Beijing in 539 AD. After this, the historical record becomes somewhat blurred. For many years, it was believed that Funan declined or disappeared because it was threatened by the rise of another, more powerful state called Chenla or Zhenla to the north.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_KhFunaE] Note: 'Chenla' is the old spelling, the modern romanization of the Chinese character is 'Zhenla'. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_KhFunaE] 'Late in sixth century, 'Fu-nan' disappears from the Chinese record, and its place is taken by the Khmer city-states further north where minor rajas competed for hegemony.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_KhFunaE] 'In the 6th century Southeast Asian shipping to China linking China, Southeast Asia, and India began to shift from coastal sailing along the shores of Vietnam, Cambodia, and the peninsula, to a direct route across the South China Sea from Indonesia to southern China and northern Vietnam. Funan, the coastal polity dependent on maritime trade, apparently collapsed and was replaced in Cambodia by an entity known to the Chinese as 'Chenla', a state, or group of states, or pon-led communities based on the control of land and people, and extracting wealth from agriculture, and possibly inter-community trade, with little involvement in maritime activities.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_KhFunaE] 'In the lower reaches of the Mekong River in Vietnam, between the delta area and the Gulf of Thailand (Siam), lies OC ÈO, an archaeological site generally believed to be FUNAN, a kingdom that flourished in the third through seventh centuries C.E., hitherto known only through written source materials.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_KhFunaE] 'The CHINESE TRIBUTE SYSTEM was imposed on FU-NAN from the fourth century until its demise in the latter half of the sixth century.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_KhFunaE] 'Following the decline of Funan sea power by about the sixth century, the Khmers turned inland, to the country’s agricultural regions.'([MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_KhFunaE] 'It is clear, however, that in the third century the great expansion of Funan towards the Malay peninsula during which it subdued, or rather relegated to vassal status, a number of small states, gave way in the succeeding centuries to a reduction in the extent of its territory, ending around the fourth or fifth centuries in an area restricted to the southern parts of today's Cambodia and Vietnam.' [...] Thus Funan at the beginning of the sixth century would appear to have shrunk to what must have been its original core, the Mekong delta areas of today's Cambodia and Vietnam.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_KhFunaE] 'In 550 CE Chitrasena, borther of king Bhavarma, royal descendant of Hun Tian [Skt. Kaundinya] invaded Te Mu from the northern mountains bringing about the subsequent decline of the Fu Nan kingdom and the beginning of the Zhenla, at about 550-630 CE.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_KhFunaE] 'It dates to about 100-550 C.E. and was located on the delta of the Mekong and Bassac Rivers in modern Cambodia and Vietnam.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_KhFunaE] '205-225 CE: Rule of Fan Shih-Man, who draws other principalities into the  Funan orbit and is considered by some as the kingdom’s greatest ruler.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_KhFunaE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ confederated state ♥</b>'This passage gives the impression of Fu-nan as an empire, but modern scholars are distrustful of such a portrayal. It is likely that the communities involved were all relatively small city-states scattered along the coast; they could conduct raids upon one another, but there were no great tracts of territory settled by agriculturalist, and it is not likely that centralized control could extend over a large area. [...] Fu-nan, then, was less likely a dominant empire than the largest and most aggressive of a number of principalities.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_KhFunaE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]'We do not know if Funan was a unitary state, as the Chinese descriptions seem to suggest, or a series of competing centers. Whichever was the case, certain trends are found which were to contribute to the character of later complex polities in Southeast Asia. The handful of surviving inscriptions, for example, indicates that the local rulers adopted Sanskrit language and took Sanskrit names. Indian religious and legal systems were adopted as well.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_KhFunaE] 'There was a taxation system involving payment in gold, silver, perfumes, and pearls, and a script which originated in India.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_KhFunaE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]'Some historians suspect that the Chinese assumed that Funan’s political structure was more centralized than was really the case. No territorially based polities can be found in Southeast Asia before the imperial era of Angkor in the 11th and 12th centuries. It is unlikely that Funan was such a kingdom. More likely it was a typical early Southeast Asian mandala, in which political power manifested itself in the form of ability to extract tribute and occasional other tokens of subservience, but not direct rule of distant provinces. It is impossible to tell whether Funan could be defined as a unified state or as a cluster of small polities in the delta. Evidence in favor of territorial organization covering at least the lower Mekong includes extensive remains of a canal network and signs of the emergence of an elite stimulated by trade involving resources brought downriver from the hinterland.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_KhFunaE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]'We should think of Funan, therefore, not as a centralised kingdom extending from southern Vietnam all the way around to the Kra Isthmus, but rather as a mandala, the power of whose capital in southeastern Cambodia waxed and waned, and whose armed merchant ships succeeded in enforcing its temporary suzerainty over small coastal trading ports around the Gulf of Thailand. What gave Funan the edge over other such centres of power was clearly its position astride the India-China trade route. Its power, however, is unlikely to have spread far inland. Further north, on the middle Mekong and on the lower Chao Phraya River, other power centres were establishing themselves that in time would challenge and replace Funan.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_KhFunaE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]'The pre-Angkor scholar Michael Vickery has warned against assuming that Funan was a unified state—it is possible that it was a loose alliance of port towns in the lower Mekong delta. However, the existence of large canals suggests a strong state power capable of planning and managing the large numbers of labourers required for such projects. Such workforces would have depended on regular food supplies, produced by efficient agriculture and with an efficient tax collection system. On the other hand, we know that the city-states of Ancient Greece and Renaissance Italy were capable of building public works and large monuments without direction by overarching ‘national’ or supra-national polities, so Vickery is probably right about pre-Angkorean Cambodia.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_KhFunaE] 'The area was occupied in the prehistoric period, and the inhabitants prospered with the control of the international maritime trade to create a vigorous and powerful state.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_KhFunaE] 'Chinese sources awarded this area, known as “Funan,” an exaggerated political solidity, for in truth what Chinese writers, eager to flatter their emperor, described as a substantial tributary kingdom seems to have been no more than an unstable network of superficially Indianized ports and small principalities'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_KhFunaE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]'Combining the assumptions of Chinese sources with their own bias in favor of consolidated states, early European scholars portrayed Champa as a unified kingdom, with a hierarchy of provincial functionaries and a centralized administration.19 Recent research has substantially modi- fied that view, preferring to see Champa (like neighboring Funan) even at its height as a loose confederation of local polities which might com- bine for longer or shorter periods under powerful leaders, but which retained a basic autonomy grounded in the self-sufficiency of small east-west river valleys and isolated coastal plains, and perhaps in an irreducibly polycentric world view. Not infrequently, Cham principali- ties fought one another. A hegemon became merely “king of the kings (raja di raja) of Champa,” and the location of the preeminent center - when such a center existed - shifted: in the 8th century, which may have seen the first sustained coalescence, Panduranga dominated, in the late 9th century Indrapura, after c. 1000 Vijaya, and in the 16th century Kauthara and Panduranga.20 It would be foolish to assume that Cham political structures remained frozen for centuries.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_KhFunaE] 'The elements of a social overlay to the archaeological record are found in the surviving texts: we read of kings, a legal system, taxation, warfare and sujugation of rivals. Yet important issues remain unresolved. Was there, for example, a unitary state which straddled the delta, or were there a series of competing polities?'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_KhFunaE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]'At any given time dozens of lesser kings would have been paying tribute to Funan; the loss of much of that revenue and the peace it signaled led to the eventual re- placement of Funan by Chenla as the dominant force in the mandala system of Southeast Asia.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_KhFunaE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]'Through connections to India that remain somewhat unclear the Funanese practiced Hinduism, used a script adapted from Sanskrit, and utilized a god-king model of state organization similar to that of ancient India.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_KhFunaE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ nominal allegiance ♥</b> 'ANNAM.

The accompanying ceremonial established status hierarchy, but not vassalage in the Southeast Asian sense. It was acceptable for envoys to show proper respect to the Chinese emperor, just as Chinese envoys paid their respects to Southeast Asian kings; but with the exception of Vietnam, no ruler of a major Southeast Asian kingdom ever voyaged to Beijing to pay homage in person.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_KhFunaE] 'Both sought to maximise power through manipulation of ideologies of legitimation and world order. But what for the Chinese was the permanent order of the relation between Heaven, Earth and humankind represented by the emperor was, for Southeast Asian rulers, the temporary configuration of the ever-changing play of karma. And what for the Chinese was tribute offered in submission to the Son of Heaven was, for Southeast Asian rulers, polite recognition of superior status as a prerequisite for mutually beneficial trade.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_42_KhFunaE] 'The political culture of Funan and the region it dominated arose from the Indian mandala system in which concentric circles of kings who ruled a small area paid tribute to the king one step closer to the center. For much of the period of Funan’s existence the central king was the Chinese emperor, to whom most Funanese kings paid some form of tribute. After the Chinese emperor the king of Funan was second in importance in all of mainland East Asia and pre- dominant in Southeast Asia.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_43_KhFunaE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Iron Age chiefdoms ♥</b> "there was a network of bronze-using communities from the mouths of the Mekong river up to the Khorat plateau, and extending into the surrounding uplands"  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_44_KhFunaE] Most of the sites are closely connected to the Mekong river and its tributaries, and cultural links can be established with North-eastern Thailand and central Vietnam. The general characteristics of this period of time in the region are local bronze casting, wooden houses made on stilts on the riverside, presence of shell bangles, fish hooks, stone adzes, pottery, and ceramic anvils.

A network of canals connect the coast to Funan’s agricultural upstream, centered on its urban ‘‘capital’’ at the archeological site of Angkor Borei in modern southern Cambodia. It is unclear whether this canal network required a new level of techno- logical competence or a central leadership for its construction (Malleret:1959-1963; Liere: 1980; Stark: 1998, 2003, 2006a, 2006b; Stark and Sovath: 2001).'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_56_KhFunaE] 'If Funan were a unitary state its capital is not known, with conflicting claims made by modern writers for Vyadhapura, Angkor Borei, Banteay Prei Nokor and even Prey Veng, all situated in the Mekong delta or reasonably close to it.

A further point worthy of note is that, in both this embassy and its successor in 503, the Funanese king is said to have sent Buddhist presents to the emperor, including two ivory stùpas and a coral buddha image (Majumdar 1953, 32), a sound indication that Buddhist ideas and practice had, in some form, infiltrated royal circles."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_75_KhFunaE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion ♣ ♥</b>Funan State (red) 285 CE [MAJIDBENAM_REF_76_KhFunaE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]'Funan' is the name the Chinese gave to the polity (or cluster of polities) that, between the 3rd and the 7th centuries CE, ruled over much of the southern portion of mainland Southeast Asia ‒ including territory that is today southern Vietnam, Thailand, and Myanmar, as well as all of Cambodia.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_77_KhFunaE] Most likely, what we now know as Funan emerged from Iron Age settlements around the Mekong Delta and the banks of the Mekong river.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_78_KhFunaE] The best known of these settlements is the archaeological site of Oc Èo ‒ hence the name 'culture of Oc Èo' to describe mainland Southeast Asian culture at this time.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_79_KhFunaE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Because it is difficult to pinpoint precisely when Funan was founded, here we use 225 CE as our start date. According to written records, this was the year in which the first Funanese embassy visited the Southern Chinese kingdom of Wu.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_80_KhFunaE] We selected 539 CE as our end date, corresponding to the year King Rudravarman offered the gift of a live rhinoceros to the emperor at Beijing. This is the last time a Funanese ruler is mentioned in any existing records, and indeed it seems that Funan entered a period of gradual decline around this time, until it was supplanted by the Northern Cambodian state of Chenla or Zhenla in the 7th century.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_81_KhFunaE] Chenla is the older spelling, the modern romanization of the Chinese character is Zhenla. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_82_KhFunaE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Funan was rather prosperous, due to its privileged position at the crossroads of important trade routes that linked with India and China. Sources suggest that it reached its peak either in the mid-3rd century (when it extended its influence into Malaysia)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_83_KhFunaE] or between the end of the 5th and the beginning of the 6th century (when it was ruled by King Kaundinya Jayavarman and reached its maximum territorial extent, as well as the zenith of its political and economic power).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_84_KhFunaE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]It is not entirely clear whether Funan was a unitary state, as suggested by Chinese records, or a cluster of competing centres, or indeed the most powerful out of many such polities.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_85_KhFunaE] The highest political authority was probably something like a Mon-Khmer <i>poñ</i>, that is, a settlement chief. There may have been a loose hierarchy of poñ, possibly based on wealth and political influence, with the wealthiest and most powerful poñ viewed as 'kings' by the Chinese.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_86_KhFunaE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]No population estimates for Funan could be found in the literature, as work continues to locate and study settlements from this period. However, it is worth noting that the site of Oc Èo may have covered 450 hectares, with a possible population of many thousands of people.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_87_KhFunaE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Funan Kingdom ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Funan_200CE: 225CE-299CE; Funan_300CE: 300CE-399CE; Funan_400CE: 400CE-499CE ♥</b>  Funan_200CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_88_KhFunaE] Funan_300CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_89_KhFunaE] Funan_400CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_90_KhFunaE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  535015: 225CE-299CE;  444749: 300CE-399CE;  495593: 400CE-499CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Austroasiatic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Khmericic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Old Khmer ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Hinduism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Shaivism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition ♣ Buddhism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religion Family ♣ Mahayana Buddhism ♥</b></div></body></html>
