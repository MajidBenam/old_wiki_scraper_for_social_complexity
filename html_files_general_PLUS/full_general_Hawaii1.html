If it should be coded, however, 1200ce (the end of the time period) makes sense because this was when the population was the largest and the society presumably the most developed. [The period when the polity was at its peak, whether militarily, in terms of the size of territory controlled, or the degree of cultural development. This variable has a subjective element, but typically historians agree when the peak was.]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 1000-1200 CE ♥</b> Justification for starting date: It is approximately the date of initial settlement. Based on the most up-to-date information, Kirch[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_Hawaii1] concludes that the islands were likely first settled between 800CE and 1000CE. Some have argued for an earlier settlement, as early as 300CE, and in earlier works, Kirch found this scenario plausible[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_Hawaii1][MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_Hawaii1]. New starting date following an exchange with Patrick Kirch: "Most archaeologists would now say that initial Polynesian settlement did not occur until about AD 1000. Refer to Athens et al. 2014, American Antiquity 79:144-155 for latest Bayesian estimate of the chronology of Hawaiian colonization." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_Hawaii1]Justification for ending date: 1200CE is when most of the changes characteristic of Kirch’s ‘expansion period’ began, including a rapid rise in population[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_Hawaii1].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ quasi-polity ♥</b> Inferred.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_Hawaii1] There was little stratification at this time, and probably no ‘state’ in any real sense. 'Hawaii 1 is very difficult to say, but most likely to have been several independent polities - maybe as many as 5 or 6. 'Umi-a-Liloa is said to have been the first to consolidate all of these into one island-wide polity, and he is dated genealogical estimation to ca. AD 1570-1590, toward the end of your Hawaii2 period'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_Hawaii1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣  ♥</b> Thought to be first human settlement - although petroglyphs found possibly dating to 300 CE.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Hawaii II ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ none ♥</b> Inferred[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_Hawaii1] There was no developed urbanism[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_Hawaii1].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Old Hawaiian ♥</b> The settlers probably came from the Marquesas, so they presumably spoke an old version of Marquesan.

Recent estimates for the date of initial settlement by Polynesian voyagers have varied from 800 to 1250 CE, but the latest Bayesian model, based on palaeoenvironmental data and a carefully defined set of archaeological radiocarbon dates, suggests that the archipelago was first colonized between 1000 and 1100.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_Hawaii1] Our 'Hawaii 1' designates the earliest phase of Hawai'i's prehistory, from around 1000 to 1200, before most of the changes characteristic of Kirch's 'expansion period', including a rapid rise in population, took place.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_Hawaii1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]According to reconstructions of Hawaiki, the ancestral Polynesian homeland, ancient Polynesians recognized the authority of the <i>*ariki</i>, that is, the head of a lineage, who had both secular and sacred authority and was in charge of most, if not all, rituals.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_Hawaii1] However, a few thousand years separate Ancestral Polynesians from the earliest Hawaiians, and it is not clear how much the latter retained of the former's culture and sociopolitical organization. The earliest island-wide unitary kingdom on the Big Island emerged around 1580;[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_Hawaii1] before then the Big Island was probably divided into several small, independent polities.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_Hawaii1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The founding population was probably about 100 people, due to the limited capacity of the canoes the first settlers likely used to reach the islands.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_Hawaii1] This population probably grew somewhat between 1000 and 1200, but no up-to-date estimates could be found in the literature — an estimate of 20,000 inhabitants for the entire archipelago around 1100 dates to 1985, when the earliest phase of human occupation was thought to have begun around 600 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_Hawaii1]</div></body></html>
