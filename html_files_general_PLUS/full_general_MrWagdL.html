Instead, they suggest it gradually collapsed at the end of the 11th century, and no longer played an important commercial role from the 13th century onwards.

Rainfall increased and became plentiful during the period up to about AD 1100, promoting the expansion of both local and long-distance trade networks. Population densities increased too - of both humans and livestock - and a conjunction of internal and external influences transformed the political structure of some ethnic groups from the age-set system which dispersed authority through the community to a system favouring centralized control and the formation of states."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_MrWagdL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"the only area in which we can convincingly assert that a kingdom existed in the period under review was at the western edge of the Sudan, where the kingdom of Ghana was certainly in existence by +700 and could have been emerging for up to a thousand years."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_MrWagdL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Ghana I ♥</b> Wagadu Cisse Dynasty</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Mali Empire ♥</b> "ancient Ghana" "in the eleventh century was succeeded by Mali and then Kanem-Bornu in the fourteenth century, which in turn fell to Songhay in the fifteenth century."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_MrWagdL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ Mande ♥</b> Soninke are Mande peoples.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Kumbi Saleh ♥</b>Al-Zuhri (c1130-1155 CE) "considered Ghana the capital of the Janawa" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_MrWagdL]  Royal capital of Ghana kingdom has yet to be found.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_MrWagdL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"In the course of Ghana's long history, the king's capital was undoubtably moved from one place to another."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_MrWagdL] The last capital was Kumbi Saleh, "about 320 kilometres north of modern Bamako.

Its dominant people, a northern Mande group known as the Soninke, called it 'Wagadu',[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_MrWagdL] and Berber traders from the Sahara referred to it as 'Awkar'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_MrWagdL] The polity reached its peak in the mid-11th century:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_MrWagdL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_MrWagdL] at this stage, its influence extended east and north from the Senegal River into modern Mauritania and Mali[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_MrWagdL] and it was encroaching on the Niger Inland Delta.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_MrWagdL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_MrWagdL] However, from the late 11th century CE the Ghana Empire began to decline due to a combination of environmental, social and political factors. As the desert expanded into previously productive agricultural land,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_MrWagdL] the Sosso people took control of a large region above the Upper Niger River[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_MrWagdL] and the city of Walata grew in influence, taking over as the main southern terminus of the trans-Saharan trade.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_MrWagdL] The empire of Ghana officially converted to Islam in 1075‒77 CE to foster political and commercial ties with Almoravid newcomers,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_MrWagdL] while traditional religion retained its prominence in the hinterland and among the non-elite classes.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_MrWagdL] The consensus within modern scholarship is that the relationship between the Soninke and the Almoravids was generally cordial and fruitful, that the Wagadu capital had been host to an important Muslim community in the centuries before the Almoravids arrived, and that the Wagadu conversion to Islam was in fact a gradual affair.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_MrWagdL] Ghana recovered part of its power in the 12th century.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_MrWagdL] Ultimately, however, the shift in the regional balance of power led many of the Soninke to relocate to more prosperous areas,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_MrWagdL] contributing to the spread of Islam in other areas of the Sudan.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_MrWagdL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Wagadu empire comprised four provinces administered by a central government.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_MrWagdL] The king exerted direct authority over his kingdom; he was also head of the traditional religion and was revered as a god.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_MrWagdL] Wagadu society was highly hierarchical, distinguishing between the elite warrior class and the rest of the population: professional artisans including smiths, weavers, dyers and shoemakers; farmers and herders; and slaves.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_MrWagdL] These groups were further subdivided along clan lines.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_MrWagdL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]This period was a prosperous one for the Sudanese region, which produced millet, maize, yam, groundnuts, cotton, indigo and other crops.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_MrWagdL] Linked into a thriving exchange sphere that stretched north to North Africa and the Mediterranean,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_MrWagdL] the Sudanese population exported gold, slaves, hides, and ivory and imported copper, silver beads, dried fruit and cloth.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_MrWagdL] All exports and imports were taxed by the centralized state.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_MrWagdL] Trading outposts in Awdhagust and other Saharan towns facilitated fruitful exchange with Berbers and other groups from further afield.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_42_MrWagdL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Population estimates are difficult to obtain for ancient Ghana. However, it is worth noting that its capital, the thriving trading city of Kumbi Saleh, covered 250 hectares and had a population of 15,000-20,000 people at its peak.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_43_MrWagdL] Archaeological investigations at the site have revealed two-storey stone buildings which may have contained stores on the ground floor, narrow streets with densely packed houses, a mosque, and extensive cemeteries.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_44_MrWagdL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Late Wagadu Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Ghana_1100CE: 1078CE-1199CE; Ghana_1200CE: 1200CE-1203CE ♥</b> Ghana_1100CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_45_MrWagdL] Ghana_1200CE: [MAJIDBENAM_REF_46_MrWagdL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  138606: 1078CE-1199CE;  120562: 1200CE-1203CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Mande ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Mande ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Mande ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Sahel Religion ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Ghanese Religion ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition ♣ Islam ♥</b></div></body></html>
