[Indo-european]: early Greek[MAJIDBENAM_BR]With the fall or weakening of the great Eastern Mediterranean powers--the Hittites, the Assyrians, Egypt--there is evidence for a correspondingly "troubled" phase in Crete's prehistory. Most notably, the population moved from the coast to the hinterland, suggesting the coasts were no longer safe. Minoan culture continued to exist in some form, but contacts with the rest of the world were greatly reduced[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_GrCrFPa][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Firth estimated the Cretan population during Late Minoan IIIA and IIIB periods (1400-1200 BCE) at 110,000 people[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_GrCrFPa] There are no estimates for the Final Post Palatial Period; settlement patterns, however, point to a considerable population decrease, especially during the 1100-1000 BCE period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_GrCrFPa][MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_GrCrFPa] Similarly, not much is known about political organization at this time.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_GrCrFPa]</div></body></html>
