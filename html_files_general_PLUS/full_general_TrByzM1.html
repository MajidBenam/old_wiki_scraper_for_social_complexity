It claimed to be at the apex of the family of kings; it was the father, they were the sons. ... It was only with the Arab rulers that there had long been some recognition of equality, and also with the Persian kings, which was reflected in the title of 'brother' used in official documents."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_TrByzM1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣ [15,000,000-20,000,000]  ♥</b>km squared.

This and other developments led to a dramatic transformation of Byzantium with regard to dimension and complexity of the society.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_TrByzM1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The signature change was the reform of Byzantine control of the regions with the introduction of themes introduced under Constantine IV 668-685 CE[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_TrByzM1] headed by commanders called strategi.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_TrByzM1] This was a progressive development as provinces still existed with the first themes, the last European theme (Nicopolis or Dalmatia) being set up about 900 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_TrByzM1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Reform of the regions into themes was directly reflected with administrative reforms at the capital. At the professional imperial administration in Constantinople, taxation and military administration was 'fused' about 680 CE into a single office called 'logothete tou stratiotikou.' "In this office, taxation and military administration were made the responsibility of one minister in the central government. The officials concerned with the muster rolls of the soldiers and with the collection of the annona were thus combined in a single functionary."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_TrByzM1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]From Justinian II (r.668-711 CE) the strategi gained powers of tax collection and each individual theme had a logothete who behaved like the logothete tou stratiotikou in Constantinople.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_TrByzM1] "Thus there grew up this fusion of military and civil authority which spread over the whole Empire with the introduction of the themes and undermined the control exercised by the state."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_TrByzM1] However, while control from the center was lost, the Byzantines gained the ability to more flexibly respond to external threats.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]After the shock of losing 1 million km2 of territory by 700 CE to the expanding Islamic Caliphate the reforms eventually appear to have put the Byzantine state, and its 5 million inhabitants, on a stronger footing.
