[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_EgThebL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]After Seshong I (945-924 BCE) monarchy weakened, power of provincial rulers increased and there was "fragmentation of the country." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_EgThebL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The political picture that emerges as the Third Intermediate Period progresses is one of a federation of semi-autonomous rulers, nominally subject (and often related) to an overlord-king." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_EgThebL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Thebes and Tanis functioned as independent centers of power. They were the seats of parallel dynaties ... The official characterization of government in the two places was distinct - religious in Thebes and secular in Tanis - and the holders of power were related by blood and marriage and most often worked in unison in a system they both accepted. Scholars have likened the arrangement to a concordat, the division of power between popes and kings in European history."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_EgThebL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Third Intermediate Period was "an era of political decentralization in the Nile Valley".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_EgThebL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Egypt - New Kingdom Ramesside Period ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ elite migration ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Egypt - Kushite Period ♥</b> <i>This could in future be changed for the short Hermopolis period in Upper Egypt.</i> Last king in this period was Sheshong III (827-773 BCE) and after him "numerous local rulers - particularly in the Delta - became virtually autonomous and several declared themselves kings."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_EgThebL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ Libyan tribes ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣ 350,000 ♥</b> km squared.

They include: 1. A renewed "quest for new religious solutions which emphasized individual salvation. Generally, people were perhaps less optimistic that a virtuous life would bring them a blessed eternity, and more reliance was placed on the gods as a source of comfort. Traditional preparations for the afterlife continued, but people were also determined to enjoy their daily pleasures while they were still alive." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_EgThebL] 2. "Although weak and foreign dynasties tried to revive the myth of the god-king in order to support their royal status, the political power of the king continued to decline, along with his influence on religion." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_EgThebL] 3. An "increased association between the temples and lay people. One noticeable feature was an increase in the custom of setting up personal statues inside the temples so that the owners could benefit from the regular rituals for the gods (which were the same as those performed in earlier periods), and thus receive sustenance from the divine food offerings. It also emphasized the owner's devotion to the god, and gave him a claim on the deity's attention. This tradition emphasized the fact that the gods were now regarded as better guarantors of individual postmortem protection than the age-old mortuary cults." "One of the most characteristic developments of this later period is the importance of animal cults." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_EgThebL] 4. "One of the most characteristic developments of this later period is the importance of animal cults." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_EgThebL] Because it doesn't seem that these changes affected most of the variables we are interested in, it seems reasonable to infer continuity with earlier periods in terms of equality, prosociality, slavery, human sacrifice, and morality. Indeed, the the first millennium BCE was characterised by a "deep-rooted revival of things past that affected many aspects of Egypt's court culture, religion, script, literature, art, architecture, and burial practices."

He embarked on an 'ambitious royal building programme' and attempted to regain control of the entirety of Egypt, curtail Thebes' independence, and expand into the Levant.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_EgThebL] The high point did not last long. The perennial problem of Upper Egyptian independence eventually led to the formal division of the state, an imaginative if drastic solution that created a parallel Twenty-third Dynasty based in Leontopolis, or perhaps Herakleopolis.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_EgThebL] The new dynasty was enjoined to reassert control of the south, allowing the Twenty-second Dynasty rulers to concentrate on Lower Egypt.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_EgThebL] This did not work: by the time of Shoshenq III (r. 827-773 CE), the Twenty-second Dynasty pharaohs could barely even control the north: 'numerous local rulers - particularly in the Delta - became virtually autonomous and several declared themselves kings'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_EgThebL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Unfortunately, due to scant evidence, there are no reliable population estimates for this time.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Egypt Theban Period ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Egypt21st_1000BCE: 1069BCE-901BCE; Egypt22nd_900BCE: 900BCE-801BCE; Egypt23rd_800BCE: 800BCE-747BCE ♥</b>  Egypt21st_1000BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_42_EgThebL] Egypt22nd_900BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_43_EgThebL] Egypt23rd_800BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_44_EgThebL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  544146: 1069BCE-901BCE;  315042: 900BCE-801BCE;  115320: 800BCE-747BCE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Afro-Asiatic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Egyptian-Coptic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Egyptian (Ancient) ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Ancient Egyptian Religion ♥</b></div></body></html>
