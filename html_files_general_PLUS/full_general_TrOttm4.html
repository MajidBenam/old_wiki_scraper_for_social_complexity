The Sufi orders (see Sufism), which put Ali and the prophet’s descendants at the center of their devotions, were much more popular in the early Ottoman Empire. But in 1501 Shah Ismail I (r. 1501-24) made Imami Shiism the religion of his court in Iran and began to persecute Sunni Muslims in his realm. In addition, the Turkoman tribes of eastern Anatolia rose in rebellion against the Ottomans, proclaiming Shah Ismail to be the long-awaited imam who would restore justice to the world. These rebels were known as the Kizilbaş in Ottoman texts and were ruled as heretics by the Ottoman Sunni legal establishment, making it legally permissible for the Ottoman army to kill them. The Shii rebellion against the Ottomans was temporarily ended by the Battle of Çaldiran in 1512. But the continued presence of a hostile Shii Iran played a significant role in bolstering the Ottoman attachment to Sunni Islam. With the hostile “heretic” Shia on their eastern borders and the ongoing anti-Muslim challenges from the Christian world, the Ottoman sultans were increasingly motivated to present themselves as the upholders and defenders of what they regarded as the true faith of Sunni Islam. [...] The embrace of Sunni orthodoxy by the Ottoman political and legal elite did not translate, however, into the persecution of those Shiis in the empire who accepted Ottoman rule peacefully, even if they held the view that such rule was illicit in the absence of the imam. This tolerance was especially manifested in the Ottoman treatment of the Shia of Iraq. When Süleyman I (r. 1520-66) conquered Baghdad in 1535, for instance, he endowed Shii shrines as well as Sunni ones and hosted Shii clergy along with their Sunni counterparts. Subsequent Ottoman governors extended this strategy of tolerance and even provided patronage to Shii shrines and clergy. In part, this was due to a realization that it was best not to alienate the Shii subjects of the sultan in Iraq. But it also seems to have arisen out of a more general cultural practice of tolerance that the sultans extended to both nonSunnis and non-Muslims."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_TrOttm4]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion ♣ Hanafi ♥</b> "The Ottoman dynasty established the Hanafi tradition as the official legal interpretation of the empire, but it did not compel scholars to abandon their own legal traditions to conform to that favored in Istanbul. Nevertheless, if a scholar wished to ingratiate himself with the new regime a switch might seem prudent."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_TrOttm4]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Genus ♣ Islam ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Family ♣ Sufi ♥</b> "Despite sultanic support of some Sufi orders, Sufis also sometimes challenged the sultans’ authority by claiming they had access to a truth that could never be known by those who had not embarked on the path of mysticism. In the aftermath of the defeat of Sultan Bayezid I (r. 1389-1402) at Ankara in 1402, the Sufi Sheikh Bedrettin preached in favor of a social movement that sought to tear down the differences between classes and religions. His movement gained great popularity among the ordinary people of all religions and his disciple, Börlüce Mustafa, started a revolt against the Ottoman in 1416. The rebels had some initial success but the Ottoman army was finally able to defeat them and Bedrettin and thousands of his followers were executed. The Ottomans also faced other revolts led by radical Sufis in the 15th and 16th centuries. Indeed, one of the greatest challenges to the Ottoman throne came from Shah Ismail, who headed an extremist Sufi order that believed him to be the long-awaited hidden imam."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_TrOttm4]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion ♣ ♥</b> "Once they had established their empire, the Ottoman sultans had close relations to two Sufi groups, the Mevlevi Order and the Bektaşi Order, although these two could not be more different in their religious outlook. The Mevlevi Order, founded by the son of the 13th century poet Rumi, was the order of Ottoman intellectuals and attracted poets, musicians, and calligraphers. The order established convents or hostels (tekke) in various Ottoman cities and these served as centers for the teaching of art and music as well as being places of spiritual retreat. The Bektaşi Order, by contrast, was the order of the Janissaries and its traditions were oral rather than literary. Although many of its practices were unorthodox, such as the drinking of wine, it too received official recognition from the sultans as a way of keeping the troops happy. The sultans and their families supported both orders financially by establishing some of their convents and bestowing lavish gifts on the orders’ sheikhs. [...] In the second half of the 18th century, a more austere and rigorous Sufi order, the Naqshbandiyya Order, answered some of the objections raised by the Muslim fundamentalists to Sufism. The Naqshbandis believe in a strict adherence to sharia and reject the notion of sainthood found in many other Sufi orders, but they still hold that the understanding of God that can only be gained from a mystical experience is a vital, necessary part of Islam. The sober interpretation of mysticism offered by the Naqshbandiyya Order was popular among intellectuals within the Ottoman Empire in the 18th and 19th centuries as it offered a compromise between mysticism and the interpretations of Islam that fundamentalists such as the Wahhabis were preaching. However, critics of Sufism still did not accept the Naqshbandiyya as being rooted in a proper understanding of Islam."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_TrOttm4]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Genus#2 ♣ Islam ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Family#2 ♣ Shia ♥</b> "Although Sunni Islam, as interpreted by the Hanafi School of law, was the state religion of the Ottoman Empire, there were sizeable Shii minorities in several of the Ottoman Arab provinces, most notably in what are today the countries of Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen. In the first two, the Shia followed the Imami tradition. The dominant form of Islam in Iran today, the Imami tradition is known to some Western scholars as “Twelver Shiism” as its believers hold that the 12th imam, who vanished in the ninth century c.e., will return at some future time to institute a reign of absolute justice on earth. In Lebanon, the adherents of this community were known as the Mitwallis in the Ottoman period, although it is not a name they use today to refer to themselves. Both the Imami tradition and the Zaydi tradition followed by the Shia of Yemen trace the descent of their imams from the line of the sixth imam, Jaafar al-Sadiq (702-65), but the Imami trace their tradition through Sadiq’s son Musa al-Kazim while the Zaydi trace their tradition through his son Muhammad. In addition, the Alawis of Syria and the Alevis of eastern Anatolia also claim to be Shia although the Shii clergy in Iran did not accept the Alawi claim until the 20th century."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_TrOttm4]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion#2 ♣ Twelver ♥</b> "Although Sunni Islam, as interpreted by the Hanafi School of law, was the state religion of the Ottoman Empire, there were sizeable Shii minorities in several of the Ottoman Arab provinces, most notably in what are today the countries of Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen.

However, the dynasts in Istanbul successfully retained power behind a protective veil of elite slaves, acquired by tribute from conquered provinces and raised and educated to run the government and military. The Ottoman 'slave-elite' differed from that of the Mamluk Sultanate in that the Ottoman slaves could never achieve the position of sultan, which remained the hereditary property of the Osman dynasty. Although this failed to prevent palace intrigues or succession crises, the sultans of this period made progress toward greater unification of the empire's dense patchwork of languages and ethnicities. Trading on their successful military conquests, the Ottoman sultans claimed the title of 'caliph of all the Muslims in the world'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_TrOttm4][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Ottoman Empire was a hereditary dynasty under the rule of an Ottoman Sultan.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_TrOttm4] The Ottoman 'slave-elite' differed from that of the Mamluk Sultanate in that the Ottoman slaves could never achieve the position of sultan, which remained the hereditary property of the Osman dynasty. With its capital in Istanbul, the main organ of state power was the 'elaborate court, palace, and household government'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_TrOttm4] Policy-making was weakly institutionalized: in theory, all decisions were made by the sultan himself, and so Ottoman policies were shaped by the sultan's personal character and by the 'individuals or factions who had his ear'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_TrOttm4] The sultans appointed their own staff and paid them with a wage or (increasingly after 1600 CE) a fief.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_TrOttm4] State funding came in large part from money raised by fief holders until Grand Vizier Ibrahim Pasha Kulliyesi introduced a property tax around 1718 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_TrOttm4][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The administrative and military officials around the sultan were slaves educated in palace schools.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_TrOttm4] The source of this non-Turkish administrative class was the <i>devsirme</i> tribute, which began in 1438 CE; by the 16th century about 1,000 boys were taken per year per recruiting province in the Balkans and non-Muslim communities in Anatolia. The system divided these slaves into those who would serve the bureaucracy and those who would form the elite military corps known as janissaries. In 1582 CE, recruits of non-devsirme origin, including free Muslims, were permitted to join the janissaries and after 1648 CE the devsirme system was no longer used to recruit for the janissaries.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_TrOttm4] The imperial household together with its armies and administrative officials was truly vast, numbering about 100,000 people by the 17th century.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_TrOttm4][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Ottoman sultans issued decrees to their approximately 24 million subjects through an imperial council (<i>divan</i>)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_TrOttm4] and the chief executive power below the sultan, the grand vizier.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_TrOttm4] Although certain regions (Egypt, for example) may have differed slightly in their governing structure, Ottoman regional government typically involved governors (<i>beylerbeyi</i>)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_TrOttm4] whose provinces were split into districts (<i>sanjaks</i>) under district governors (<i>sanjak beyi</i>).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_TrOttm4] The sanjak beyi also was a military commander.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_TrOttm4] Fief-holding soldiers were responsible for local law and order within their districts.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_TrOttm4] By the late 16th century, the lowest level of this system had transformed into a system of tax farms or fiefs given to non-military administrators.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_TrOttm4] In 1695 CE, these tax farms were 'sold as life tenures (<i>malikane</i>)', and later shares in tax farms were sold to the public.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_TrOttm4][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Ottoman law was divided into religious - Islamic sharia - and secular <i>kanun</i> law.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_TrOttm4] Kanun law essentially served to fill the gaps left by the religious legal tradition, regulating 'areas where the provisions of the sacred law were either missing or too much at at odds with reality to be applicable'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_TrOttm4] In the Ottoman Empire, this included aspects of criminal law, land tenure and taxation; kanun law drew its legitimacy from precedent and custom.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_TrOttm4] Military judges (<i>kadi'asker</i>) were the heads of the empire's judiciary and heard cases brought before the imperial council.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_TrOttm4]</div></body></html>
