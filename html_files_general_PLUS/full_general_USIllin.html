who played important diplomatic roles, such as conducting <i>calumet</i> (peace pipe) ceremonies for visitors, but had relatively little formal authority - and war chiefs, who organized raids on other settlements.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_USIllin][MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_USIllin][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the post-contact period (specifically in the late 17th century), the Illinois formed large villages close to French forts and trading posts, most notably the Grand Village of the Kaskaskia.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_USIllin] It has traditionally been assumed that these large settlements, which included Illinois speakers from various subgroups as well as Chickasaws, Shawnees and others, functioned almost as refugee centres as the Illinois fled attacks from the Iroquois to the east and clustered together in the wake of disease and depopulation.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_USIllin][MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_USIllin] Historian Robert Morrissey has offered an alternative interpretation, arguing that the large Illinois villages represented an aggressive 'bid for power' based on bison hunting and slave raiding and strategically positioned between the woodlands to the east and the grasslands of the west.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_USIllin] Nevertheless, what is not in doubt is that the Illinois suffered drastic population losses in the post-contact period, falling from around 12,000 people in 1680 to just 1,900 by 1763.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_USIllin]</div></body></html>
