[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_EgNKThu][MAJIDBENAM_BR]During the New Kingdom, the Egyptian king acquired the title of 'pharaoh', meaning 'great house'. In the Thutmosid Period, or Eighteenth Dynasty (1550-1293 BCE), the pharaohs turned the Egyptian 'home' into a great empire stretching from Kush in northern Sudan (conquered by Thutmose I) to the south to Palestine and Syria in the northeast (taken by Thutmose III).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_EgNKThu][MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_EgNKThu] For the first time, the capital of a great Egyptian state was in Upper Egypt, at Thebes (although in 1373 BCE Akhenaten briefly had the capital moved to El Amarna in Middle Egypt).[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The pharaoh, a living god-king, was also the chief priest, highest judge and top military commander; he usually fought in battle, as Thutmose III apparently did at the famous Bronze Age battle of Megiddo in the 15th century BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_EgNKThu] The professional army was augmented by troops from conquered places such as Nubia and Libya.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_EgNKThu][MAJIDBENAM_BR]During the New Kingdom, labyrinthine networks of imperial power and wage-earning agents we know as scribes[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_EgNKThu] were overseen by two viziers: one for the north and one for the south of Egypt.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_EgNKThu] The Egyptian vizier was the second-highest judge;[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_EgNKThu] he supervised the activities of the state bureaucracy and served as a representative of the pharaoh's interests.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_EgNKThu] Most of the viziers' duties seem to have been judicial, involving dispute settlement, answering petitions, and authorizing transfers of property.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_EgNKThu] For most of the two to three million people who occupied New Kingdom Egypt, however, the law was usually administered at the local level,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_EgNKThu] under chiefs of towns (the capitals of nomes) and mayors of villages.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The resources commanded by the New Kingdom Egyptian state enabled the pharaohs to carry out grand architectural and tomb-building projects.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_EgNKThu] The most prolific builder of the Thutmosid Period was a female pharaoh called Hatshepsut.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_EgNKThu] At Deir el-Medina, in the Valley of the Kings, opposite Thebes, a workers' village was created at the start of the Eighteenth Dynasty to house craftsmen dedicated to building royal tombs.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_EgNKThu] The community was managed by a palace scribe appointed by the vizier. The scribe oversaw supervisors, who managed two teams of five workers on ten-day shifts.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_EgNKThu] In the village, oracle statues attended by priests served as the 'highest local voice of authority'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_EgNKThu][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Although not a typical town, documents written by skilled workers at Deir el-Medina reveal that writing was not confined to the elite, but had become important in wider society.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_EgNKThu] Major temples across Egypt included libraries and archives, most likely managed by scribes educated in local schools.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_EgNKThu] Documents attesting to the sophistication of this Late Bronze Age state include government archives, wills, title deeds, census lists, conscription lists, orders, memos, tax lists, letters, journals, inventories, regulations, and transcripts of trials.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_EgNKThu]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Egypt New Kingdom ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ EgyptNew_1500BCE: 1550BCE-1401BCE; EgyptNew_1400BCE: 1400BCE-1293BCE ♥</b>  EgyptNew_1400BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_EgNKThu] EgyptNew_1500BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_EgNKThu]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  1095139: 1550BCE-1401BCE;  1036805: 1400BCE-1293BCE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Afro-Asiatic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Egyptian-Coptic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Egyptian (Ancient) ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Ancient Egyptian Religion ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Atenism ♥</b></div></body></html>
