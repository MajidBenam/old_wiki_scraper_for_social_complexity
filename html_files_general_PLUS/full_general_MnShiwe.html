They may have been the ancestors to the Mongols.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_MnShiwe][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Sources do not provide clear descriptions of Shiwei political organization, but it is worth noting that the Wuluohou, one of the Shiwei peoples, was believed by Chinese record-keepers to have no supreme leader, only tribal chiefs.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_MnShiwe] Similarly, sources do not provide clear population estimates for the Shiwei.</div></body></html>
