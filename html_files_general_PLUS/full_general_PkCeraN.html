By 5500, the people of Mehrgarh had begun to rely more on bovine and ovicaprine pastoralism for their meat, as opposed to hunting. Starting from around this time, there is also an increase in the number of known farming settlements in the region, most notably Kili Ghul Mohammad, Anjira, Siah Damb, and Rana Gundai. There is evidence for an increased range of craft activities and the first granaries appeared in Mehrgarh, as well as, perhaps, small-scale irrigation.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_PkCeraN][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]It is not possible to give an accurate estimate of the region's population at this time,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_PkCeraN] and the size of occupied Mehrgarh is uncertain, as the population shifted over time and part of the site has been cut away by the Bolan River.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_PkCeraN] Similarly, the literature does not provide many clues as to the political organization of Mehrgarh or any other site in the region during the period, although the appearance of granaries at Mehrgarh may suggest increasing social complexity.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_PkCeraN]</div></body></html>
