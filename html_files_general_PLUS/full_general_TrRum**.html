The first reliable evidence for the activities of Solaymān b. Qotlomoš, traditionally regarded as the founder of the Sultanate of Rum, indicates that because of the prestige of his Saljuq lineage he was called on in 1074 by some Turkmen of Syria to lead them" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_TrRum**][MAJIDBENAM_BR]1307 - the last full year of the reing of the last Saljuq sultan Masʿud II. Although Anatolia had already been under Mongol authority since 1240s. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_TrRum**][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"This first century of the Saljuq sultanate in Anatolia is the most obscure part of Saljuq history. Our understanding is inhibited by our lack of any local Muslim sources, so that we are mostly dependent on Christian sources in Syriac, Armenian, Latin, and above all Greek, as well as the occasional references in works by authors from the central Islamic lands, for whom Anatolia was an obscure frontier region. This poverty of information probably suggests that no local Muslim chronicles were written, for the historian Ebn-e Bibi (d. after 1285) remarked that it was impossible to find information about Anatolia before the reign of Ḡiāṯ-al-Din Kayḵosrow (Ebn-e Bibi, 1956, p. 11)."

This concept was the result of the synthesis of the ancient Iranian concept of kingship and Islamic notions and norms which resulted in the ideology usually called ‘Perso-Islamic autocracy’. [...] This ideology accommodated three important elements according to which the Great Seljuq sultan was an autocratic monarch, the guardian of Islam and the Muslims, and the loyal ally and deputy of the Abbasid caliph. The resulting duties of the sultan were the support of the Sunni Abbasid caliph and the protection of Islam and Muslims against heresy and unbelievers. He was obliged to uphold Islamic law, ascertain that the Muslim lands prospered and that justice prevailed in them. This concept of legitimate kingship remained the same down to the times of the Rum Seljuq successor states."

The regional apparatus was organised with military officials overseeing local tax collectors.
