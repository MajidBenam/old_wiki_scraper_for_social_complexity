The Emperor concluded matrimonial alliances with other prominent families, thus extending the Kadambas' influence over the rest of peninsular India [MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_InKadam]. Moreover, he created an internal "protective force" to ensure safe movement of people from one part of the empire to another[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_InKadam].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 345-550 CE ♥</b> The Kadamba Empire was founded more or less around the time of their rebellion in the face of their feudal overlords (possibly the Pallavas), and it ended with their defeat at the hands of the Chalukyas [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_InKadam].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ unitary state ♥</b> feudal empire; tripartite empire Inferred from the fact that the empire's provinces were not directly ruled by the Emperor, but by "viceroys" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_InKadam]. After Mrigashavarma's succession to the throne in 450, his brothers declared themselves independent rulers of their own territories, and the empire was therefore split into three smaller polities [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_InKadam]. In the literature, this appears to be considered more a "phase" in the empire's history than the beginning of three new polities, which is why I have elected not to create a separate page for whichever polity included the NGA we are interested in. Indeed, the polities would eventually reunite [MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_InKadam].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥</b> Independent polity.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Pallava Empire ♥</b> Though it is not entirely clear, it seems that the Kadambas started out as feudal subordinates to the Pallavas [MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_InKadam].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b> feudal subordinates[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_InKadam]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Chalukyas of Badami ♥</b> Chalukya Empire[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_InKadam]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Banavasi; Halsi; Triparvata; Uchchangi ♥</b> 345-455 CE: Banavasi; 455?-? CE: Halsi; 460-? CE: Triparvata; 460?-? CE: Uchchangi. The Kadambas' first capital was Banavasi [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_InKadam]. Once the Empire is split in three, each division had its own capital: Halsi for the North and West, Triparvata for the South, and Uchchangi for the East [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_InKadam]. However, none of the sources is clear regarding the dates in which these capitals were founded, and when they ceased to be capitals (as they must have done, considering that the empire was eventually reunited).</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Sanskrit; Prakrit; Kannada ♥</b> Prakrit and Sanskrit were official, court languages, while Kannada was probably the "colloquial" language [MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_InKadam]</div><div class='meatypart'></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Indo-Iranian; Dravidian ♥</b> Prakrit and Sanskrit are Indo-Iranian languages [MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_InKadam], Kannada is a Dravidian one [MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_InKadam].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://seshat.info/File:Kadambamaps.nelson.png">[1]</a>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Kadamba dynasty ruled over a region that largely falls within the boundaries of the modern-day Indian states of Karnataka and Maharashtra.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_InKadam] An absolute start date could not be found in the specialist literature. However, much is known about this polity's monarchs. Most notably, Kakushtavarma, widely regarded as the greatest Kadamba king, concluded marriage alliances with prominent ruling families (thus extending Kadamba influence over much of the subcontinent) and created an internal police force to ensure the safe movement of people from one part of the empire to another.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_InKadam] After Kakushtavarma, the empire was temporarily split among his heirs, each division with its own capital: Halsi for the north and west, Triparvata for the south, and Uchchangi for the east.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_InKadam] The empire was partly reunited a generation later under Ravivarma.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_InKadam] However, the polity disintegrated rapidly under Harivarma, and much of its territory was seized by the Chalukyas of Badami in the 540s CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_InKadam][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]In imitation of the Satavahanas, the Kadambas referred to their leader as <i>dharmamaharaja</i>[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_InKadam] The dharmamaharaja was assisted at court by a royal council and the crown prince, and in the provinces he was represented by viceroys and governors.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_InKadam][MAJIDBENAM_BR]No population estimates for this period could be found in the specialist literature.</div></body></html>
