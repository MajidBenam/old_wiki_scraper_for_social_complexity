Generally, the years 1185-1615[CE] are designated Japan’s medieval era, identified as such due to the advent of rule by the warrior class, feudal system of land allocation and administration, and characteristic political unrest.'

A process of national unification began to occur as the result of the military and political shrewdness of three central figures: the warriors Oda Nobunaga (1534-82[CE]), Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1536-98[CE]), and Tokugawa Ieyasu (1542-1616[CE]). Beginning with Nobunaga, these three gradually defeated and annexed smaller daimyo, leading eventually to complete control over Japan by the Tokugawa shogunate.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_JpAzMom]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Tokugawa Shogunate ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ Japanese ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Kyoto ♥</b> Kyoto was the official capital of the Japanese empire, and residence of the imperial family, from 794 until 1868. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_JpAzMom] For much of Japanese history, however,, the imperial family were figureheads and in practice did not control the country there were a number of other cities which were set up as administrative capitals which were inhabited by these wielding power. ‘The Azuchi-Momoyama period takes its  name from two castles built by warrior-rulers in the second half of the 16th century. Azuchi Castle was built by Oda Nobunaga on the shores of Lake Biwa near Kyoto. Toyotomi Hideyoshi built his castle, Momoyama (Peach Mountain), at Fushimi on what was then the outskirts of Kyoto.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_JpAzMom]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Middle Japanese: 1150-1550CE ♥</b>[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_JpAzMom]</div><div class='meatypart'></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Japonic ♥</b>The Azuchi-Momoyama period (1568-1603 CE), also known as the Shokuho period, is named for the castles built by the warrior rulers Oda Nobunaga (Azuchi) and Toyotomi Hideyoshi (Momoyama).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_JpAzMom] The Azuchi-Momoyama period marked the beginning of a process of national unification after the disorder of the Warring States period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_JpAzMom] The period starts with the rise to power of the military commander and regional lord Oda Nobunaga. With his defeat of the shogun Ashikaga Yoshiaki, he set about bringing the lesser <i>daimyō</i> (lords) under the control of a single military command.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_JpAzMom][MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_JpAzMom] In 1568 Nobunaga marched on, and occupied, the imperial capital of Kyoto, gaining effective control of the government.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_JpAzMom][MAJIDBENAM_BR]After the death of Nobunaga in 1582, his general Toyotomi Hideyoshi continued this process, gaining control of most of Japan by 1590 CE. In an attempt to expand Japan's territory overseas, Hideyoshi led two unsuccessful invasions of Korea in 1592 and 1597.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_JpAzMom] Hideyoshi's death in 1598, leaving a council of lords in charge until his young son came of age, sparked off a succession struggle. The general Tokugawa Ieyasu, a former ally of Oda Nobunaga, emerged victorious from the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, cementing his power. After his victory, he was appointed shogun in 1603, founding the Tokugawa Shogunate which would dominate Japan for the next 200 years.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_JpAzMom][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]While the generals Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu consolidated power into a military confederation, the emperor remained the nominal head of state throughout the period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_JpAzMom] Although the older social order remained largely intact, with peasants subservient to feudal lords, Oda Nobunaga's policy of annexing lands and awarding them to his loyal retainers reshaped the power relations between lords and enabled the consolidation of his own power.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_JpAzMom] Toyotomi Hideyoshi was instrumental in creating a strict and finely graded social hierarchy of warriors, farmers, artisans, and merchants, a structure that would be institutionalized in the succeeding Tokugawa period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_JpAzMom][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Population estimates for the area under Azuchi-Momoyama control range from roughly 17 million in 1500 CE to 22 million in 1600 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_JpAzMom] The imperial capital, Kyoto, remained the largest settlement with approximately 300,000 inhabitants.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_JpAzMom]</div></body></html>
