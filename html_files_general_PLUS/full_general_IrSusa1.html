These chiefdoms would have been based on a system of staple finance rather than on the unequal distribution of prestige items. In this case, power would have been based on the control over water, land, and labor. Elsewhere, especially in the more isolated regions of the highlands, relatively small, self-sufficient, autonomous villages probably continued to exist throughout the Late Chalcolithic." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_IrSusa1] In this book the Late Chalcolithic corresponds to the period between 3900 and 3500 BCE.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Susiana - Late Ubaid ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b> "It has been suggested that the original stock of the Susian population came from many of the surrounding villages which were abandoned as a prelude to Susa’s foundation (Pollock 1989: 283), and that the burning of at least a portion (see also Kantor and Delougaz 1996) of the site of Choga Mish may have had something to do with the foundation of Susa (Hole 1983: 321), possibly, as Hole has suggested, ‘a deliberate attempt to reestablish some kind of a center and vacate the area of the previous one’ (apud Pollock 1989: 292). Whatever the raison d’être behind Susa’s foundation, and it may have been very mundane indeed, the site’s subsequent development was soon distinguished by a number of architectural developments which would seem to exceed the scope of activities normally associated with village life (Dollfus 1985: 18-19)."

However, the basic mode of living at this time was in agricultural villages and herding camps so the urban aspect should not be exaggerated. The "Urban Revolution" was to come c3800-3000 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_IrSusa1] This was a time when centers developed to a larger scale than before[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_IrSusa1], and increased - if still incipient - centralization with the emergence of elite houses, whilst the societies as a whole maintained a "strong egalitarian appearance".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_IrSusa1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Prior to the foundation of Susa part of the existing site of Choga Mish was burned and villages surrounding Susa were abandoned, but archaeologists have not yet settled on an explanation why this occurred.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_IrSusa1] Susa, which replaced Choga Mish as the biggest settlement in the region, is noted for its comparatively great size compared to surrounding settlements with about 1000 people in the 15-18 hectare urban area, which consisted of non-contiguous groups of houses.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_IrSusa1] Hole (1987) estimates there were 10,000 people in the region of Susiana.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_IrSusa1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Despite the low population density Susa soon after its foundation became "distinguished by a number of architectural developments which would seem to exceed the scope of activities normally associated with village life".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_IrSusa1] most notably a stepped platform.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_IrSusa1] Many archaeologists are, however, reluctant to infer from the impressive temple constructions that Susa was a 'ceremonial centre' or to suggest it was politically organized as a chiefdom.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_IrSusa1] Administrative conventions and writing are known to have developed in the later Uruk period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_IrSusa1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]There is nevertheless obvious evidence of a central authority in terms of the organization and hoarding of goods. Excavations at Susa discovered may stamp seals and sealings from the Susa I period, some of which may have been used on locked doors. This implies an authority existed "to control the flow of goods in and out of one or more offices or centres of redistribution."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_IrSusa1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Earliest and latest radiocarbon 14 dates for Susa are about 4400-3900 BCE and 3700-3500 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_IrSusa1] Tepe Jaffarabad, which is analogue in terms of ceramics, has been radiocarbon dated 4100-3900 BCE and 3900-3700 BCE and "thus generally consistent with the Susa dates"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_IrSusa1] - at least for the period from 4100-3700 BCE.</div></body></html>
