Many writers see the civil war between Atawallpa and Waskhar as evidence that the Inka were incapable of governing their large empire effectively over the long term. ... Based on comparisons with other states and empires, there is no reason to believe that the Inka empire was in permanent decline in 1532."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_PeInca*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The dating of the Killke era from ad 1000 until about 1400 is still based on relatively few radiocarbon dates, but they are consistent with one another (Dwyer 1971; Kendall 1985; Bauer 1992; Adamska and Michecsynski 1996). Carbon dates taken from Pumamarca architecture end in the fourteenth century (Hollowell 1987), while the Inca-style rectangular and ceremonial constructions at Pukara Pantillijlla are also earlier than we would expect from the historical chronology (Covey 2006b: 163). In light of the early dates, Bauer (1992: 47) has ventured that some structures usually thought to belong to the imperial era were actually raised during the Killke period. As noted in chapter 2 (section entitled “Time frames”), carbon dates suggest that the transition from the pre-Inca to Inca eras at Chokepuquio seems to have occurred 1400 - 30, which is in keeping with the idea of a late incorporation of the Lucre region."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_PeInca*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"During the 14th century, the Inka state annexed new territory through increasingly protracted military campaigns. Local resistance or rebellions led to the territorial consolidation of the increasingly large parts of the Inka heartland, while long distance diplomatic contacts became more sustained and formalized."

Valcárcel (1934-5) made a major advance in understanding the early settlement through his extensive excavations in the early 1930s at that site. There, he recovered abundant ceramics, about one-quarter to one-third of which were later determined to be pre-imperial Inca (Killke style)."

Their work in and around the Qorikancha has yielded exceptionally high-quality pottery (Bauer and Covey 2004: 77-8). The planning of parts of the early town apparently foreshadowed the imperial capital’s layout. Building foundations under the present-day Hotel Libertador were found to have orientations like those of nearby imperial masonry. From that evidence, we may infer that at least part of the most prestigious imperial layout overlaid an existing design. In turn, that suggests that there was some sort of conceptual continuity from the pre-imperial to imperial eras (González Corrales 1984; Hyslop 1990: 30-4)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_PeInca*] Outside the Cuzco NGA, the Incas conquered and either assimilated these polities culturally, as with the Chimu [MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_PeInca*] or relocated groups inside these zones, as in the case of Cerro Azul [MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_PeInca*].  Farrington mentions the presence of Killke pottery in urban excavations in Cuzco [MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_PeInca*], but he explains the growth of the site in terms of a post-1438 urbanization project by Pachakutiq [MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_PeInca*].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ EsHabsb ♥</b> Spanish Empire - Viceroyalty of Peru</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Cuzco ♥</b> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_PeInca*][MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_PeInca*] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_PeInca*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The city of Cuzco is the principal one of all those where the lords of this land have their residence; it is so large and so beautiful that it would be worthy of admiration even in Spain; and it is full of the palaces of the lords, because no poor people live there, and each lord builds there his own house, and all the caciques do likewise, although the latter do not dwell there continuously."

They could exert indirect control through their hegemony over local allies. At Farfán in northern Peru, the blend of Chimú and Inka architectural styles may indicate that local elites were the vessel through which Inka rule was manifested.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_PeInca*] Over the areas they conquered by force, the Inkas established new settlements and imposed their own regional administrators. Near Cañete, they massacred the local Guarco population and installed their own colonists at the site of Cerro Azul.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_PeInca*] The dispersion and relocation of unruly people was one of their strategies to avoid uprisings, and could also serve to foster the empire's productivity. Indeed, resettled populations could be clustered to create specialized centres of production, such as the weavers and potters of Milliraya, Bolivia.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_PeInca*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In addition to these violent methods, however, the Inka elite used ideological strategies to create a sense of community among conquered populations. Inka art employed a uniform geometric style, easily recognizable throughout the empire. Apart from the fine textiles and metals crafted for the royal lineages by chosen craftspeople, the rest of their ceramics and textiles were mass-produced and mass-distributed.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_PeInca*] This meant that Inka identity could be easily replicated and grafted onto existing cultures. The Inka 'package' included ceremonial vessels known as <i>k'eros</i> and <i>aribalos</i>,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_PeInca*] used to distribute maize beer or <i>chicha</i> in state-sponsored feasts. The Inkas also reused previously important ceremonial shrines (<i>wak'as</i>) ‒ Muyu Orco, for example, was revered from the Late Formative period to the arrival of the Spanish.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_PeInca*] ‒ and incorporated them into the network of shrines (<i>z'eque</i>) radiating outwards from Cuzco.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_PeInca*] Every year, important state rituals manifested this state ideology on an impressive scale: the Inti Raymi or solstice festival was a grand state ceremony lasting for eight or nine days.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_PeInca*] Cuzco acted as a great ceremonial centre with its sacred precincts; provincial administrators could be formally installed during the course of some of these rituals.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_PeInca*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The empire is also known for its elaborate infrastructure works. The royal highway, known as Qhapaq Ñan, was composed of two north/south axes linked by 20 east/west segments, and stretched over 40,000 kilometres.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_PeInca*] Empire-sponsored storage facilities were located near every major town and village along the Inka roads. These units, known as <i>tampus</i>, were located no further than 15-25 kilometres apart,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_PeInca*] a distance that corresponds to a day's walk and facilitated the transport of armies and commodities throughout the empire. A highly efficient courier system was also in place, whereby messengers called <i>chaski</i> were stationed every 6-9 kilometres to relay messages,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_42_PeInca*] allowing information and commands to travel 250 kilometres in a day.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_43_PeInca*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Inka empire was unprecedented in the Andean region in its ambition and scale.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_44_PeInca*] Working backwards from colonial estimates, archaeologists and historians have estimated that its population in the early 16th century could have reached between 6[MAJIDBENAM_REF_45_PeInca*] and 14 million.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_46_PeInca*] The capital, Cuzco, was a thriving city of 20,000 people[MAJIDBENAM_REF_47_PeInca*] divided into two moieties, <i>hanan</i> and <i>hurin</i>, which represented both status divisions and geographical origin.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_48_PeInca*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]At the top of the religious, military and administrative hierarchy was the the emperor, the Sapa Inka. Considered to be the Son of the Sun, he was believed to control supernatural powers.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_49_PeInca*] After their deaths, Inka rulers were still venerated as mummies and their cults were managed by descendants from the same lineage.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_50_PeInca*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Inkas used a 10-tiered administrative system, with 80 provinces administered by a governor in a local urban settlement.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_51_PeInca*] They implemented a characteristic mode of production known as <i>mit'a</i> ('to take a turn').[MAJIDBENAM_REF_52_PeInca*] This built on Andean notions of reciprocal exchange to extract corvée service from heads of households for two or three months each year, ensuring that the state could rely on constant labour on a rotating basis.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The empire came to an abrupt end at the beginning of the 16th century. The Sapa Inka at this time, Huayna Khapaq, was stricken with disease ‒ possibly smallpox that had spread southwards from Central America, where it had been introduced by European invaders ‒ and died in 1528 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_53_PeInca*] His sons Waskhar and Atawallpa both claimed the throne, and the empire was soon weakened by civil war and disease. The Spanish. arrived in 1532 and conquered the Inka empire in a few years. It took several decades for them to assert their authority over the impressive geographical extent of the former Inka territory: by 1572, they had subdued the last bastion of Inka power at Vilcabamba.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_54_PeInca*] However, indigenous resistance continued until Peru obtained its independence in 1821.</div></body></html>
