The Greek and Etruscan towns experienced an increasing demand for raw materials which led them to enlarge their supply areas until they embraced a large part of the continent. In this vast exchange system, certain well-positioned local chiefs played the role of privileged intermediaries. They were able to monopolize trade and exchange, and controlled the supply of Mediterranean prestigue goods, ultimately extending their influence into neighbouring territories. They reduced local rulers to vassal status.

It coincides with the North Alpine complex, extending over modern-day central and southern Germany, northern Italy, and Switzerland.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_FrHallC][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the Hallstatt C period, which lasted from around 700 to 600 BCE,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_FrHallC] Hallstatt polities became increasingly integrated into the Mediterranean economy. Although the settlement pattern was still rather decentralized,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_FrHallC] this period saw the proliferation of fortified sites.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_FrHallC] These elevated settlements, covering between one and ten hectares, sprang up at strategic locations such as the confluence of rivers. They were often enclosed by earthworks and walls and associated with burial mounds and tumuli.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_FrHallC][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Another important development of the Hallstatt C period was an increasing diversity in material culture, especially in ceramic and metal objects, as seen in the elaborate bronze hoards dating to this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_FrHallC] The variability of artefact types may indicate the fragmentation of cultural zones and the creation of myriad princely territories with an average radius of c. 30 kilometres.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_FrHallC] It is possible that a four-tiered administrative hierarchy developed during the Hallstatt C period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_FrHallC]</div></body></html>
