Within this system there were 24 regional leaders, each with the title of ‘‘ten thousand horsemen.’’ The 24 regional leaders represent a dispersed control hierarchy, probably composed of the leaders of long-standing aristocratic lineages (e.g., Sneath 2007, p. 116)."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_MnXngnM] "Based on radiocarbon dating, the time-span of material patterns associated with Xiongnu archaeology range as early as 400/300 BC and as late as 200 AD. It is in the nature of archaeological dating to have wide error ranges but despite this, these archaeological patterns probably precede and postdate the Xiongnu chronology given in the histories (i.e., 209 BC to c. 93 AD)."

However, the Hsiung-nu vocabulary “recorded by Chinese belonged, in most cases, to the ‘upper’ functional style of the language of appropriate social formations that, probably, has not become the foregoer of the Turkic languages but, as it is typical of such functional styles, dissipated together with the society in which is functioned” (Dybo 2007: 199, 201). In either case, it should be remembered that the Xiongnu were polyethnic and polylingual nomadic empire. According to the written sources, the Xiongnu aristocracy included the Chinese counsellors and military commanders (most familiar of them is warlord Li Ling). The racial and ethnic tolerance is confirmed by the newest archaeological and genetic data (Kim et al. 2010). If, according to data of the physical anthropology, the Xiongnu of the Central and West Mongolia are close to the cultures of the Turkic circle then the Xiongnu of the East Mongolia bear many similarities to the Xiongnu of East Baikal area and Xienpi (Tumen 2011: 370)."

Between about 200 BCE and 100 CE, it was under the control of the Xiongnu Imperial Confederation.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]This polity comprised several nomadic peoples from the Mongolian Steppe. By the 4th century BCE, the Xiongnu  began raiding northern China,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_MnXngnM] where their mounted archery overwhelmed the heavily armed but relatively immobile Chinese infantry.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_MnXngnM] The nomads were held at bay by a combination of tribute in the form of metals, finished products, and agricultural products, and China's numerical superiority.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_MnXngnM][MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_MnXngnM][MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_MnXngnM] Several Chinese victories against the Xiongnu in the 1st century BCE and factional conflict within the confederacy led to the confederacy’s breakup, and a new group of semi-nomadic peoples from the Northeast, the Xianbei, took control of the region.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_MnXngnM][MAJIDBENAM_BR]At their height, the Xiongnu ruled over an area that included all of Mongolia, extending to the Ordos region in the south, and the boreal forests of Siberia in the north, for a total of about 4,000,000 squared kilometres.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_MnXngnM][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Precise estimates could not be found for the empire's population, but estimates suggest that nomads living to the north of China did not number more than 1,500,000,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_MnXngnM] and the best studied (but not the largest) settlement, Ivolga, likely had a population of between 2,500 and 3,000.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_MnXngnM] The empire was divided into three kingships: a central one, directly ruled by the paramount leader, and a "left" one and a "right" one, to the east and west, respectively, distributed among twenty-four regional leaders known as the "ten thousand horsemen".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_MnXngnM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Xiongnu Confederacy ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ XiongnuKhanate_100BCE: 100BCE-60BCE; XiongnuKhanate_200BCE: 209BCE-101BCE ♥</b>  XiongnuKhanate_100BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_MnXngnM] XiongnuKhanate_200BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_MnXngnM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  5053222: 100BCE-60BCE;  1038003: 209BCE-101BCE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Xiongnu ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Xiongnu ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Xiongnu ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Shamanism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Xiongnu Religion ♥</b></div></body></html>
