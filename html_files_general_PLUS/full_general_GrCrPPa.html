Regional centers, once secondary capitals under the Knossian control, regain a degree of independence. The regional elites exerted their authorities over the land by adopting social instruments and ideological strategies which turned out to be very similar to those used by the previous Knossian power, beginning possibly with the Linear B administration. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_GrCrPPa] Crete, to quote Popham "was free, too, of centralized control and it may be assumed that the various geographical regions, or provinces, existed independently under their local  rulers."

Kydonia (Chania), in west Crete, seems to have been a centre of significant importance during Late Minoan IIIB (1300-1200 BCE). Tablets written in Linear B script and inscribed locally produced stirrup jars used to transport aromatic oils points to a central administration. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_GrCrPPa] There is no evidence, however, to argue that Kydonia was the seat of a central political authority controlling Crete.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣Minoan; Early Greek♥</b> Most population spoke Minoan while early Greek was mostly used in administration.</div><div class='meatypart'></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b>  The linguistic family of Minoan is unknown.

Regional centers, once secondary capitals under the Knossian control, subsequently regained a degree of independence. Regional elites exerted their authorities over the land by adopting social instruments and ideological strategies which turned out to be very similar to those used by the previous Knossian power, possibly including the use of Linear B script for bureaucratic purposes.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_GrCrPPa] Things changed in the eleventh century, with the fall of the great Eastern Mediterranean powers and a resulting period of instability in both the region generally and the island specifically.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_GrCrPPa][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Firth estimated the Cretan population during Late Minoan IIIA and IIIB periods (1400-1200 BCE) at 110,000 people[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_GrCrPPa] As for political organization, the supreme leader of the state was the king (<i>wanax</i>), presided over the political, economic and religious  hierarchy, though possibly lacked military and judicial authority[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_GrCrPPa]</div></body></html>
