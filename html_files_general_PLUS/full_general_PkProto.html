Unclear. It is seems very likely that Pirak was once part of a larger assemblage of culturally similar settlements, but, perhaps due to the erosive effects of nearby rivers, only Pirak remains[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_PkProto] However, it is worth noting that this phase of Pakistan's prehistory is characterised by greater regionalisation[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_PkProto], so the scale of supra-cultural interaction is likely to be smaller compared to both preceding and succeeding polities.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ unknown ♥</b>The Kachi Plain, in modern-day Pakistan, is hemmed in on two of its three sides by the mountains of Baluchistan, while its southeastern side opens up to the Indus Valley.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_PkProto] Here, the settlement of Pirak was established not long after the beginning of the second millennium BCE, and it was continuously occupied from that time up until the sixth or seventh century BCE. Here we consider Pirak II and III, that is, the phases of Pirak's occupation that go from the end of the second millennium to the middle of the first millennium BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_PkProto] It seems very likely that Pirak was part of a larger assemblage of culturally similar settlements, but, perhaps due to the erosive effects of nearby rivers, only Pirak remains.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_PkProto] Notable archaeological finds from the site at this time include terracotta seals, horse and camel figurines, and zoomorphic game pieces, and the site's architecture and agricultural infrastructure is somewhat reminiscent of the Indus Valley Civilization.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_PkProto][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Not much appears to be known about Pirak's political organization, although the retrieval of terracotta seals[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_PkProto] suggests perhaps the existence of some form of bureaucracy.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The scholarly literature does not provide population estimates.</div></body></html>
