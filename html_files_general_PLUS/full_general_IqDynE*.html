The political and administrative crisis had forced each city to look after itself. Rather than governors appointed by the kingdom, temples acted as the real centres of local resources and activities. Indeed, temples could rely on their millenary tradition, administrative structure, prestige, and ability to motivate the population. They therefore required and obtained from the kings (probably the weakest ones) a certain degree of autonomy and various exemptions from tributes and obligations (defined with the terms kidinnu in Kassite and zakûtu in Akkadian). They also had a certain degree of self-government for the administration of justice and of the cities’ internal affairs."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_IqDynE*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Elamite Dynasty ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ elite migration ♥</b> "After the end of the dynasty of Isin, a sequence of shortlived dynasties of different and often foreign origins came to power, but their authority was not well established in the land."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_IqDynE*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ IqNAssr ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ ♥</b><b>Language</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Mesopotamian Religions ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language Genus ♣ ♥</b><b>Religion</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious Tradition ♣ Akkadian ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Family ♣ Semitic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Sect ♣ Afro-Asiatic ♥</b>There were four main settlement types during this period: the capital city of Babylon, secondary provincial cities, smaller towns, and villages.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_IqDynE*] Although the capital city was Babylon, it was the city of Kar-Marduk where the king resided, potentially as this was located in a less vulnerable area.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_IqDynE*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Although all settlements were joined under the king, political and economic crisis led to all major cities running their own affairs and so they held some level of autonomy.
