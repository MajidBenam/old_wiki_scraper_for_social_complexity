There have been over 100 sites along river banks identified with this Neolithic culture.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_CnPeili][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Archaeologists have found bone and stone tools and ceramics from the period as well as weapons including harpoons with bone points, stone spears, and arrows which suggests evidence of the use of bows during this time.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The people of the Peiligang culture hunted deer and wild boar and fished using nets. Animal husbandry was also practiced, with pigs, dogs and possibly chickens being reared.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_CnPeili] Stone tools were used for harvesting millet. Pottery that has been unearthed – some of the oldest pottery found in China - was using for cooking and food storage.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Little is known about the settlements and hierarchies during this period, but archaeologists generally agree that it was an egalitarian society with little to no political organisation and that settlements were small and self-sufficient.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_CnPeili]</div></body></html>
