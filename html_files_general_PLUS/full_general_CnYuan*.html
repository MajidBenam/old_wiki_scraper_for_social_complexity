[...] After invading, the Mongols found themselves on a more complicated religious terrain than they were used to. Their religious orientation would best be described as shamanism. This led them to an interest in Tibetan Buddhism (Lamaism) more than in the Three Teachings, yet they feared the gods sufficiently to show respect toward any religious professional who could claim to have access to esoteric knowledge. Buddhist monks and Daoist priests competed for Mongol patronage, debating each other most famously in a grand court debate in 1258, but the regime declined to support one and suppress the other, so long as adherents of each could demonstrate the value of their teaching for bringing good fortune. It may have been the effort of Chinese trying to explain the multiplicity of their traditions to the Mongols— or was it the Mongols trying to reflect their understanding back to their new subjects?—that encouraged the people of the Yuan to see an underlying unity in their systems of beliefs. The Three Teachings did not inhabit three separate categories, but rested within a single category. Sectarian adherents of the three different traditions still fought amongst themselves for state recognition and preferential treatment, but those who were less partisan in their beliefs felt free to engage eclectically, even erratically, with all the traditions."

This polity, ruling from China, was to be known as the Yuan Dynasty, and lasted from 1271 CE until its eventual demise in 1368.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_CnYuan*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Yuan Dynasty was a continuation of the Mongolian Empire. However, Genghis Khan's empire had by this time fractured into rival Khanates, including the Chagatai Khanate, the Ilkhanate, and the Golden Horde. Although the Yuan Emperor was the nominal overlord of these regions, the Khanates were effectively independent.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_CnYuan*] The Yuan's core territory covered North China, Manchuria, and the Inner Mongolian steppe,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_CnYuan*] but military campaigns saw it expand over most of China, Tibet and into Korea.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_CnYuan*] However, their attempt to conquer Japan was thwarted by a typhoon.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_CnYuan*] Eventually, internal dissensions between the various <i>ordos</i> (political units) and local rebellions dissolved the fabric of the empire and led to its disaggregation.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_CnYuan*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Yuan Empire was a sociopolitical blend of Chinese and Mongolian features. At the top of the administrative, religious and military hierarchy sat the emperor, ruling under the traditional Chinese 'Mandate of Heaven'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_CnYuan*] Kublai Khan was the embodiment of a strong central authority, but the balance he created was only maintained for about 30 years after his death before emperors started to lose internal and external control over the Yuan dominion.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_CnYuan*] Administratively, the empire was modelled on its Jin predecessor, and ruled through a variety of entities such as the Secretariat, the Military Affairs Bureau, and the Censorate.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_CnYuan*] However, it also retained Mongolian institutions, such as the <i>keshig</i> (imperial guard) and the <i>ordos</i>, which corresponded to the palace-tents, household and staff of various princes and lords.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_CnYuan*] These <i>ordos</i> acted as separate vassal states under nominal imperial control.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_CnYuan*] In terms of territorial administration, the Yuan Dynasty comprised 12 provinces.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_CnYuan*] In total, the population of Yuan China may have been between 60[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_CnYuan*] and 85 million.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_CnYuan*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Communications across the vast empire were facilitated by an elaborate postal system, described in detail by Marco Polo. There were 1,400 relay stations located every 25 to 50 kilometres along the main axes of communication, and messengers could cover up to 400 kilometres a day to relay urgent news.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_CnYuan*] Resources could be controlled by the state thanks to the use of paper currency, issued in proportion to silver reserves, and a commercial tax on the government-sponsored <i>ortoq</i> merchant class.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_CnYuan*] Another significant source of wealth was the salt monopoly, which had reached 80 percent of the government's income by 1320.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_CnYuan*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Kublai oversaw the construction of a new capital, known as Dadu to the Chinese, Khanbalik to the Turks and Daidu to the Mongols, on the site of modern Beijing.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_CnYuan*] At its height, Dadu may have had 600,000 inhabitants.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_CnYuan*] The location of this city in the vicinity of the northern frontier enabled Kublai to retain control over the Mongolian homeland.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_CnYuan*] Its architecture and design embodied the syncretism of Mongolian and Chinese influences: it featured two inner walls and an imperial city, but also had avenues wide enough for nine horsemen to gallop abreast, and Mongolian yurts flourished in its parks.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_CnYuan*] The court was cosmopolitan and although Kublai followed Tantric Buddhism, he also had Confucian advisors[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_CnYuan*] and welcomed foreigners such as the Polo family. The Yuan were patrons of education through state schools and temples; state organizations sponsored the study of Confucianism, astronomy, historiography and medicine.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_CnYuan*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Yuan China encompassed a territory that fluctuated between roughly 11 and 24 million square kilometres, supporting a population of between 60 and 85 million people.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_CnYuan*][MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_CnYuan*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Yuan ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Yuan_1300CE: 1271CE-1368CE ♥</b> Yuan_1300CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_CnYuan*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣ 12050076: 1271CE-1368CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Mongolic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Eastern Mongolic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Mongolian ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Shamanism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Mongolian Shamanism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition ♣ Buddhism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religion Family ♣ Chinese Buddhism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition2 ♣ Daoism ♥</b></div></body></html>
