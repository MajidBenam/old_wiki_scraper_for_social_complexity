The latter would eventually unit in a sort of federal system (especially in the following period). Among these various local entities, Susiana remains a unique case, due to its exposure to Mesopotamian influences."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_IrSusa3][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Uruk phase "Urban Revolution therefore led to the formation of the Early State, not just in its decisional function, which already existed in pre-urban communities, but in the fullest sense of the term. The latter is to be understood as an organisation that solidly controls and defends a given territory (and its many communities) and manages the exploitation of resources to ensure and develop the survival of its population. What distinguishes the State is the stratified, yet organically coherent, structure of the human groups constituting it. In other words, the formation of the State placed collective interests above individual ones (or of individual groups such as families, villages and so on), the former being pursued in the various functions and contributions provided by each group."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_IrSusa3][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Established in the late fourth millennium B.C., the Elamite Empire was the first Iranian experience in empire building and state tradition. ... the federated state of Elam practiced public administration ... The federal system of Elam was composed of several major kingdoms (the Kassite, the Guti, the Lullubi, Susiana, and Elamite), all being of the same racial group of the pre-Aryan people."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_IrSusa3] -- <i>Note that Potts (2016) says that the link between what has been called "Proto-Elamite" and Elamite culture does not exist, "Proto-Elamite" is a misnomer.

"The stylistic ties of the succeeding period, Susa III, are with the Banesh culture of the southern Zagros, leading Alden to suggest a second episode of migration, from Susiana into Fars, in the interval between Late Uruk and Early Susa III (Early to Middle Banesh). By that time Susa was reduced to the status of a border town, a point of linkage in trade between Mesopotamian states to the west and Proto-Elamite polities to the southeast, including hierarchically organized pastoral nomads and clusters of farming villages around towns in Izeh and central Fars."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_IrSusa3]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Susa ♥</b>  "Susa ... began its political life around 6000 BC, first as a city-state, then as an empire rivaling Sumer in Mesopotamia, and subsequently as the capital of one of the oldest empires of antiquity, Elam, around 3000 BC."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_IrSusa3]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Sumerian; Proto-Elamite ♥</b> Sumerian in neighbouring Mesopotamia: "Until Sargon, records from Akkad had been written in Sumerian."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_IrSusa3]  Proto-Elamite descendent fro Uruk IV writing and developed different signs to the Sumerian of Jemdet Nasr.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_IrSusa3] However it is also believed that during this period there was a decrease in population following a rapid urbanisation of the mountain heartland, followed by a collapse and possible reversion to nomadism. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_IrSusa3][MAJIDBENAM_BR]There were three tiers of settlement in the area: Susa, the centre and capital of the polity, the villages that surrounded Susa, and other small sites such as farmsteads or seasonal sheparding areas. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_IrSusa3] During the Susa III phase, Susa has been considered to have been the "centre of greatest economic activity in literate Iran", which led to it being annexed by Anshan. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_IrSusa3][MAJIDBENAM_BR]During this time writing developed in response to the administrative requirements of urban societies during this period. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_IrSusa3] Administration was usually run through the temples in the urban centres, which would deal with anything from dealing with trade to accounting to government duties.
