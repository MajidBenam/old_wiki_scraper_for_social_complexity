[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_EgIntOc] "However, Memphis reverted to its former administrative role for most of the Late Period (Twenty-sixth to Thirty-first Dynasties) (Jeffreys 1999: 488-90; Jones 1999: 491-3). A fortified Saite palace surmounted a 20 m high mound at Memphis, with colossal columns bearing the cartouches of King Apries. The city held a garrison, several temples, an Apis Bull embalming installation, workshops, housing for diverse ethnic groups (e.g., Egyptians, Phoenicians, Persians, Greeks), water channels, docks, and an outer fortification."

They include: 1. A renewed "quest for new religious solutions which emphasized individual salvation. Generally, people were perhaps less optimistic that a virtuous life would bring them a blessed eternity, and more reliance was placed on the gods as a source of comfort. Traditional preparations for the afterlife continued, but people were also determined to enjoy their daily pleasures while they were still alive." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_EgIntOc] 2. "Although weak and foreign dynasties tried to revive the myth of the god-king in order to support their royal status, the political power of the king continued to decline, along with his influence on religion." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_EgIntOc] 3. An "increased association between the temples and lay people. One noticeable feature was an increase in the custom of setting up personal statues inside the temples so that the owners could benefit from the regular rituals for the gods (which were the same as those performed in earlier periods), and thus receive sustenance from the divine food offerings. It also emphasized the owner's devotion to the god, and gave him a claim on the deity's attention. This tradition emphasized the fact that the gods were now regarded as better guarantors of individual postmortem protection than the age-old mortuary cults." "One of the most characteristic developments of this later period is the importance of animal cults." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_EgIntOc] 4. "One of the most characteristic developments of this later period is the importance of animal cults." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_EgIntOc] Because it doesn't seem that these changes affected most of the variables we are interested in, it seems reasonable to infer continuity with earlier periods in terms of equality, prosociality, slavery, human sacrifice, and morality. Indeed, the the first millennium BCE was characterised by a "deep-rooted revival of things past that affected many aspects of Egypt's court culture, religion, script, literature, art, architecture, and burial practices."

Forming part of the the 'Late Period' of Egyptian history, it spanned only about six decades in between phases of Persian domination.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_EgIntOc][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Twenty-eighth Dynasty was established after a number of revolts against Persian rule in 404 BCE, and Amyrtaeus II, who ruled from Memphis, may have adopted the regnal name of Psamtik (after the first Saite king) to lend his rule legitimacy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_EgIntOc] Although Amyrtaeus succeeded in extending his control as far south as Aswan in 400 BCE, where his rule was accepted by the Jewish community at Elephantine,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_EgIntOc] his reign was challenged and overthrown by one of his generals. An Aramaic papyrus at the Brooklyn museum describes a violent coup that unseated Amyrtaeus; according to the document, Nepherites I captured Amyrtaeus and executed him at Memphis.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_EgIntOc][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Nepherites I is considered the founder of a new dynasty (the Twenty-ninth). His new capital was probably at Mendes, where he carried out building projects, as revealed by excavations in the 1980s by the Brooklyn Museum and the University of New York.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_EgIntOc] Nectanebo I, founder of the Thirtieth and final native Egyptian pharaonic Dynasty, seems to have overthrown the last ruler of the Twenty-ninth Dynasty with the assistance of a Greek general called Chabrias, whose mercenaries are known to have subsequently helped prevent a Persian invasion of Egypt.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_EgIntOc][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The most powerful elements in Egyptian society in this period were members of the the warrior class and priesthood.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_EgIntOc] The men who established the Twenty-ninth and Thirtieth Dynasties ‒ Nepherites I and Nectanebo I respectively ‒ were both generals, while Amyrtaeus II was most likely the grandson of another Amyrtaeus from Sais, who had rebelled against the Achaemenid occupation.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_EgIntOc] One of the first priorities of Nectanebo II when he came to power was to control the Egyptian army; to achieve this end he promoted his oldest son to the position of 'First Generalissimo of His Majesty'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_EgIntOc] The 340s BCE were a time of insurrection, when Egyptians were fomenting rebellions against Persian authority across the eastern Mediterranean and Aegean.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_EgIntOc][MAJIDBENAM_BR]There are few sources to tell us of the workings of the Egyptian administration of this time, but historians agree that when the Persian Achaemenids conquered territories - including Egypt - they were generally happy to leave indigenous governance structures intact and did not seek to make wholesale changes to them. Egypt was made a satrapy, and the main task of the satrap in Memphis was to keep up the regular shipment of tribute to Persia.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_EgIntOc] It therefore seems likely that the Inter-Occupation Dynasties retained the administrative structures of the preceding Saite Period: a centralized court government with a warrior pharaoh and a vizier who ran his civil administration. This was the last period in which regional rulers called nomarchs formed part of the provincial administration.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Late Period of Egypt saw an elaboration of debt and credit structures, to the extent that merchants could issue loans to individuals.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_EgIntOc] Though Persian coins were used under the Achaemenids, an innovation of the post-Achaemenid period of rule was the state minting of silver coins,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_EgIntOc] perhaps from the reign of Teos onwards. Priests were required to pay a tax in silver in order to secure donations to their temples; temples were forced to drastically reduce their expenses and use the savings to make loans to the king, who used it to mint coins to pay his armies.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_EgIntOc] Pharaoh Teos evidently had enough resources to launch an attack on the Persians in the late 360s BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_EgIntOc][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Egypt at this time was a diverse, cosmopolitan state. Foreign mercenary forces recruited to defend the Egyptian homeland, a practice popular since the Third Intermediate Period, brought great ethnic and cultural diversity. The presence of garrisoned Greeks, Carians, Phoenicians, Cypriots, Aramaeans and Jews had been an important influence on Egypt since the Saite Dynasty and these groups had retained the languages and culture of their home communities.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_EgIntOc][MAJIDBENAM_BR]A significant innovation of the period was the widespread adoption of the <i>qanat</i> water supply technology, brought in by the occupying Persians in the 5th century BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_EgIntOc] Qanats were sloping subterranean tunnels that conducted groundwater over long distances, creating a reliable supply of water for drinking, bathing and irrigation.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_EgIntOc] In about 400 BCE, the Egyptian population is likely to have risen to slightly over three million.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_EgIntOc]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Egypt Inter-Occupation Dynasties ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Egypt28th_400BCE: 404BCE-342BCE ♥</b>  Egypt28th_400BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_EgIntOc]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  403292: 404BCE-342BCE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Afro-Asiatic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Egyptian-Coptic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Egyptian (Ancient) ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Ancient Egyptian Religion ♥</b></div></body></html>
