[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_IdMajap] "The end of Majapahit itself is problematic: later Javanese tradition mentions saka 1400 (1478 C.E.) as the (symbolic) "end of Majapahit." But Ranawijaya still issues inscriptions in 1486 C.E., while Pigafetta, chronicler of Ferdinand Magellan's round-the-world voyage, acknowledge the existence of Magepaher (Majapahit) in 1522 C.E. And a Mahapahit inscription of Pabanolan Pari has been alternatively read as having the year saka 1563 (1541 C.E.). The demise of Majapahit was probably gradual and nondramatic. It is very likely that with the flourishing of trade cities on the northern coast of Java (pasisir), and especially the rise of Demak as a strong Islamic sultanate, Majapahit lost its control of the sea trade routes, then became disintegrated and subsequently exited the historical stage."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_IdMajap]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ loose ♥</b> Majapahit marked a transition to a kingdom with a more powerful centre which could collect revenue and products directly from outlying and subordinate areas rather than just receiving them as tribute or ritual offering. Tax and revenue is sent to the centre, but this relationship is mediated through <i>watek</i> ruled by individuals known as <i>rakrayan</i>, many of which would have once been independent chiefdoms which retained a separate but clearly subordinate identity, though the centre remained neither brave nor powerful enough to totally strip the power of this traditional elite. As time went on, the central court increasingly dealt directly with local indigenous temples and built trade links with the villages, bypassing the <i>watek</i> and offering local temples tax exemption or <i>sima</i> in exchange for loyalty. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_IdMajap] Furthermore, the degree of centralisation increased throughout the Majapahit era -  the idea of state evolvmed from fluid Indic mandala as described in the Tuhanaru inscription of 1326, but Jawa bhûmi as conceptualised in the Nagarakërtagama. In this formulation, the state is more stable and integrated politically and economically - it is distinguished from the larger territory that was said to be "in the orbit" of the Majapahit kraton. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_IdMajap] However, the generally decentralized system also created powerful and autonomous enclaves in port areas.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_IdMajap]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Singhasari Kingdom ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ elite migration ♥</b> Following the Mongol invasion of 1293, Vijaya allied with the Mongols against the enemies of the Singhasari and established a new capital at Majapahit.
