This name cannot be used in reference to the later period, when the capital shifts to East Java. It must also be distinguished from the much later Islamic polity, the Mataram Sultanate.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_IdMedng]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Peak Date ♣ 850 CE ♥</b> The period between 732 and 918 is said to be a golden age of Javanese culture - height of temple building projects and thus the flourishing of art and architecture.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_IdMedng]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 732-1019 CE ♥</b> The definitive end of Medang seems to have come with military defeat in 1006.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_IdMedng] but it seems there was then a period of fragmentation and turmoil before Airlangga consolidated power beginning in 1019.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_IdMedng] There are two hypotheses regarding Medang. One suggests that the founder of the Sanjaya dynasty was actually founder of the Sailendra dynasty, which was initially Shivaist Hindu, and changed to Mahāyāna Buddhism on the conversion of his son Panangkaran. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_IdMedng] The other theory is that there were two competing dynasties within the same polity and the Sailendra gradually assumed dominance. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_IdMedng]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ nominal ♥</b> Political centralization hard to achieve, despite the lack of geographical barriers, due to the influence of local elites in eco-regions. The main political actors were the leaders of eco-region water boards who coordinated the planting of rice. "Kingdoms" began to form on the rice plains through alliance structures. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_IdMedng]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ alliance ♥</b> 732-800 C.E.: alliance Dharaindra (rr. 780-800) ascended to become the Maharajah of Srivijaya. The nature of the Sailendra's close relationship with the neighbouring Srivijaya empire is complex. It seems that in earlier times, the Sailendra family was within the Srivijayan mandala (sphere of influence), and that later the Sailendra's monarch rose to become the head of Srivijaya. It is uncertain as to whether this was due to a military campaign or close alliance.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_IdMedng] It seems that over the course of the ninth century, however, any alliance broke down, as in 990 Medang launched a campaign against Srivijaya, leading ultimately to the downfall of Medang in 1006.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_IdMedng]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Kalingga Kingdom ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b> Sanjaya, founder of the Medang Kingdom, was great-grandson of the famous Kalingga monarch Queen Shima.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_IdMedng] The capital was in the mid-ninth century moved to another site in Central Java, Mamrati, and then again around half a century later to Poh Pitu. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_IdMedng] When Medang moved to East Java around 929, the capital was placed firstly at Tamwlang for a very short time, and then moved to Watu Galuh. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_IdMedng] It finally moved to Wwatan.

In 732 CE, in an inscription written in Sanskrit, a local ruler called Sanjaya made the 'first definite claim to kingship' known from the region.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_IdMedng] Over the next few centuries, his successors would extend their influence over areas suitable for irrigated rice agriculture in upland central Java. The Medang Kingdom is famous for its large-scale sacred construction projects, such as the Buddhist pilgrimage site of Borobudur (a series of ascending stone terraces decorated with stone reliefs and topped with stupas) and Prambanan, a Hindu temple complex.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_IdMedng][MAJIDBENAM_BR]A long-standing debate about dynastic succession in late 1st-millennium CE central Java is still unresolved,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_IdMedng] showing that there are still many gaps in our understanding of the kingdom. Some scholars hold that there were two competing dynasties, the Buddhist Sailendras and the Shaivite descendants of King Sanjaya, while others believe that the rulers mentioned in inscriptions were two branches of the same family. In the early 10th century CE, the centre of royal power shifted from the high volcanic plains of central Java to the east of the island, signalling the increased importance of maritime trade to the polity.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_IdMedng][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]King Sanjaya and his successors drew their legitimacy from Indic religious concepts, sometimes devoting themselves to Hindu deities (especially Shiva) and sometimes favouring Buddhist practices.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_IdMedng][MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_IdMedng] They gathered courtly entourages about them and drew their wealth from the taxation of rice and other goods and the use of corvée labour.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_IdMedng] Local lords, known as <i>rakrayan</i>, and temple foundations could be granted the right to collect taxes from the population within a given parcel of land: these <i>sima</i> tax-grants were a useful way for the Medang kings to reward and ensure loyalty.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_IdMedng][MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_IdMedng][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Secure population estimates for the Medang Kingdom are lacking, but in the early 11th century CE, the East Javanese settlements of Cane, Patakan and Baru each had populations of over 1000 people.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_IdMedng] The demographer Peter McDonald believes the population of the island as a whole in the 14th century could have been as high as five million.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_IdMedng] Evidence from Javanese inscriptions suggests that by this time, the population levels of East Javanese states had been rising ‘fairly consistently’ since the early 10th century.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_IdMedng]</div></body></html>
