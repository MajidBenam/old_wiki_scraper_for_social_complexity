French spellings of some of these names are also commonly found in the literature ‒ for example, Kulibali is sometimes spelled Coulibaly and Segu is sometimes spelled Segou.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_MlBaman][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The kingdom was located in the Niger Bend, in West Africa. Between 1725 and 1751, under Biton's leadership, the Bamana of Segu conquered the whole of Bamana territory (including the Beledugu region, Jenne, and Timbuktu), and took Niani, the capital of the Mali Empire.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_MlBaman] After a series of weak successors, Ngolo Diarra (1766‒1790) strengthened the kingdom's hold over Timbuktu and Macina and conquered part of Dogon country.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_MlBaman] The Bamana Kingdom reached its greatest size under the rule of Monson Diarra (1792‒1808), who extended Segu power from San to Timbuktu, and from the Land of the Dogons to Kaarta.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_MlBaman][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and Political Organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Bamana kingdom was ruled by single leader, known as the <i>faama</i>, who also led the army and was advised by an assembly of 40 men, including warriors and holy men. This assembly was based on a pre-existing Bamana institution known as <i>fla-n-ton</i> or <i>ton</i>, that is, an association of young men who had undergone circumcision together. With exceptions like Biton Kulibali and Ngolo Diarra, it seems that most <i>faama</i> were weak and ineffectual, at the mercy of the assembly. Stronger rulers, however, were able to govern with few constraints.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_MlBaman][MAJIDBENAM_BR]It is also worth noting that slavery was an important institution in the Bamana kingdom: the trade in slaves for guns and horses lay at the heart of the power of this nascent 'warrior-state'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_MlBaman][MAJIDBENAM_BR]No official population estimates could be found for the Bamana Kingdom. However, the kingdom covered about half the territory of modern Mali, Guinea and Senegal, and the total population of these three countries in 1960 was around 12 million.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_MlBaman][MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_MlBaman][MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_MlBaman] No reference could be found to a population crash between 1800 and 1960, but demographic growth was probably slower in the 19th century than in the 20th century. The population of the Bamana Kingdom in 1800 may have numbered three or four million people.</div></body></html>
