With the decline of central leadership, control over the territory and wealth of the Ulus had fallen to them. They provided most of the military manpower of the Ulus, either from their own tribesmen or from the armies of the regions under their control. No one therefore could either become or remain leader of the Ulus wihout the backing of the tribal leaders. Tribal chiefs naturally were not eager to strengthen the position of a central leader; they were intolerant of claims to sovereignty over them,and if a leader displeased them, they were quick to switch their loyalties to a rival candidate. Under these circumstances, central leadership was often contested, sometimes even after a leader had been acclaimed by the tribes of the Ulus."

Only with the ruler Tarmashirin did Islam approach this status, but he only ruled for a handful of years in the 1330s. Overall, it seems most appropriate to code traditional Mongolian customs as the official cult, but they are rather poorly documented, and it is often difficult to distinguish more recent ones from ones that were genuinely followed in this polity. For brief but nuanced summaries of the religious situation, see the below quotes. "Chaghadai was famous as an expert in Mongol rituals and customary law (the jasaq or yasa). His erudition in ritual, especially the  re cult, made him the patron of shamans in later Mongolian folklore. His zealousness in enforcing Mongol norms (sometimes colliding with Muslim ones) earned him an anti-Islamic reputation, although Muslims often adept in magic no less than in Muslim law held important posts in his court. Despite this reputation and several cases of Muslim or Buddhist zealousness, Qaidu and most Chaghadaid khans were tolerant towards the main religions in their realm: Islam, Buddhism and Christianity. Several khans (Du'a, Eljigidei, Changshi, Yesun-Temur) favoured Buddhism, and even after his Islamization Tughluq Temur is said to have asked for a Buddhist teacher from Tibet. Mongolian documents from Turfan, most of which are Buddhist texts, suggest the popularity of Buddhism among the Mongols in this region. Buddhist monasteries were exempted from labour taxes (as was the rule in China) and sometimes also from land and sales taxes. Chaghadai himself was said to have been baptized, and several later khans (Eljigidei, Changshi) showed favour towards Christian missionaries and conducted diplomatic relations with the Pope. "Chaghadaid Islamization was a gradual process, which began in the west and moved eastwards. As in the other Mongol khanates, contact with Muslim elements, mainly in the army and among the local population, as well as Sufi missionary activity were the main stimulators of conversion, though it took longer to root Islam among the yasa-adherent Chaghadaids than among other Mongols in West Asia. Tarmashirin is credited with bringing Islam to Mongol Transoxania, and his pro-Muslim policies certainly contributed to the khanate's Muslim character, although many emirs, several princes and ephemeral khans, and rank-and-file Mongols had embraced Islam before his rise. It took a few more decades before the Sufis established Islam in Moghulistan under Tughluq Temur and his heirs." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_UzChagt] "The ulus of Chaghatay, finally, is typically described as a latecomer to Islamization, and as the Mongol successor state most resistant to the adoption of Islam - in short, as the 'least Muslim' of the three Chinggisid houses that eventually adopted Islam. There are many reasons for this characterization, some of which are historically and religiously justifiable, but there is as much justification, if not more, for recognizing the Chaghatay ulus as the most Muslim of the Mongol successor states. This should hardly be surprising, given the sheer strength of Islam in the urban and sedentary regions of the Chaghatay ulus, and given the prominence, in the Mongol administration of these regions, of native Muslims. The Mongol conquest of Central Asia, after all, was far from a religious 'clash of civilizations' as it is sometimes portrayed. Many local Muslim officials and religious figures cooperated with the Mongols, while the most obstinate opponents of the Mongols were often non-Muslim military forces garrisoned in Central Asian cities, and resented by the local Muslim population, through the imperial will of the Khwarazmshah, whose own policies - both locally, through his dispossession of local Muslim rulers, and internationally, through his challenge to the  Abbasid Caliph - were hardly those of a defender of Islam. "Islam had its defenders, however, in the long-standing centres of Islamic civilization and religious scholarship in the cities of Mawarannahr, parts of Khurasan, and the western and southern parts of the Tarim Basin, all of which were incorporated into the ulus of Chaghatay; by the thirteenth century, moreover, Muslim scholarship had reached well beyond these prominent urban centres, and we hear of jurists of this era from the town of Imil, 'at the furthest reaches of Turkistan', and from Qayaliq (Qayaligh), a town of the Ili Valley in the heart of the Chaghatayid ulus. All these regions provided a substantial Muslim constituency that could and did serve as a vector of Islamization among the nomads as well; this was particularly true in regions, such as Mawarannahr, where local geography favoured the close proximity of nomadic groups to towns and agricultural zones, fostering economic and social ties between the tribesmen and the settled Muslim population. While there were clearly regions of the ulus of Chaghatay that could support a 'purer' nomadism with disdain for the products and other appeals of sedentary culture, the notion of inveterate Chaghatayid hostility towards Islam, rooted in 'nomadic conservatism', is another of the common assumptions that ought to be abandoned.//"Even among the descendants of Chaghatay, Islam and Muslims fared well quite early on. [...] Islam did not again find a significant royal convert and patron in the Chaghatayid realm until the 1330s. [...] The last of Duwa's sons to reign, Tarmashirin, adopted Islam and sought openly to rule as a Muslim monarch (in the early 1330s)[...]. According to al-'Umari, when Tarmashirin commanded his amirs and troops to adopt Islam as he had done, there were some among them who had preceded him in becoming Muslims, and some who responded to his summons and converted; Tarmashirin was assisted, the account adds, by the imams and shaykhs of the country, who took advantage of 'the pliability of the Turk' in their proselytizing, and turned the people of Tarmashirin's realm into 'the most zealous of people in religion'. Though acknowledging that the rulers of the ulus of Chaghatay had been the most stubborn in clinging to the yasa of Chinggis Khan and to the customary rites of the Mongols, al-'Umari affirms again that both the nomadic and sedentary population of this realm had preceded their rulers in adopting Islam early on, and suffered no harm for it 'despite the unbelief of their kings'. While the first part of al-'Umari's latter comment - despite its primarily rhetorical significance, in terms of the contrast al-'Umari sought to make - has been influential in cementing the image of the Chaghatayid realm as hostile to Islam, the rest of this passage is remarkable for its express argument that Islam had spread at the 'grass-roots' level, both widely and deeply, before the 'royal conversion' of Tarmashirin.//"That such Islamization was not as overwhelming as al-'Umari hoped, especially in the eastern parts of the ulus of Chaghatay, is clear from the revolt that ousted Tarmashirin from power in 1334; he was followed by khans from the house of Chaghatay depicted as harshly hostile to Islam, and the tensions between political factions de ned in part on the basis of religious affiliation - only in part, to be sure, but a significant part in terms of mobilizing particular constituencies - may in fact help explain why the political situation in the western part of the Chaghatayid realm collapsed at precisely this point into near chaos, with powerful tribal chieftains propping up Chaghatayid princes and warring among themselves. This situation lasted, in large measure, until the consolidation of power by one such warlord, Timur, during the later 1360s and early 1370s."
