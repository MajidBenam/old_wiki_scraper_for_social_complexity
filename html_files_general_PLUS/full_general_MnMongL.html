Karakorum once again became the capital of a Mongol state, one which now ruled essentially within its own ethnic boundaries. This country, which extended from Manchuria to Kyrgyzstan between the Great Wall of China and Lake Baikal, was a relatively large entity, and its ambitions to regain sovereignty over China still caused considerable anxiety to the Ming dynasty, which had supplanted the Yüan in China.&nbsp;» [MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_MnMongL] Karakorum was then destroyed by the Ming in 1380.

The Khalkhas were themselves divided into the Northern and Southern Khalkhas, and the Northern Khalkhas were divided into left-flank and right-flank Khalkhas For much of their history, the Khalkhas fought against the neighbouring Oirat confederation, with only a few decades' truce in the first half of the seventeenth century. In 1662, conflict flared up between the left-flank and right-flank Khalkhas, but it was the Oirats' invasion under Zungharian leadership that led to the fall of the Khalkha confederacy, as it pushed the Khalkhas to request Beijing's protection, which the Chinese emperor granted in 1691, in exchange for political submission.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_MnMongL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Like other Mongol confederacies, the Khalkhas were organised in a confederacy ruled by its own ruler, who however deferred to the overarching khan. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_MnMongL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the 1630s, the Khalkhas, along with the Chahars, comprised 19,580 families;[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_MnMongL] estimating 3-8 people per family results in a figure of between 58,740 and 156,640 people, which, halved to exclude the Chahars, falls to between 30,000 and 80,000.</div></body></html>
