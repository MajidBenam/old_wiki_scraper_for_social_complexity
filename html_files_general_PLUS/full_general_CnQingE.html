The peak of Early Qing dynasty is generally defined as the period between regime of Kangxi to Qinglong[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Even during the Kangxi reign period the Manchus' military prowess was declining rapidly. As they settled into a peaceful empire, the skills of riding and shooting were hard to maintain."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_CnQingE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"China at the end of the eighteenth century was a vast, wealthy empire led by an assured and generally competent ruler. It was not well-integrated, however, making its whole actually less than the sum of its parts."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_CnQingE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Conquest was primarily about the Qianlong emperor's personal power, not the state's, and so the heights of power he attained did not continue for long after he died. With the retrospective decline of Qing power from the Qianlong emperor's peak,it seems as if the longest-ruling emperor in Chinese history took his power with him to the grave."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_CnQingE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br>Temporal bounds</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 1644-1796 CE ♥</b>[Reign Title: English Reign Title/ English Personal Name (Chinese Reign Title/ Chinese Personal Name/ Chinese Temple name)]1644 CE- 1661 CE: Shunzhi/Fulin Emperor (順治/福臨/清世祖)1662 CE - 1722 CE: Kangxi/Xuanye Emperor (康熙/玄燁/清聖祖)1723 CE - 1735 CE: Yongzheng/Yinzhen Emperor (雍正/胤禛/清世宗)1736 CE - 1795 CE: Qinglong/Hongli Emperor (乾隆/弘曆/清高宗)1796 CE- 1820 CE: Jiaqing/Yongyan Emperor (嘉慶/顒琰/清仁宗)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The Qianlong emperor ruled for the longest period in Chinese history. He "retired" as emperor in 1796 so as officially not to exceed the length of his grandfather's 61-year reign, but continued to rule in fact until his death in 1799."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_CnQingE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"In the 1580s power began to shift among the Jurchen tribes, moving away from confederation under the leadership of the chieftain sanctioned by the Ming. A Ming force intervened to attack that chieftain's rival and restore the status quo, in the process also killing a father and son of the Aisin Gioro lieage. The Ming recognized Nurhaci, the eldest male orphan of the son, as the legitimate inheritor of his father's title. Nurhaci immediately set out to revenge himself upon the man who had advised the Ming commander to intervene, effecting his death three years later and establishing himself as a successful leader. In 1589 the Ming officially designated him comander-in-chief of the Yalu region, acknowledging his actual strength. His rise to power did no go unchallenged. A two-year conflict with other Jurchen tribes concluded with Nurhaci's decisive victory at Jaka on the Hun River in 1593. After allying with the Western Mongols, he destroyed or incorporated most of the remaining Jurchen tribes over a 20-year-period."

The founders of the Qing were descendants of Jurchen Jin rulers. The dynasty was founded by Nurhaci and then led by his son Huang Taiji, but did not become an imperial Chinese dynasty until after Huang Taiji's death.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_CnQingE] In 1644 CE, Qing forces captured the Ming capital at Beijing from rebels and held a funeral for the last Ming emperor to symbolize Qing inheritance of the Mandate of Heaven.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_CnQingE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Qing faced conflict with rebels and loyalist Ming forces for the next two decades.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_CnQingE] Ming generals who surrendered were given power over large territories in southern China in exchange for loyalty to the Qing. In 1673 CE, leaders from three major southern feudatories led by Wu Sangui rebelled against Emperor Kangxi when he tried to reduce their power.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_CnQingE] The Revolt of the Three Feudatories, as this episode is known, lasted eight years.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]We divide the Qing Dynasty into two, an Early period (1644-1796 CE) and a Late period (1796-1912 CE). The division is marked by a period of internal turmoil as well as foreign incursions into its territory and economic sphere. In the Early Qing period, China had been prosperous under Kangxi and Qing rule, but by the time of the Opium Wars in the Late Qing, Western technology and industry had surpassed that of China.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_CnQingE] The fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1911 gave rise to the Republic of China.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Qing ruled over an expansive empire, and its bureaucracy was more efficient than that of previous periods.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_CnQingE] Qing rulers adopted the Chinese bureaucratic system first used in the Han and Tang Dynasties.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_CnQingE] Before conquering the Ming, the Qing managed its population through a system of hereditary military organizations called the Eight Banners.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_CnQingE] These became part of the administrative structure of the Qing Dynasty and were only open to those of Manchu descent.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_CnQingE] In the later Qing period, however, the Eight Banners lost some of their political functions and served to enhance the prestige of the top Qing nobility.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_CnQingE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The central government was headed by the emperor and included a 'Grand Council', created by the Yongzheng emperor and expanded by the Qianlong emperor.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_CnQingE] The Grand Council ruled over the central ministries and provided a way for the emperor to circumvent the official bureaucracy for many decisions.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_CnQingE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Qing provincial government consisted of governors who controlled a hierarchical system of officials, prefects, county chiefs, country magistrates, and clerks.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_CnQingE] In the early Qing years, provinces were ruled by high ranking officials who were typically of Manchu descent.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_CnQingE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The territory of the Qing empire was more than double that of the Ming.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_CnQingE] Tibetans, Uighurs, Muslims, a number of Mongol groups, Burmese, Thais, and indigenous Taiwanese were incorporated into the Chinese empire.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_CnQingE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Three Qing emperors - Kangxi (1662-1722 CE), Yongzheng (1723-1735 CE), and Qianlong (1736-1795 CE) - are historically known as great rulers. During their reigns, China was extremely prosperous.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_CnQingE] Qianlong is famous for leading ten military expeditions, including campaigns in Taiwan, Burma, Vietnam and Nepal.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_CnQingE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Based on Chinese census and registration counts, the population of China in 1749 CE was about 177.5 million.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_CnQingE] The following century was one of extremely rapid population growth, and by 1851 the population had reached 431.9 million people.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_CnQingE] Historian James Z. Gao writes that the area within the Qing court's 'sphere of influence' at its peak was 13.1 million square kilometres'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_CnQingE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]While the Qing period is not well known for poetry, painting and porcelain as previous periods are, print journalism, theatre and novels flourished under the Qing emperors.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_CnQingE]</div></body></html>
