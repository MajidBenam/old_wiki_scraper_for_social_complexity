It is unclear whether it was still used during the Mermnad dynasty. The first king of the Mermnad dynasty was called "Gyges of the Luddi" in the Assyrian records of Assurbanipal.

Several campaigns during the previous reign of Alyattes and again during the reign of Croesus led to the expansion of Lydia. The Eastern border stretched to the Halys river in Central Anatolia, where eventually a peace treaty was acknowledge between the Lydians in the west and the Medians in the east. Perhaps Croesus' most significant contribution was to require that annual tribute be extracted from conquered states to the west, thus turning Lydia into an Empire. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_TrLydia][MAJIDBENAM_BR]It became a powerful force in Anatolia during the Mermnad dynasty, where it expanded it's control to the majority of western Anatolia. A number of Mermnad kings also attacked Greek states, but Lydia never maintained control of Greek lands for long.

In some areas control was strongly in the hands of the kings, for example, Alyattes appointed his son Croesus as governor of Adramyttetion, northwest of Lydia, when Cimmerians were causing trouble there. However, in the form of an Empire, much of Lydia's control was carried out throught the enforcement of annnual tribute. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_TrLydia]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ personal union; alliance ♥</b> Lydia frequently utilised marriage as a form of peace treaty. When Alyattes expanded Lydia to the East, he met a Median army expanding their territory from Susiana. An indicisive battle was fought and a truce was declared with the Halys river as the border between the two empires. To seal the deal Alyattes' daughter was married to the son of Cyaxeres, the Median king. Alyattes himself married Ionian and Carian women and married another daught to the tyrant of Ephesus.

By 650 BCE, the region of Asia Minor was integrated into a Mediterranean wide zone which had further increased in size (coast of southern France, more of the Libyan coast and northern Adriatic) by 500 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_TrLydia] "Much of what tied this world together remained commercial transactions. Except in Levantine waters, the later 7th and 6th centuries saw a further burgeoning of trade, and the final realization of a Mediterranean-wide market, already partly interdependent and governed by the regime of cheap martime transport costs, specialist production and extensive importation"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_TrLydia]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Sardis ♥</b> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_TrLydia] Sardis.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_TrLydia]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Lydian ♥</b> There are two schools of thought about the origins of the Lydian language. One suggests that it arose in north-western Anatolia and its speakers entered and settled Lydia sometime after the 12th century CBE, before written Lydia arose in 7th century CBE. Other scholars suggest that Lydia was the language of the Bronze Age including the first settlers of Sardis and other urban centres of the time.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_TrLydia] "The Phygians, then, constituted a new linguistic stratum, while the Lydians, Lycians and Carians were more or less linked to the Luwian populations of the second millennium BC."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_TrLydia] "The Lydian language, most probably, was a mix of Hittite and Luwian."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_TrLydia]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Genus ♣ Lydian Religions ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Genus ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion ♣ ♥</b>One of a number of small kingdoms in Anatolia, the Kingdom of Lydia under the Mermnad dynasty (670-546 BCE), which began with the rule of king Gyges and ended with Croesus in the 540s BCE, came to dominate Anatolia after the conquest of Phrygia. Blessed with a rich supply of minable electrum, the natural alloy of silver and gold, Lydia is most famous for being the likely birthplace of coinage.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_TrLydia][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Like Phrygia archaeologists lack detailed understanding of Lydian government but they believe the rulers ruled from a Palace citadel above the capital Sardis. Some areas under Lydian control were directly ruled through appointments made by the kings: for example, Alyattes appointed his son Croesus as governor of Adramyttetion, northwest of Lydia, when Cimmerians were causing trouble there. However, the Greek city states attacked by Mermnad kings, whom were required to pay tribute, were generally never under Lydian control for long.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_TrLydia][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The 650 BCE and 500 BCE period was characterized by the expansion of an integrated Mediterranean trading zone[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_TrLydia] and it seems that pragmatic deal-making to preserve this economic system often characterized Lydian relations with other states.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The most immediate threat appears to have been the nomadic Cimmerians who initially were expelled[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_TrLydia] which at times lead to an alliance with Assyria[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_TrLydia] which also became an enemy that required an alliance with Egypt.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_TrLydia][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Lydia kings often utilised marriages to secure alliances with many foreign powers, including the Persian Medians as well as Greek Ionians and Carians and the tyrant of Ephesus.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_TrLydia]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Lydian Kingdom ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Lydia_600BCE: 670BCE-546BCE ♥</b>  Lydia_600BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_TrLydia]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  267507: 670BCE-546BCE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Anatolian ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Lydian ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Ancient Anatolian Religion ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Phrygian Religion ♥</b></div></body></html>
