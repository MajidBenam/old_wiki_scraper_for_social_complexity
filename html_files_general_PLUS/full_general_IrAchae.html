In 550 BCE, Cyrus rose up against his despotic grandfather and overthrew him. From a contemporary document known as the Nabunaid Chronicle and the testimony of Herodotus we learn that, dissatisfied with Astyages, the Media aristocracy, led by a military commander named Harpagus, joined Cyrus and accepted him as the legitimate heir to the throne. This established the Achaemenid - of the first Persian - Empire, in which the Medes shared the status of ruling people with the Persians, so much so indeed that the Greeks frequently called the Persians 'Medes' and coined the term 'Medizing' to denote 'pro-Persian policy' or 'Persian partisan'."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_IrAchae]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ unitary state; confederate state ♥</b>Loose federation with irregular taxation under Cyrus and Cambyses with automomous satrapies.

Before Darius trade was in barter or Lydian gold coins. Satraps could coin money but only King of Kings could coin in gold.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_IrAchae] Darius I developed a national script (Old Persian cuneiform)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_IrAchae] but seems to have been ceremonial and used by Persians, in satraps local languages used.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Prior to the Parthians, political systems in Southwest Asia were for the most part relatively loose confederations in which central government ruled their 'empires' through unstable alliances with vassals and satraps. Even Hammurabi, Darius, and Alexander were only temporarily successful in linking their centralized governments to local administrative institutions, particularly outside of the core areas of Greater Mesopotamia."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_IrAchae]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Median Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b> Between 553 and 550 BCE, Cyrus the Great rebelled against Median control and re-established the independence of Persia.

From 553 to 550 BCE, Cyrus led his fellow Persians against Median hegemony (even though the Medes were ruled by his own relatives), establishing the Persians as the dominant group in Iran. His kingdom became known as the Achaemenid Empire after the legendary first King of Persia, Achaemenes, claimed to be an ancestor of the Great Cyrus himself (Achaemenid essentially translates to 'children of Achaemenes').[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_IrAchae][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Capitalizing on these early victories, Cyrus II the Great continued his military domination, conquering the wealthy Lydian Kingdom in modern-day Turkey along with most of Asia Minor and the Neo-Babylonian Kingdom in Mesopotamia, as well as consolidating Persia's hold over much of central Asia as far as modern Pakistan. His son and heir, Cambyses II, continued this tradition, expanding Achaemenid rule into the large and wealthy kingdom of Egypt. After Cambyses II's death in 522 BCE, a noble Persian named Darius came to power after overthrowing an alleged usurper to the throne (Gautama, supposedly posing as Cyrus II's son Bardiya, more commonly known by his Greek name Smerdis).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_IrAchae] Darius I, who also took the title of 'the Great', was a powerful ruler who inaugurated several military, administrative, and economic reforms,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_IrAchae] though is most well known for leading the Persian army to defeat at the hands of a coalition of small Greek city-states during the famous Persian Wars of the early 5th century BCE. Despite the fact that Darius' son and heir Xerxes I (the Great) also failed to conquer the Greek Aegean and lost a decisive battle to the same outnumbered coalition of Greeks, the Achaemenid Empire remained intact.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_IrAchae][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In 330 BCE, Darius III became the twelfth and final emperor in the Achaemenid line when he succumbed to the conquests of Alexander the Great and his invading Macedonian army (twelfth not including the alleged usurper Bardiya/Smerdis nor the short-lived Artaxerxes V, who declared himself emperor for a brief moment after Darius III was killed as Alexander was completing his conquest).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_IrAchae] Alexander became the ruler of all the territory formerly held by the Persians, incorporating it into the massive, though short-lived, Macedonian Empire and bringing an end to the great Persian Achaemenid Empire.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Achaemenid Empire was one of the largest empires in the pre-modern world, stretching nearly 6 million square kilometres across the Near East, Central Asia, the Indus Valley, Middle East, and into Egypt at its greatest extent.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_IrAchae] It was a massive, multi-ethnic society made up of Medes, Persians, Lydians, Greeks, Egyptians, Babylonians, Bactrians, Sogdians, and numerous other cultural-ethnic groups; indeed, Old Persian, Elamite, Babylonian, Aramaic, hieroglyphic Egyptian, and Greek were all used in royal and provincial communication.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_IrAchae] Between the Great rulers Cyrus II, Cambyses II, and Darius I, the Persians had stitched together an empire out of the centres of the oldest civilizations from Anatolia to Egypt, Mesopotamia and the Indus valley. Persepolis and the grand Pasargadae were large ceremonial and ritual centres in the heartland of Persia, while Susa in western Iran was the major administrative capital. At its peak under Darius I, the empire covered a huge swathe of diverse territory from the eastern Mediterranean all the way to the Indus Valley, incorporating navigable seas and rivers, protected ports and fertile agricultural land as well as rough mountainous passes. This territory held a population of between 17 and 35 million people.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_IrAchae]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Persian Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Persian_500BCE: 550BCE-401BCE; Persian_400BCE: 400BCE-331BCE ♥</b>  Persian_400BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_IrAchae] Persian_500BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_IrAchae]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  5626366: 550BCE-401BCE;  4557320: 400BCE-331BCE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Indo-Iranian ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Old Persian ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Zoroastrianism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition ♣ Judaism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition2 ♣ Ancient Mesopotamian Religion ♥</b></div></body></html>
