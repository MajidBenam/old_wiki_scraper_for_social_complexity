While there are disputes as to the details, most experts commonly agree that the fortified city of Vijayanagar was established in 1336[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_InVijay][MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_InVijay][MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_InVijay]. Prior to that, there were incursions of soldiers serving the Khalji sultans of Delhi, which allegedly created the reasons and conditions for the new dynasty and city of Vijayanagara [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_InVijay].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]As a result of repeated invasions from Muslim states to the North and civil wars within, Vijayanagara authority was fragmented in the seventeenth century[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_InVijay], leading to an imperial collapse[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_InVijay]. In 1646, the Vijaynagar empire is finally conquered by the sultanates of Bijapur and Golconda. Many of the empire's largest vassal states immediately declare independence, so the territorial gains made by the sultanates are limited. Those vassals, Mysore, Keladi Nayaka, and the Nayaks and Nayakas of Chitradurga, Gingee, Madurai, and Tanjore, all become powerful states in southern India [MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_InVijay].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ loose; confederated state; nominal ♥</b> loose: 1336-1509; confederated state: 1509-1565; nominal: 1565-1646While there is some debate over whether to define the relations between local lordships and the Vijayanagara kings as feudal or other, but there is no doubt that the degree of centralization differed during various periods of the kingdom.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The early Vijayanagara kingdom was more a group of semi-autonomous states rather than a unified kingdom. Centralized authority was enhanced by the occasional appointment of non-kinsmen, including Brahmans, to important military commands, and even to governorships of one of the five core provinces in the center of the kingdom. But this was not the usual policy; most often sons of the king ruled for him[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_InVijay].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Through most of the first dynasty, Vijayanagara kings were content to be conquerors whose conquests left the ancient Cholas and Panyas in their sovereign places, except that they were reduced by their homage to Vijayanagara. Until the early sixteenth century, the latter were ritual sovereigns everywhere outside their Deccan heartland; apart from occasional plundering forays, they were content with the homage of distant lords[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_InVijay]. Krishnadevaraya (reigned 1509-29[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_InVijay]) changed much of this. He replaced earlier royal predecessors by his own Brahmans and military commanders and charged his agents to extract money tribute from subordinate lords who had previously been required to pay nothing to Vijayanagara, merely to acknowledge the latter's hegemony in a number of symbolic ways[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_InVijay].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Krishnadevaraya cast aside the ancient the ancient Chola and Pandya kings in the South and installed military commanders who not long after established centers of sovereignty opposed to its successors[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_InVijay].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]After the catastrophic sack of the capital of Vijayanagara in 1565, the kingdom saw a big decline in power, and a series of civil wars[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_InVijay]. It was also during this time that the 'Nayaka kingdoms', which had emerged at the very zenith of the Vijayanagara monarchy (during the early 16th century; e.g. Mysore and Ikkeri), became increasingly independent and sought to avert the re-emergence of a strong Vijayanagara king capable of reducing their authority and territorial ambitions[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_InVijay]. Thus, the level of the centralization of the kingdom post-1565 should be defined as 'nominal'.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥</b> Independent polity.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Delhi Sultanate ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ cultural assimilation ♥</b> The origins of the first rulers of Vijayanagara are obscure and much debated, but it is clear that they were effective and creative military leaders who, after establishing their capital on the southern banks of the Tungabhadra River, rapidly expanded their territories to the south and resisted challenges from the north[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_InVijay].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Mughal Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Vijayanagara; Penukonda; Chandraigiri ♥</b> Vijayanagara: 1336-1565, Penukonda, Chandraigiri.
