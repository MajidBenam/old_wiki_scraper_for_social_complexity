The economy boomed, a treaty was negotiated with the Mamluks and Persia looked forward to peace and prosperity."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_IrIlkhn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Ilkhanate "fell without in any real sense having previously declined. Why was this? ... The crucial reason is a simple one: Abu Said left no heir. ... the direct line of Hulegu had failed. ... None was able to gain control of the whole Ilkanate legacy. Of the factions the most notable, ultimately, were the Jalayirids, who built up a strong position in Iraq and Azabaijan which survived into the fifteenth century."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_IrIlkhn]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 1256-1339 CE ♥</b>Beginning 1256 CE. "By 1256, Hülegü [the Mongol commander] had all but eliminated the Ismāʿilis as an independent force in Persia (although individual forts remained independent for some time, even years), and had moved with the bulk of his army to Azerbaijan, which was to become the center of the Il-khanid state."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_IrIlkhn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]End 1335 CE. The Ilkhanate came to an end with the death of Abu Sa'id in 1335 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_IrIlkhn] Dynastic failure: the Ilkhanate "fell without in any real sense having previously declined. Why was this? ... The crucial reason is a simple one: Abu Said left no heir. ... the direct line of Hulegu had failed."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_IrIlkhn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Actually the 1335 dates seems to be an over simplification. The actual end seems to be 1339 CE when Iran was divided into the four kingdoms: "who then set up another puppet, Sulayman Khan, a descendant of Hulagu, and gave him Sati Beg in marriage, while Hasan 'the Greater' set up as a rival a descendant of Abaqa named Shah Jahan Timur. A battle took place ... 1340 ... Hasan 'the Greater' was defeated ... deposed his puppet ... proclaiming himself king founded the dynasty ... of the Jala'irs, who reigned until 1411 over Western Persia and Mesopotamia with Baghdad as their capital. As for Hasan 'the Less,' ... he was murdered in 1343, while marching to attack his rival, by his wife ... The Mongol ascendancy in Persia was now at an end, and, until Timur's hordes swept over the country (1384-1393), it was divided into at least four kingdoms, those of the Jala'irs, the Muzaffaris, the Kurts, and the Sar-ba-dars..."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_IrIlkhn]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ unitary state ♥</b> Ḡāzān had princes removed from power.

This “conversion” certainly fueled the enmity of the Mamluks, and perhaps Öljeytü’s adoption of this faith was indirectly influenced by this ongoing conflict. Some Mamluk sources report that Öljeytü renounced his Shiʿite faith towards his death, but this is probably no more than wishful thinking on their (and their patrons’) part."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_IrIlkhn]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Genus ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion ♣ ♥</b>Great map of Ilkhanate Celeste (2016) available online.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_IrIlkhn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>The Mongol Empire, showing its subdivisions of the Golden Horde (yellow), the Chagatai Khanate (gray), Great Yuan (green) and the Ilkhanate (purple), c. 1300.

Source: wiki commons </i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Ilkhanate was a state that began under Mongol commander Hulegu who founded the House of Hulegu.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_IrIlkhn] The nearly eighty years the dynasty lasted was a time of general economic prosperity for the 5 million inhabitants of Persia. The end of the Ilkhanate came when Abu Said, who it is said "ruled during what was described as the 'best period of the domination of the Mongols".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_IrIlkhn], died without an heir, which resulted in the Jalayirids becoming the strongest faction in the region.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_IrIlkhn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Mongol invaders assimilated to the local culture in Persia. They converted to Islam, used the local languages (Persian and Arabic), and maintained existing Persian administrative practices, the financing of which was underpinned by iqta land grants awarded to senior bureaucrats and army officers.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_IrIlkhn][MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_IrIlkhn] According to the Persian historian Rashid al-Din, who was chief minister to Ghazan[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_IrIlkhn], the Mongols assessed the vizier (chief of the bureaucracy) on his ability to extract revenue.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_IrIlkhn] Even so, previously better known in the region as barbarians bent on destruction, the Mongols rebuilt many hospitals, mosques, and observatories, and impressive mausoleums to the rulers appeared in the cities.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_IrIlkhn][MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_IrIlkhn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]During this period, Sultaniya was a famous commercial center and after the intense building activities of Oljetu (r.1304-1316 CE) the 'great city' became the capital.
