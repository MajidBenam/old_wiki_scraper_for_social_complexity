And they were non-coercive settlements. Groups congregated by choice. This is an instance of transformation from a rural to an urban society that did not establish a hierarchical society and coercive centralized control... The process in the delta and at Jenne-jeno in particular, was one of 'complexification' rather than centralization."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_MlJeJe3]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Jenne-jeno II ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuation ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Jenne-Jeno IV ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ Jenne Culture ♥</b> Earlier coded as Sahel Tell Culture.

It was continuously inhabited between 250 BCE and 1400 CE. 'Jenne-jeno III' refers to the period from 400 to 900 CE. This roughly corresponds to the region's 'urban prosperity' phase.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_MlJeJe3] Though subsistence strategies remained largely unchanged, a number of important transformations occurred: the inhabitants of Jenne-jeno grew in number, established long-distance trade networks, and developed more sophisticated metalworking techniques.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_MlJeJe3][MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_MlJeJe3][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Between 400 and 800 CE, Jenne-jeno grew from 25 to 33 hectares. Population density was likely high, and a conservative estimate puts the population of Jenne-jeno and its satellites within a one-kilometre radius at 10,000-26,000 people around 800 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_MlJeJe3][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The political organization of Jenne-jeno may have been quite different from that of other ancient cities. In several decades of excavation, clear evidence for hierarchies of any kind has yet to be unearthed: it seems that Jenne-jeno had no palaces, rich tombs, temples, public buildings, or monumental architecture. Indeed, the city's very layout ‒ an assemblage of dispersed clusters ‒ suggests a resistance to centralization.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_MlJeJe3] It is possible that, at this time, Niger Inland Delta society was organized 'heterarchically' rather than hierarchically: that is, it was divided into multiple components, each deriving authority from separate or overlapping sources, with mechanisms in place to prevent any one group from monopolizing power.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_MlJeJe3]</div></body></html>
