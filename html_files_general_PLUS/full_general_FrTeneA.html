[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_FrTeneA] The origin of the term Keltoi may be from the Celtic peoples themselves. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_FrTeneA] Galli "was used by the Romans from the beginning of the 4th century BC to describe the Celts who invaded Italy, and later those who lived beyond the Alps in present day France."

However, after 400 CE there were no large towns on the scale of the Early Iron Age settlements. Small communities predominated, hamlets and farmsteads typically had a population of about 50.
