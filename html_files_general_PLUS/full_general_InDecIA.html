NOTE: This map is a placeholder only.</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The South Indian Iron Age lasted, roughly, from 1200 to 300 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_InDecIA] The vast majority of Iron Age megalithic structures and associated sites have been found in the modern-day Indian states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_InDecIA] As in the preceding Neolithic period, South Indians sustained themselves through bovine and caprine pastoralism as well as the cultivation of millet and pulses - and, increasingly, wheat, barley, and rice. Settlement designs became more complex and labour-intensive, and new social arrangements and mortuary practices emerged.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_InDecIA][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Differences in the scale, design and materials of mortuary megalithic structures and associated grave goods point to the growing hierarchization of South Indian societies at this time.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_InDecIA] However, there was some variation in terms of the sociopolitical organization of individual communities: for example, it is likely that some chiefs with limited decision-making powers ruled over single settlements, and that more powerful leaders based in large centres exerted some control over surrounding settlements, and that some polities were made up of several settlements ruled by a hierarchy of leaders who answered to a single paramount chief. The first type of polity probably prevailed at the beginning of the Iron Age, while the second and third type likely became more common towards its end.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_InDecIA][MAJIDBENAM_BR]No population estimates for this period could be found in the specialist literature.</div></body></html>
