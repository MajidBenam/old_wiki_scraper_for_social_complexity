It transformed a centralized, rich, stable and far-flung empire into a struggling, insecure and divided one." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_CnTangL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"In a long and costly campaign the T'ang succeeded in crushing the rebellion by 763. An Lu-shan himself had been killed earlier, in 757, by his own son. The son was, in turn, slain by Shih Ssu-ming who was then commander of all the rebel armies. Shih Ssu-ming, whose military ability was undoubted, suffered an identical fate and was subsequently murdered by his own son. Although ultimately defeated, the An Lu-shan rebellion revealed fully all the inherent weaknesses of the T'ang government. In effect, it broke its power, and while the dynasty lasted almost another century and a half it never recovered fully, in spite of the attempts made by some of the subsequent T'ang rulers, as for example Emperor Hsien-tsung (806-820), to restore a strong, centralized monarchy." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_CnTangL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Toward the end of the dynasty "effective control passed to regional states formed from the independent provinces. When one of these, the Liang, usurped the throne, the dynasty came to an end."

The T'ang provinces, 785"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_CnTangL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Tang Dynasty is widely considered a cultural and political high point of imperial China. The dynasty was founded by Li Yuan, the Duke of Tang, when the threat of insurrection forced the previous Sui dynasty court to flee from Luoyang, the capital, to Yangzhou. Li Yuan marched to Luoyang and seized the abandoned capital in 618 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_CnTangL] He became the first emperor of the Tang dynasty (r. 618-626 CE) and is posthumously known as Gaozu. Under the Early Tang Dynasty, the capital was moved from Chang'an to Luoyang.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_CnTangL] We divide the Dynasty into an Early period (618-763 CE) and Late period (763-907 CE), separated by the decline in imperial authority and instability of experienced by the Tang in the 750s, culminating in the An Lushan rebellion to close out the Early period (755‒763 CE).[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Tang Dynasty continued to rule China after the defeat of the An Lushan rebellion (755‒763 CE).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_CnTangL] However, the government never fully recovered from its impact.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_CnTangL] Tang border defences were devastated, leading to attacks from outsiders and pirates. The Tang government maintained an often-uneasy alliance with the Uighurs against the Tibetans.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_CnTangL] In 790, Tibetan forces occupied Chinese land in eastern Turkestan and ended Chinese rule in the region for almost a thousand years.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_CnTangL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_CnTangL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Late Tang China was marked by conflict, with the occasional brief period of peace. Emperor Xianzong's campaigns against rebel governors in the early 9th century restored almost all of China back to direct rule under the Tang government.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_CnTangL] Xianzong was successful in restoring stability to the Tang Empire and his death was followed by 40 years of peace.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_CnTangL] Later, Emperor Wuzong persecuted Buddhists and adherents of other non-indigenous religions. His movement reached its height in 845 CE and most monasteries were destroyed, but his successors reversed his anti-Buddhist policies.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_CnTangL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The dynasty fell in 881 CE after a series of internal rebellions, leading to about a century characterized by the rise of powerful warlords in the south and political turmoil in the north[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_CnTangL] before another period of Chinese efflorescence under the Northern Song Dynasty.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_CnTangL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Late Tang Dynasty was marked by tensions between the central government and military garrisons.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_CnTangL] In 763 CE, two-thirds of the provincial governors were military commanders.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_CnTangL] Tang emperors attempted to weaken the central bureaucracy by having military governors pay direct tribute instead of taxes.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_CnTangL] The Tang government implemented the two-tax system in 780 CE, which replaced the 'equal land' distribution system of the Early Tang.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_CnTangL] This system of taxation represented an attempt to weaken military garrison governments and to divert taxation income to the central government.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_CnTangL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Late Tang central government was marked by the rise of eunuchs. Eunuchs did not hold powerful positions in the Early Tang government, but in the later period the Department of the Inner Palace, staffed by eunuchs, became a powerful governmental authority ‒ more powerful than the emperor's chief ministers.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_CnTangL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Because the dynasty was marked by almost constant conflict, the population of Late Tang China is difficult to estimate. In 766 CE there were between 40 million and 55 million citizens,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_CnTangL] and in 900 CE there were between 60 million and 80 million.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_CnTangL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Tang Dynasty ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Tang_800CE: 763CE-899CE; Tang_900CE: 900CE-907CE ♥</b>  Tang_800CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_CnTangL] Tang_900CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_CnTangL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  3160315: 763CE-899CE;  3292823: 900CE-907CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Sino-Tibetan ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Sinitic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Old Chinese ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Buddhism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Chinese Buddhism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition ♣ Daoism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition2 ♣ Confucianism ♥</b></div></body></html>
