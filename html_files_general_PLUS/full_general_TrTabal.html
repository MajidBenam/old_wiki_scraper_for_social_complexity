A regional designator rather than a political one, Tabal encompassed a number of city-states, whose porous, shifting borders no doubt made the generalization expedient."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_TrTabal] "Beyond the Taurus there was Tabal, a confederation of minor kingdoms, which at times managed to gain independence. All these states were concentrated in the valleys and the plains between the mountains, and were separated from each other by the Taurus Mountains. Therefore, the states were located in key positions, allowing control over cultivated areas, the necessary routes for communication, and access to those natural resources necessary for the manufacture of iron."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_TrTabal] "Tabal is employed as a blanket designation in an Assyrian administrative note written sometime between 743 and 738 BC, which lists the tribute payments of nine kings of Tabal"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_TrTabal]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternative names ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Peak Date ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 900-730 BCE ♥</b>ruling line possibly dates to mid-9th century BCE but could be earlier [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_TrTabal][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Northern Tabal: probably an Assyrian tributary from 837 BCE?? until 730 BCE when Tiglath-Pileser deposed and replaced king Wasusarma.

However, by the middle of the following century, many of the states were apparently consolidated into a small number of larger kingdoms." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_TrTabal][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"from the time written records begin for the individual states that lay within the land called Hatti in Iron Age texts, it is clear that there was no sense of these states constituting a single political entity, or any form of political federation. Each was entirely independent from the others, each had its own autonomous ruler."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_TrTabal]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ nominal allegiance; alliance ♥</b>mid-9th century BCE Assyrian records suggest Tabal "consisted of a number of small independent states (which may have evolved several centuries earlier) whose rulers became tributaries of Assyria.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_TrTabal][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser III lists five kingdoms of Tabal "among his tributaries": Tabal ('Proper') ...

Shinuhtu's ruler at that time was a man called Kiyakiya (Assyrian Kiakki)."  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_TrTabal][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"...generally speaking, local rulers were free to rule their states in whatever manner they wished, without interference from the Assyrian king, unless they took actions which were prejudicial to Assyrian interests, such as participation in an anti-Assyrian alliance with other rulers."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_TrTabal][MAJIDBENAM_BR]alliances negotiated between Neo-Hittite kingdoms against one another and against the Assyrians [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_TrTabal][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"What precisely was the nature of Assyrian authority in the west as a consequence of Shalmaneser's many campaigns there? At this stage, direct Assyrian rule over the local kingdoms had not yet been established. It would be another century or so before these kingdoms were absorbed into the Assyrian provincial system. By and large, the imposition of Assyrian authority over the local states meant that their kings accepted tributary status and made regular payments, in one form or another, into the Assyrian royal coffers, and (or else) conceded the Assyrians access to resource-rich regions, particularly the forested areas of the Levantine and northern Syrian coast. We do not know whether the relationship between a local ruler and the Assyrian king was formalized by a written pact - though in at least some instances there may well have been some form of agreement drawn up. But generally speaking, local rulers were free to rule their states in whatever manner they wished, without interference from the Assyrian king, unless they took actions which were prejudicial to Assyrian interests, such as participation in an anti-Assyrian alliance with other rulers."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_TrTabal]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Neo-Hittite Kingdoms ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b> Tabal region: "There is nothing in the material record to indicate that it was significantly affected by the upheavals at the end of the Late Bronze Age, or by the collapse of the Hittite empire.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_TrTabal] Tuwana: "Conceivably, the kingdom arose in the wake of the Hittite empire's fall, with a population perhaps largely made up of Luwian elements from Tuwanuwa."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_TrTabal]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Assyrian Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ Neo-Hittite ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Artulu; Tyana ♥</b> Northern Tabal: "Its capital <i>may</i> have been located on the site of modern Kululu, which lies 30 km north-east of Kayseri." c837 BCE the capital was probably the royal city, Artulu.

Its capital of the same name can be safely identified with the Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine city of Tyana whose ruins lie in the modern Turkish village of Kemerhisar, south of Nigde, where a stela of king Warpalawas was found in 1860. Rock monuments in nearby Ivriz and Bulgarmaden mention this king of Tuhana, the latter as the overlord of a local ruler. Finds of Luwian inscriptions suggest the region of Kayseri as the location of Bit-Purutaš/Tabal; the site of Kululu, where monuments of a number of kings of Tabal have been found, is the most likely to correspond to its capital."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_TrTabal]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Luwian ♥</b> "According to a proposal recently made by I.

After the Assyrian invasion they became tribute-sending states to the Mesopotamian Empire but were otherwise "free to rule their states in whatever manner they wished, without interference from the Assyrian king".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_TrTabal][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Known as the kingdoms of 'Tabal', the term an Assyrian administrative designation rather than a political one[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_TrTabal], there were, according to Assyrian records, 24 of them in the mid-9th century BCE. This number had reduced by the middle of the 8th century, which suggests that the states conquered each other or had otherwise joined together to become larger kingdoms.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_TrTabal] Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser III in the mid-late 8th century listed five tributaries he possessed in Tabal: Tabal, Atuna, Tuhana, Ishtu(a)nda, and Hupishna.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_TrTabal] Bryce (2012) adds a sixth kingdom to Tabal, Shinuhtu, which is "attested both in Luwian and Assyrian inscriptions dating to the reign of Sargon II.
