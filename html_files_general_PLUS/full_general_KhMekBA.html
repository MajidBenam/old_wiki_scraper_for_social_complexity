These codes take into account that such temporal bounds may be fuzzy and allow us to capture this 'fuzziness.' For example, some polities such as the Medieval German Empire or China under the Zhou Dynasty began as reasonably coherent states, but with time gradually lost cohesion, the degree to which the center exercized control over regional subpolities. Because this process was gradual, there was no sharp temporal boundary. The 'Degree of centralization' variable allows to capture these transitions (by coding time periods when the polity transitions, for example, from a 'confederated state' to 'loose' and finally to 'nominal' degree of centralization. Similarly, polities may have a fuzzy starting date, if they originate as subpolities under a disintegrating overarching polity. These transitions are captured by the variable 'Supra-polity relations'.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 1200-501 BCE ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ ♥</b>Below code cultural relations between the coded (quasi)polity and the preceding one, as well as those nearby.
