Badarians imported raw materials like wood, turquoise, shells and ivory and exchanged goods with groups from as far away as Palestine, the Red Sea and Syria.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_EgBadar] Model boats found at the site of Merimda to the north 'suggest that boats and canoes were already in use [in Egypt] before 4500 B.C.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_EgBadar][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Very little can be concluded about Badarian political and social structure, but analysis of grave goods shows that there was an unequal distribution of wealth, and that the wealthier graves tended to be kept separate within the cemeteries.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_EgBadar] However, no monumental remains have been found so it is likely that higher-status members of society did not command a significant labour force.</div></body></html>
