After Mu, authority over vassals declined. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_CnWZhou] There also was a widespread insurrection against Mu.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_CnWZhou][MAJIDBENAM_BR] The reign of Mu's predecesser, Zhao, "occurred at a point when the Zhou Dynasty had expanded across the central plains of China and turned its attention to South China." He established "the limit of direct control of the south during the Western Zhou Dynasty." This quote is from wikipedia.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]However, bureaucratization of government after 957 BCE in response to defeat. Perhaps 950-925 BCE period?[MAJIDBENAM_BR]827 or 825 - 782 BCE.

In 957 BCE there was a major military disaster.[MAJIDBENAM_BR] "Achaeological finds attest to what appears to have been a major ritual reform (if not indeed a "cultural revolution"), which may have taken place during the reign of Mu Wang (traditional dates 1001-946; actual dates probably ca. one-half century later. ... assemblages of bronzes in tombs and hoards suggest that the classical Zhou sumptuary system, with its matching sets of ding and gui, originated at that time, indicating a significant reorganization (or at least standardization) of aristocratic society. Art historians have long noted the significant changes in bronze decoration styles in mid-Western Zhou times: the animal derived iconography of earlier times was replaced by more abstract patterns, and the shapes of ritual vessels changed considerably. Given the importance of bronzes in Zhou ritual, such a thorough revamping of the ritual apparatus is likely to bespeak changes in religious ideology."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_CnWZhou][MAJIDBENAM_BR] This disaster appears to have lead to reform of central government and military and increased bureaucratization. King Xuan's reign c825-782 BCE which is thought of as a restoration would be the peak of the second period.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br>Start of polity[MAJIDBENAM_BR]  1122 CE[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Conquest of Shang[MAJIDBENAM_BR] battle of Muye 1045 BCE [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_CnWZhou][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Son of last Shang Empire ruler became a vassal of Zhou King Wu.

Zhou was a tributary state to Shang until the Zhou king Zhou Wu Wang defeated the last king of Shang in the 1046 BCE Battle of Muye.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_CnWZhou] Zhou power was consolidated after the Duke of Zhou's defeat of the Rebellion of the Three Guards, led by Shang loyalists and separatist eastern nobles.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_CnWZhou] In defeating the rebellion, the Zhou state was able to add a large area of land in eastern China to its territory.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_CnWZhou][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Western Zhou established their capital at Haojing, and the Duke of Zhou later established Chengzhou as a second capital.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_CnWZhou] In 957 BCE, the Zhou controlled territory covering an estimated 850,000 square kilometres based in the central plains of China.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The period was peaceful for the first 75 years of Zhou rule.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_CnWZhou] However, the decentralization of Zhou power into fiefdoms encouraged turmoil between states, popular unrest, and vassal rebellions.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_CnWZhou] The Marquess of Shen sacked Haojing and killed the 12th Zhou king over a succession dispute in 771 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_CnWZhou] The crown prince subsequently moved the capital to Luoyang and founded the Eastern Zhou dynasty.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Western Zhou are noted for their introduction of the Mandate of Heaven, their kinship-based feudal system and their use of lineage law.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_CnWZhou] The state's kinship-based feudal system encouraged the spread of Zhou writing, culture and identity.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_CnWZhou] Some scholars have seen Zhou lineage law, with its emphasis on 'lineage rituals, familial ethics, and beneficent rule', as an intellectual precursor of Confucianism.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_CnWZhou] The hierarchies, division of labour and meritocratic practices that emerged under the Western Zhou also helped lay the foundations for the introduction of bureaucracy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_CnWZhou][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Western Zhou state was a proto-feudal monarchy in which feudal lords were supported by an extended family network.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_CnWZhou] The first king of Zhou introduced the <i>fengjian</i> system, which made military leaders and members of the royal family into regional lords ruling over parcels of land.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_CnWZhou] These fiefdoms were then divided into smaller units and distributed to members of the local rulers' families.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_CnWZhou][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Individual fiefdoms had their own taxes, legal systems, and currencies but paid dues to the king and provided soldiers in times of need.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_CnWZhou] This system eventually led to decentralization and the weakening of Zhou rule.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_CnWZhou][MAJIDBENAM_BR]It is difficult to obtain population figures for the Western Zhou period.
