[MAJIDBENAM_REF_43_IrSeljq] "During the late 5th/11th and 6th/12th centuries - a period often called the Sunni revival - a mainstream Sunni camp was emerging in the Islamic Near East. In their effort to end the religious ferment of the late classical period, Muslim scholars (the 'ulama') and others combined to delimit a commonly accepted form of Islam, eliminate various sources of contention within the Islamic community, and set up the tone in the public sphere based on the Sunna and the Shari'a. [...] As a major scene in the crystallisation of the madhhabs and the development of the madrasa in its ‘mature’ form, Seljuq Baghdad figured prominently in the Sunnisation process."
