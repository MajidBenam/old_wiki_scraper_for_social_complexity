Such census registers were kept in Aymonier's day, and revised every three years.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_KhAngkL] 'Because the Angkor kingdom commanded a significant army and a large centralized administrative apparatus and because thousands of workers were needed to build and maintain its enormous building complexes, it has been assumed that around the stone constructions of the palaces and temples a city with a substantial population must have existed.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_KhAngkL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥</b> Relations with China were inconsistent: Jayavarman VIII ignored Chinese demands for tribute and imprisoned Kublai Khan’s envoy.

The Sanskrit language, the vehicle of Hinduism and one sect of Buddhism, and the source of many loan-works in early Khmer. The Indic (Brahmi) writing system, stone inscriptions and palm-leaf books.

Over fifty distinct Austroasiatic languages are spoken across a wide swath of the Asian main- land, stretching from eastern India westward to Vietnam. Of these languages, only Khmer and Mon possess alphabets of their own.The Mons and the Khmers are also the only speakers of Austroasiatic languages to practice settled agri- culture. The earliest evidence of written Khmer comes from an inscription incised in southern Cambodia of the seventh century C.E., using an alphabet derived from southern India, which, in modified form, remains in use in contemporary Cambodia.

proclaimed a 'universal monarch' in a ceremony performed by Sanskrit-speaking priests on a mountain close to the Tonlé Sap lake.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_KhAngkL] By bringing previously independent polities under their control, Jayavarman II and his successors expanded their realm across mainland Southeast Asia, including parts of modern-day Cambodia, Thailand, Laos and Vietnam.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_KhAngkL] Our Late Angkor period begins with the death of King Jayavarman VII around 1200 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_KhAngkL] In contrast to the burgeoning growth of the Khmer Empire during the Classic period, the Late Angkor period was characterized by political and economic decline, culminating in the sack of the city of Angkor by the Thai Kingdom of Ayutthaya in 1431.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_KhAngkL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The reign of Jayavarman VII marked the high point of Angkorean monument-building, and subsequent rulers did not carry out major construction projects at the ancient capital.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_KhAngkL] Chinese diplomat Zhou Daguan visited Angkor in the late 13th century and saw temples capped in gold and copper, sumptuous religious festivals, thousands of slaves and servants, and a lively trade in Chinese goods.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_KhAngkL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_KhAngkL] However, this grandeur concealed the fundamental instability of the state, and the Khmer administrative system with its centre at Angkor eventually disintegrated in the mid-15th century CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_42_KhAngkL] Warfare became 'endemic',[MAJIDBENAM_REF_43_KhAngkL] and after the Ayyuthaya attacks in 1431, the rulers of Angkor moved to south-eastern Cambodia and founded a new capital at Phnom Penh.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_44_KhAngkL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_45_KhAngkL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Numerous small kingdoms formed in the lower Mekong Basin in the mid-1st millennium CE, but until the conquests of Jayavarman II, most failed to outlive their founders.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_46_KhAngkL] Jayavarman II managed to unify previously warring local lords under his aegis, turning independent polities into provinces and laying the foundations for over six centuries of Khmer rule centred on the Siem Reap plain.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_47_KhAngkL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Like many polities in Southeast Asia at the turn of the 1st millennium CE, the new kingdom, with its growing urban centre on the north shore of the Tonlé Sap, borrowed from Indian religious practices, concepts of divine kingship, language, writing and iconography in order to legitimize royal power.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_48_KhAngkL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_49_KhAngkL] Its kings patronized both Hindu and Buddhist institutions, building monasteries and sanctuaries dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu and the Buddha that doubled as outposts of royal power throughout the realm.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_50_KhAngkL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_51_KhAngkL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]However, the Late Angkor period saw a decline in the importance of the Hindu <i>devaraja</i> (god-king) cult, while Theravada Buddhism gained an increasingly stronger foothold among both the people and their rulers.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_52_KhAngkL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_53_KhAngkL] This is reflected in the scarcity of Sanskrit inscriptions referencing Hindu gods ‒ the last known Angkor inscription to use this language dates to 1327[MAJIDBENAM_REF_54_KhAngkL] ‒ and the increasing importance of Pali scriptures.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_55_KhAngkL] While some scholars suggest that this religious shift contributed to the loosening of centralized Khmer power,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_56_KhAngkL] the causes for imperial decline during this period remain a topic of intense scholarly debate.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_57_KhAngkL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The riches of Angkor at the height of its power had always flowed from wet-rice agriculture,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_58_KhAngkL] and an institutionalized hierarchy of officials developed to funnel surplus rice produced in villages, as well as other goods like honey, spices, cloth and gold, to the royal centre.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_59_KhAngkL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_60_KhAngkL] Angkor kings also used corvée labour to build temples, irrigation infrastructure and other public works.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_61_KhAngkL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_62_KhAngkL] In this period, however, rice agriculture decreased in importance in favour of trade and commerce, potentially undermining the traditional power base of the Angkor kings.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_63_KhAngkL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Khmer Empire is famous for its sprawling but low-density urban sites.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_64_KhAngkL] It has been claimed that Angkor itself was the 'largest settlement complex of the preindustrial world':[MAJIDBENAM_REF_65_KhAngkL] at its peak in the 12th century (before this period) it covered 1000 square kilometres and may have housed over 750,000 people.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_66_KhAngkL] However, the total population of the empire in this period is still unclear.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Angkor
