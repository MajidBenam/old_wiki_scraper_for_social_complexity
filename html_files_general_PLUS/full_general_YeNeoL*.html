    <div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion-Sect ♣ ♥</b>The Yemeni Coastal Plain or Plateau is the northwestern region of
        modern Yemen that lies between the Red Sea and the Yemeni Mountains. Here, we are interested in the phase of its
        prehistory known as the Neolithic (c. 3500-1201 BCE). Settlements at this time were small clusters of oval huts,
        with stone tools and stone manufacture debris but no pottery remains.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_YeNeoL*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]No
        speculation could be found in the literature regarding possible forms of political organisation prevalent at the
        time; from an archaeological perspective, not enough is known about the few buildings that have been excavated
        to interpret them as having been used for administrative purposes, and the earliest known state-managed food
        storage structures in the region date to the third century BCE. Similarly, there are no serious works on the
        estimates for the area and population in the Neolithic and Bronze Age Yemen.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_YeNeoL*]</div>
