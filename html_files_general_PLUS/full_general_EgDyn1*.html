First-Dynasty Egypt was likely not yet divided into the clearly demarcated provinces, controlled by local governors, that we find in later periods.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_EgDyn1*] There is no clear evidence for professional priests or large-scale religious organization, but there may have been temple compounds within settlements, serving different ritual functions from the funerary complexes located outside the towns.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_EgDyn1*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Egyptian population during the Early Dynastic period is difficult to determine, but the archaeologist Bruce Trigger estimated that there could have been over 2 million people living in the Nile Valley at this time.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_EgDyn1*]</div></body></html>
