Attempts by scholars such as Maurizio Tosi to find evidence of differentiation and increasing complexity were not born out by the evidence. While recording systems are present, stamp seals and sealing, these appeared to be quite localized in terms of their production.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_PkPostU]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ unknown ♥</b> It is impossible to say what sort of polity or what size might be connected with Pirak, however it seems to have been part of a larger network of exchange from I onwards, and the buildings discovered are larger than one would expect in a small village. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_PkPostU] "...it has proved impossible for the moment to define in a less summary fashion its probable area of geographical distribution. As far as the region is concerned, the mound of Pirak is the only one of its kind."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_PkPostU]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Kachi Plain - Urban Period II ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Kachi Plain - Proto-Historic Period ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ unknown ♥</b>Given that the degree of integration with the wider Indus Valley is not clear, a capital cannot be named.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ ♥</b> Nothing is known about the spoken language(s) in use.

Here we consider Pirak I, that is, the phase of Pirak's occupation that corresponds to the best part of the second millennium BCE. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_PkPostU] It seems very likely that Pirak was part of a larger assemblage of culturally similar settlements, but, perhaps due to the erosive effects of nearby rivers, only Pirak remains.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_PkPostU] Notable archaeological finds from the site at this time include terracotta seals, horse and camel figurines, and zoomorphic game pieces, and the site's architecture and agricultural infrastructure is somewhat reminiscent of the Indus Valley Civilization.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_PkPostU][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Not much appears to be known about Pirak's political organization, although the retrieval of terracotta seals[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_PkPostU] suggests perhaps the existence of some form of bureaucracy.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The scholarly literature does not provide population estimates.</div></body></html>
