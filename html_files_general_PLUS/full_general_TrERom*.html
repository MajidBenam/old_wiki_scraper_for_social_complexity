"The Eastern Empire enjoyed an expansion phase c.285-450, when the population and elite numbers were low. The stagflation phase spanned c.450-541, when large estates began to appear again, when elites became more numerous and powerful, and the frequency of elite infighting and sociopolitical instability increased. The Justinian Plague struck in 541 and reduced the common population, gradually halting the expansion of the Eastern Empire, and culminating in the usurpations and civil wars of the seventh century. This was followed shortly thereafter by collapse in the Arab Conquests."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_TrERom*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Justinian died in 565, leaving a vastly expanded but perilously overstretched empire, in financial as well as in military terms. His successors were faced with the reality of dealing with new enemies, lack of ready cash, and internal discontent over high taxation and constant demands for soldiers and the necessities to support them."

It was only with the Arab rulers that there had long been some recognition of equality, and also with the Persian kings, which was reflected in the title of 'brother' used in official documents."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_TrERom*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣ [13,000,000-14,000,000] ♥</b>km squared.

Meetings of the emperor's council were infused with an atmosphere of sanctity, and the historian H. W. Haussig has pointed out that many important decisions were in fact 'discussed and settled outside this body'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_TrERom*] The most important religious official in Constantinople was the patriarch, who was chosen by the emperor;[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_TrERom*] the pope in Rome was the most important of the five patriarchs of the Roman Empire as a whole.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_TrERom*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Based in the palatial city of Constantinople, the emperor presided over a large professional bureaucracy that sought to intervene in most aspects of its citizens' lives. Departing from the old pattern of relative Roman disinterest in the formal codification of Roman law, the East Roman emperors in the 395‒631 CE period twice brought together and promulgated official legal codes that were sourced from the empire's Christian era (that is, since the time of Constantine the Great). The first of these was the <i>Codex Theodosianus</i> (439 CE), which was followed by the <i>Codex Justinianus</i> (534 CE). The Eastern Roman Empire also maintained a formal alliance with the Western Roman Empire, meaning that laws promulgated in one half of the empire had to be communicated to the other half and applied in both East and West.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_TrERom*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Below the god-emperor was the office of praetorian prefect, which came with considerable temporal powers. The governmental reforms of 395 CE gave this official 'unlimited jurisdiction' on economic matters,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_TrERom*] which he used to plan the Roman economy in a similar way to that of Egypt, which had been functioning well for six centuries.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_TrERom*] The praetorian prefect also supervised the postal system and public works, managed the guilds, and ran the production of arms and other manufactured goods as a state monopoly. He was responsible for the <i>annona</i> (food distribution) to the cities and army, and was given license to control prices in the cities and order new industrial production.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_TrERom*] The government had numerous other officials and departments, including a magister officiorum who, in addition to running the departments of protocol and foreign affairs and the palace guard, was also head of the 'political police (<i>schola agentium in rebus</i>)'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_TrERom*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the 6th century, desperate economic times led to the payment of high officials and soldiers in luxury clothes, while manufactured goods and food were used as currency. Coinage was still in circulation but the proportion used as payment for salaries shrank considerably.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_TrERom*] The number of residents in Constantinople grew from about 300,000 in 400 CE to 500,000 a century later, but then fell back sharply to about 200,000 due to the troubles of the 6th century. The baseline population of the empire was about 15 million, which peaked at 20 million when times were still good in 500 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Fifth-century Constantinople was a monumental city of great splendour and wealth: it possessed five imperial palaces, six <i>domus divinae Augustarum</i> ('mansions of the divine Augustae') belonging to empresses, three <i>domus nobilissimae</i> (mansions for the top nobility) and 4,388 <i>domus</i> mansions.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_TrERom*][MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_TrERom*] The contemporary source (the 5th-century <i>Notitia urbis Constantinopolitanae</i>) also records 322 streets with 153 private baths.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_TrERom*][MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_TrERom*] Public buildings included squares, baths, underground cisterns, aqueducts, shops, and entertainment buildings including theatres and hippodromes.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_TrERom*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Gladiatorial combat was banned as part of Constantine's programme of Christian moral reforms in 325 CE and disappeared sometime in the 5th century. The traditional Greek gymnasium, once a central institution in every Graeco-Roman city, where young men trained in athletics, had also fallen out of use but acrobatics was a profession and the nobility enjoyed various sports.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_TrERom*] The most impressive large-scale public entertainments, provided by the state, were chariot races. These were held in Constantinople and other cities of the empire.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_TrERom*] At some point during this era, the government decreed that drinking booths should close at 7 pm to reduce alcohol-related disorder.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_TrERom*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Eastern Roman Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ EasternRoman_400CE: 395CE-499CE; EasternRoman_500CE: 500CE-599CE; EasternRoman_600CE: 600CE-631CE ♥</b>  EasternRoman_400CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_TrERom*] EasternRoman_500CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_TrERom*] EasternRoman_600CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_TrERom*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  2232047: 395CE-499CE;  2232047: 500CE-599CE;  2941223: 600CE-631CE  ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Graeco-Phrygian ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Greek ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Christianity ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Orthodox Christianity ♥</b></div></body></html>
