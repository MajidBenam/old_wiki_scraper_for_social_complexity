The Greekness of Greco-Bactrian and Indo-Greek religion is, however, more difficult to defend. The religious practices of people who asserted, in public discourse, and especially political imagery, a connection with Greeks and Greece were diverse. Greek gods were depicted on coins and temple images, but whether in the use of Near Eastern temple designs or in the dedication of Buddhist relics, Greek cults were only part of the religious constellation of the region. [...] As well as the cults of Greek gods, other religions flourished in the Greco-Bactrian and Indo-Greek kingdoms. In Bactria, the river Oxus was worshipped, and the archaeological evidence is also suggestive of the existence of other local and Near Eastern cults, both within the precincts of shrines such as the Ai Khanoum temples and the Temple of the Oxus, and in independent locations. In India, we find evidence of the importance of Buddhism and the cults of Indian gods both to the region's inhabitants, Greek and non-Greek, and in political display.//"There was considerable flexibility in iconography and religious practice in the Hellenistic Far East: sites might serve as foci of multiple religious rites, perhaps with different ethnic 'slants', and be patronized by more than one ethnic group, or by individuals with a more complex personal ethnic identity. The use of multiple names for the same temple or divine image need not necessarily have operated at the level of officially orchestrated or approved syncretism. But if this did occur, as I suspect it did, it may have allowed diverse ethnic communities to use the same site without the necessity of 'appropriating' the deity and its worship for any particular ethnic affiliation. This is not to impute any degree of 'split personality' to the identity and iconography of the divinity. Greeks may have looked at the 'Dioskouroi' at Dil'berdzhin and seen one thing, and local Bactrians may have looked at them and seen another (how would a Greek and a Bactrian have referred to them in conversation with one another?). On the other hand, it is possible that people who looked at such an image did so with a conscious awareness that it was more all-encompassing, something that could have the attributes of one god without denying its identity as the other."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_AfGrBct]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Genus ♣ Buddhism ♥</b> "In India, we find evidence of the importance of Buddhism and the cults of Indian gods both to the region's inhabitants, Greek and non-Greek, and in political display."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_AfGrBct]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion ♣ ♥</b><a href="/w/index.php?title=File:800pxGrecoBactrianKingdomMap.jpg" class="image"><img alt="800pxGrecoBactrianKingdomMap.jpg" src="/w/images/thumb/1/1e/800pxGrecoBactrianKingdomMap.jpg/400px-800pxGrecoBactrianKingdomMap.jpg" srcset="/w/images/thumb/1/1e/800pxGrecoBactrianKingdomMap.jpg/600px-800pxGrecoBactrianKingdomMap.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/1/1e/800pxGrecoBactrianKingdomMap.jpg/800px-800pxGrecoBactrianKingdomMap.jpg 2x" width="400" height="306"></a>[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_AfGrBct][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Greco-Bactrian Kingdom was a hereditary monarchy founded in the mid-3rd century BCE, probably by the Seleucid satrap Diodotus I,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_AfGrBct] as a successor kingdom of the Seleucid Empire.
