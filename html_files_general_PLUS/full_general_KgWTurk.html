That is the beginning of the First Turkic Khaganate. The leaders of the Turks were Bumin and his younger brother, Istemi. The Turks were a member group of the Juan-Juan confederation, with their ancestral origins in the Altai Mountains."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_KgWTurk][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Khagan Bumin founded the First Turkic (Göktürk) Khaganate that was de facto divided into an eastern and a western part. The ruler of the western part was Khagan Istemi."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_KgWTurk][MAJIDBENAM_BR]c582 CE: "The First Turkic Khaganate officially split into the Western and the Eastern Turkic Khaganate.

It is dated to 630 by Györffy et al. and to 627 by Rogers.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"To the west the situation was more stable, in spite of revolts, but after 630 the qaghanate disintegrated into several tribal confederations, with the On Oq in Central Asia and the Bulgars to the west." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_KgWTurk]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ loose; confederated state ♥</b> " Politically, the Türk Empire “grew out of a tribal confederation.” It had a core of “inner tribes” (the ruling clan and its allies, including “in-law” tribes), a second tier of tribes that joined freely (retaining their ruling houses), a third tier of tribes that joined under constraint (and whose ruling houses were usually replaced by state officials), and finally tribute-paying sedentary populations. Subject populations retaining their own kings included the Sogdians, with their major centers at Bukhara and Samarkand and farflung merchant colonies, willing collaborators with a nomadic state that possessed the military power to force open the Chinese markets.76" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_KgWTurk]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ ♥</b>  “The Western Qaganate, which was in and out of submission to China, was able to hold out longer, primarily because the Tang were no longer able to project their power that far to the west.&nbsp;» [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_KgWTurk]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ First Turk Khaganate ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b> "The half-century which followed is more confused: the western qaghanate became politically independent in 583, and dynastic rivalries emerged which were exploited on one hand by the Chinese, and on the other by certain subject tribes."

The Sui-shu calls him master of the ancient territory of the Wu-sun, i.e. the iii valley. As the ally of the Byzantine emperor, Herakleios (610-641) he warred with Iran in Transcaucasia, contributing significantly to the Byzantine victory and the collapse of the Sâsânid state. From his capital at Ch'ien-Ch'üan ("1000 Springs," east of the Talas), he established an orderly government, sending tuduns (or toôuns, Chin. t'u-t'un [tou-du;:,n] (tax officials105) to supervise the el/il-tebers (Chin. hsieh-li-fa [giet-lji-piwat (piwar)] a title given to governors of conquered peoples106) and established good relations with Tang China, which contributed, along with mutual raiding, in sorne measure to the destruction of the Eastern Qaganate."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_KgWTurk] "As the Türk Qaganate expanded and came into greater contact witb surrounding cultures, it was influenced by the religions of the conquered populations. Tbus, Mazdaism, other Iranian religious systems (e.g. Zurvanism) and Buddbist influences came to the fore during the era of the First Qaganate. Mugan and Taspar both fostered Buddbism. This is reflected in the Bugut inscription whicb dates to the second generation of Türk rulers (570's or 580's) and was written in Sogdian."
