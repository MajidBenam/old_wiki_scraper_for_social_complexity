[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_ItPapHM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Peak Date ♣ 1240 CE ♥</b>   Innocent III was the king maker of Christendom (e.g. Frederick, in 1214 CE): "In the eleventh century, emperors had appointed popes without consulting any Roman prelate. Now the pope had chosen an emperor." "This was not the last "political" conflict, or victory, during Innocent's pontificate. Innocent was involved in disputes with King Philip II of France .... and with King John of England .... He won resounding victories in both cases. ... King John gave England as a fief to the papacy, and Philip was forced to choose Ingeborg as queen. In a short time, Innocent had twice chosen an emperor and won battles with the other two major states in western Europe, as well as victories over smaller states, like Portugal and Castile. To a greater degree than any pontiff before or since, Innocent achieved the dream of Gregory VII and became, in fact as well as in theory, the undisputed leader of Christendom."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_ItPapHM] "If Gregory saw himself as the agent of Peter, with whom he had a sense of a powerfully intimate kinship, Innocent viewed himself explicitly as the vicar of Christ, priest and king, who possessed unrivaled temporal and religious authority."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_ItPapHM] "Papal power and control had reached its height" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_ItPapHM] - context of discussion Louis IX of France c1240 CE (?).</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 1198-1309 CE ♥</b>  In this period the Papacy, from Innocent III, extended its power over the temporal realm, and over Christendom. The period ends with the Angevin exile from 1309 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"It would be the job of Roman canonists, legates, and Popes in the wake of Innocent's pontificate to develop just that machinery, to seize traditional local and episcopal power, and even to create business for the pope, thereby making Innocent's dreams real in practice. (Some of these activities were under way by the time of Innocent's pontificate, but they grew after his death, sometimes by orders of magnitude.) Future cannons and popes achieved these dreams primarily by developing the canon law, by convoking western councils, by hearing thousands of cases in Rome from litigants streaming in from all over Europe, by seizing oversight in the canonization of saints, and by taking over appointments to ecclesiastical offices, and by providing other papal benefits. All of this would have been impossible without the general acceptance that the pope was the vicar of Christ and the growing sense of Christians, nourished by the reforms of the eleventh century, that they were part of a supranational entity, Christendom (Christianitas), and that their primary loyalty was to that body and to the pope as head of Christendom, rather than to any local, regional, or even national entity."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_ItPapHM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ nominal; loose; confederated state; unitary state ♥</b>  "The centralization of the church had also resulted in its bureaucratization. The church at its center seemed less like a religious body and more like a governmental institution; the pope was not the spiritual leader of Christendom but a man of business, a lawyer. His aims seemed less governed by a religious agenda than a political one. And, always, he was asking for more and more money."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_ItPapHM][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>RC: The Papal states in this period fluctuated repeatedly between 3, or all 4 degrees of centralization. It had various factions of feudal noble vassals, ecclesiastical bureaucrats, and factions of Roman families, and the power dynamics between these forces and the papacy greatly affected the degree of centralization.</i></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ alliance ♥</b>Armies of the Papal States were a conglomeration of international allies, friendly towns and nobles, volunteer crusaders, and the forces directly raised by the pope.

With the evolution of independent political and physical territories, soon to be called national monarchies or states, Christians began to choose between allegiance to state and devotion to church, and many chose the former. By the fifteenth century, the papacy ceased to function as a universal power and more and more like another regional Italian prince jealously guarding his fiefdom." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_ItPapHM] The term Christendom (Christianitas) reflects the supranational scope of the Papacy, which being also an international religion, had a degree of control beyond the territorial borders of the Papal State, particularly in the period from the Papacy of Innocent III.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_ItPapHM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Rome; Avignon ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Latin ♥</b> <i>JFR: Latin was the language of administration, but by this period various dialects of Italian (Romanesco in the city of Rome; Romagnola in Emilia-Romagna; and so forth) were emerging as written languages, besides being the languages of everyday speech.</i></div><div class='meatypart'></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Genus ♣ Christianity ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Family ♣ Catholic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion ♣ Roman Catholic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Genus ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion ♣ ♥</b><a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Map_of_Italy_in_1300_(simplified)-NL.svg">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Map_of_Italy_in_1300_(simplified)-NL.svg</a>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the 1198-1309 CE period the Papacy, from Innocent III, extended its power over the temporal realm, and over Christendom.

He initiated several crusades and presided over the Fourth Lateran Council[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_ItPapHM] that defined an important Catholic ritual, the Eucharist.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Innocent III "viewed himself explicitly as the vicar of Christ, priest and king, who possessed unrivaled temporal and religious authority"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_ItPapHM] and this combined with a "general acceptance that the pope was the vicar of Christ and the growing sense of Christians, nourished by the reforms of the eleventh century, that they were part of a supranational entity, Christendom (Christianitas), and that their primary loyalty was to that body and to the pope as head of Christendom, rather than to any local, regional, or even national entity."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_ItPapHM][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Armies of the Papal States were a conglomeration of international allies, friendly towns and nobles, volunteer crusaders, and the forces directly raised by the pope.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_ItPapHM] The papal state formed many alliances with during this period, held the nominal allegiance of some polities (the Norman duchies to the south are just one good example of both of these), and held vassals of its own (albeit ones that were notoriously difficult to control). War with the Holy Roman Empire characterised the Papal State's international relations.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Based at the Lateran Palace in Rome, the Papal bureaucracy consisted of scribes, archivists, tax collectors, papal messengers, and administrators charged with the upkeep of the city[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_ItPapHM] which at this time was no greater than the size of a large town, with about 35,000 inhabitants.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_ItPapHM]</div></body></html>
