Upon Saladin's death in 1192, his brothers and sons warred among themselves for the throne and for undisputed possession of fragments of the empire he had erected in Syria, Iraq, and Egypt. ... Such was the situation in 1215 when, in Yemen, Tughtakin's second son, al-Nasir Ayyub, died of poison administered by the Kurdish commander of the Mamelukes. The late king's mother sent for a distant relative, a great-grandson of Saladin's brother Shahanshah Nur al-Din, to assume rule. Al-Kamil, however, had aspirations for his own branch of the clan, and fitted out his adolescent son al-Mas'ud Yusuf with a strong force. With the advice and help of the Rasul brothers, Mas'ud succeeded in capturing his rival and sent him in chains to Egypt. Mas'ud appointed the Rasulid Nur al-Dun 'Umar his atabeg, an office which covered command of the troops as well as counsel to the young prince. Friendship between the two grew close during the fourteen years of Mas'ud's reign in Yemen. Al-Kamil succeeded to the Ayyubid throne upon al-Adil's death in 1218, and some years later summoned Mas'ud to govern Syria on his behalf. Mas'ud's departure was marked by a thorough looting of Yemen [by Mas'ud], and by the contingent transfer of power to his atabeg."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_YeRasul][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Ends when the Rasulid amir of Aden surrenders to the Tahirids and the last Rasulid Sultan, Salah al-Din b.

During the thirteenth to fifteenth centuries CE, the region—along with the eastern portion of southern Arabia—was ruled by the Rasūlid Dynasty. Prior to this date, Yemen had formed part of the Ayyūbid Sultanate, centered in Egypt.
