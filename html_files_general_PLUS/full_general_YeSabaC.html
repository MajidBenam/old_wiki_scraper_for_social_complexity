Subsequently, the Sabaean ‘cultural model’ spread over a wide area including the entirety of Yemen, Ethiopia, the areas neighbouring Yemen, such as Najrān, western Arabia between Najrān and the Levant, and as far as the shores of the Arab-Persian Gulf, as indicated by evidence for the use of the Sabaean alphabet. Sabaean culture was expressed in the lexicon and phraseology of inscriptions and in the use of writing for decorative purposes. It is also reflected in an iconographic repertoire which applies a range of geometric figures, such as denticles, striations, and hollowed-out rectangles; emblematic animals, such as ibexes, oryxes, bulls, bucrania, ostriches; symbols, such as the hand, the crescent, the circle; and stylized representations, such as ‘eye stelae’."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_YeSabaC]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ none ♥</b> "Until the end of the third century AD, when the kingdom of Ḥimyar, which had just expelled an Ethiopian invasion, annexed the kingdom of Sabaʾ and conquered Ḥaḍramawt (Ch. 3), South Arabia was divided between numerous kingdoms".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_YeSabaC][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Language</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Sabaic; Mainic; Qatabanic; Hadramawtic; Old Arabic ♥</b> "five major languages attested—Sabaʾic, Maʿīnic, Qatabānic, Ḥaḍramawtic, and Old Arabic"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_YeSabaC]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic Family ♣ Semitic ♥</b> "Our understanding of South Arabian languages rests first of all on ‘Semitic comparatism’, which consists of identifying terms with the same meaning in other Semitic languages."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_YeSabaC]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language Genus ♣ Afro-Asiatic ♥</b><b>Religion</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious Tradition ♣ South Arabian Religions ♥</b> "The inscriptions from South Arabia list an extensive number of deities and allude to numerous religious rites.

Beginning in the ninth and eighth centuries BCE, this region became part of a wider "Sabaean" culture region (from the name of the dominant kingdom, Saba), in which many relatively small kingdoms across south and western Arabia, as well as Ethiopia, shared the same alphabet, the same iconographic repertoire (e.g. widespread depiction of animals such as ibexes and oryxes, and use of symbols such as hands, crescents, and circles), and the same vocabulary and turns of phrases in inscriptions. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_YeSabaC][MAJIDBENAM_BR]At this time, the largest town in the Yemeni Coastal Plain was Marib, which covered an area of 100 hectares, for a population of about 30,000-40,000.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_YeSabaC] It is unclear, however, what the average population of a single kingdom would have been.</div></body></html>
