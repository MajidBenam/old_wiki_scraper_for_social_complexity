[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_EgRegns][MAJIDBENAM_BR]King Wahankh Intef II: "The newly founded state was organized not as a loose knit network of semi-independent magnates, as the Old Kingdom had become toward its end, but as a powerful system relying on strong bonds of personal loyalty and on tight control."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_EgRegns][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"We know less about his adversaries, although it seems that the cause of the Herakleopolitan Kings was prosecuted by the nomarchs of Asyut."  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_EgRegns][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Mentuhotep/Nebhepetre reunited Egypt under one ruler. "Egyptologists usually cautiously put the reunification of Egypt as taking place in or about Mentuhotep's regnal year 39, c.2007 BC."

There were important provincial centres which vied for control, until a monarchy based at Thebes was established in the 11th Dynasty. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_EgRegns][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In lower Egypt the Herakleopolitan Kingdom had its capital at Herakleopolis Magna (in northern Middle Egypt near the Faiyyum), but the "Herakeopolitans never had control over southern Upper Egypt."

There was no single capital at this time. Instead, there were several powerful hereditary rulers scattered throughout the region, including the Herakleopolitan kings in the north and the Theban Eleventh Dynasty in the south.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_EgRegns][MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_EgRegns][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]During the Period of the Regions, different local rulers vied for control of the former provinces (the nomes of the Late Old Kingdom). In Upper Egypt, around Thebes, the Eleventh Dynasty was able to establish a centralized system of regional administration. Interestingly, this dynasty lacked the powerful provincial nomarchs that characterized the Late Old Kingdom, which perhaps presages the unitary state of the Middle Kingdom.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_EgRegns][MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_EgRegns][MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_EgRegns][MAJIDBENAM_BR]At this early date, however, the Theban Kingdom was relatively unimportant and removed from developments elsewhere in Egypt.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_EgRegns] Further south along the Nile river, a local governor at Mo'alla, Ankhtifi, waged war on his own behalf without deferring to royal power and claimed authority over multiple southern nomes.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_EgRegns] The political fragmentation of the period is further illustrated by the 'glaring gap' in monument-building across Egypt.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_EgRegns] Nevertheless, provincial rulers did command sufficient resources to build monumental <i>mastaba</i> tombs and the Theban Kingdom is notable for its rock-cut <i>saff</i> tombs.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_EgRegns][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Although the Intermediate Periods of Egypt are popularly thought of as being synonymous with disruption and a downturn in fortunes for the Egyptian people, several Egyptologists now argue that this assumption is misleading, at least for the First period: they instead contend that economic productivity was generally high during the late Old Kingdom and remained so through the Period of the Regions.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_EgRegns] The main difference was that the king and his court lost power and access to much of this wealth, as the power of local rulers grew vis-à-vis the central state. In fact, despite its portrayal in Middle Kingdom literature as a time of depression, the First Intermediate Period was characterized by dynamism and creativity.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_EgRegns] Popular culture flourished and evidence from burials shows that local populations enjoyed 'conspicuous, if modest, wealth'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_EgRegns][MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_EgRegns]</div></body></html>
