Literature and the arts flourished, and the capital of Malkhed was built. Of the three main religions (Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism), the Emperor favoured Jainism particularly, but, like all other Rashtrakuta rulers, Amoghavarsa I was tolerant and financially generous towards all faiths [MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_InRasht].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 753-973 CE ♥</b> The Rashtrakuta Empire begins with the first territorial annexations of the dynasty's founder, Dantidurga's, as well as his military success against his feudal overlords, the Chalukyas. The Empire fell when the Chalukya dynasty managed to re-establish their supremacy in the region [MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_InRasht].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ loose ♥</b> The Emperor was "the source of all power and the head of the civil, military as well as judicial administration"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_InRasht]. However, he did not rule directly over annexed territories: rather, he subdivided his empire among his subordinates (feudatories), who in turn subdivided their own territories among their own subordinates (sub-feudatories), and "feudatories and sub-feudatories enjoyed almost complete autonomy"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_InRasht].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥</b> Independent polity.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Chalukyas of Badami ♥</b> In the first half of the eighth century, the Chalukyas ruled over Western and Central India. However, in the '40s and early '50s of that century, they found themselves in a position of weakness, due to the death of their leader, Vikramaditya II, as well as prolonged conflict with Arabs and the Pallavas to the North. One of their feudatories to the South, Dantidurga, exploited this moment of weakness to annex several territories to his own rule. By the time he had secured dominion over Madhya Pradesh and Central and Southern Gujarat, the Chalukyas declared war against him, but were defeated in battle in 753 CE. This is the year when the Rashtrakuta Empire is said to have started, with Dantidurga as its first ruler. Once the Chalukyas were definitively overthrown by Dantidurga's successor, Krishna I, the Rashtrakutas' military and diplomatic endeavours focused mostly on two objectives: securing control over Southern India, particularly the Deccan Plateau, and organising military expeditions to the North.

Subsequently, a number of other feudatories declared independence from Rashtrakuta rule. Eventually, most of them were brought under control by the newly re-established Chalukyas.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_InRasht][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Rashtrakutas rapidly became undisputed rulers of the Deccan Plateau, and organized several successful expeditions in Northern India, even securing, for a time, the long-contested region of Kanauj (under Indra III). However, none of the territorial gains made during these expeditions could be held for more than a short period, and it appears that the main aim of the expeditions was not so much to extend Rashtrakuta rule as to advertise its military might and increase its prestige.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_InRasht] Under the long and relatively peaceful reign of Amoghavarsa I or Nrpatunga (814-878 CE), literature and the arts flourished, and the capital of Malkhed was built.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_InRasht][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Rashtrakuta emperor was the head of the civil, military and judicial administration.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_InRasht] However, he did not rule directly over annexed territories: rather, he subdivided his empire among his subordinates (feudatories), who in turn subdivided their own territories among their own subordinates (sub-feudatories), and feudatories and sub-feudatories enjoyed a significant degree of autonomy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_InRasht][MAJIDBENAM_BR]No overall population estimates could be found in the literature. The capital, Malkhed or Manyakheta, may have had around 100,000 inhabitants,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_InRasht] However, estimates are made difficult by the fact that the capital was destroyed by Chola armies in the 10th century CE, and what was left was subsequently destroyed by the armies of the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughals. Today, the Rashtrakuta capital is little more than a village. Not only that, but what little information exists about the city's heyday appears to be strongly influenced by Jain tradition, which may be biased, considering that Malkhed used to be a major centre for the religion.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_InRasht]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Rashtrakuta Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Rashtrakuta_800CE: 753CE-899CE; Rashtrakuta_900CE: 900CE-973CE ♥</b>  Rashtrakuta_800CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_InRasht] Rashtrakuta_900CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_InRasht]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  850697: 753CE-899CE;  761220: 900CE-973CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Indo-Iranian ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Sanskrit ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Hinduism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Vaishnavism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition ♣ Hinduism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religion Family ♣ Saivism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition2 ♣ Jainism ♥</b></div></body></html>
