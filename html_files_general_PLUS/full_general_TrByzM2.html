It claimed to be at the apex of the family of kings; it was the father, they were the sons. ... It was only with the Arab rulers that there had long been some recognition of equality, and also with the Persian kings, which was reflected in the title of 'brother' used in official documents."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_TrByzM2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣ [15,000,000-20,000,000] ♥</b>km squared.

In 923 CE "a year-long wave of persecutions by Muslims against Christians swept through the Middle East.

The Byzantine culture of the period was a military and aristocratic one with palaces serving "not only as imperial residences but also as administrative centres. They were placed prominently in the centre of cities and surpassed all other public buildings in scale and ostentation."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_TrByzM2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the previous period the Byzantines responded to the Arab conquests with the creation of themes, whose local commander governors could raise taxes, that enabled the Byzantine elites and their thematic armies to respond more rapidly to external threats with the result of less centralized control. In this era the powers of the themes were drawn back: the number of officials within the thematic administrations increased and by the end of the period the strategos, military governor, was replaced by a krites (judge).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_TrByzM2] In the early eleventh century Basil II brought in a professional army directed from Constantinople called the tagmata, which lead to the disappearance of the thematic armies.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_TrByzM2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The professional Byzantine civil service and palace staff was "relatively small, and mostly composed of humble clerks or custodians", although there were some very rich bureaucrats and dignitaries.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_TrByzM2] In the 10th CE the most important official was the Grand Chamberlain, who worked in the Great Palace, and was especially influential during periods of regency or when the Emperor was on military campaign.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_TrByzM2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]A significant codification of Byzantine law occurred in this period when Leo VI (886-912 CE) in six volumes and sixty books (variously called the Exavivlos or the Vasilika (Basilika)) presented in the Greek language "virtually all the laws in the Justinian Corpus, arranged here (as it had not been before) in a systematic manner."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_TrByzM2] A resurgence of literature began, in the early ninth CE, after the Iconoclasm had motivated copying and reading of religious literature. Intellectuals began to receive government positions under "iconoclast emperors". Emperor Theophilus founded Magnaura Palace school, "the empire's first known public school since the reign of Heraclius."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_TrByzM2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The peak of Byzantine military power and international prestige was under Emperor Basil II who conquered the Bulgarian Empire and continued Byzantine expansion into Syria and Armenia.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_TrByzM2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Byzantine Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Byzantine_900CE: 867CE-999CE; Byzantine_1000CE: 1000CE-1072CE ♥</b>  Byzantine_1000CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_TrByzM2] Byzantine_900CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_TrByzM2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  974212: 867CE-999CE;  1130463: 1000CE-1072CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Graeco-Phrygian ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Greek ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Christianity ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Orthodox Christianity ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Sect ♣ Byzantine Orthodox Christianity: 1000CE ♥</b></div></body></html>
