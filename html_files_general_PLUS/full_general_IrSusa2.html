The latter is to be understood as an organisation that solidly controls and defends a given territory (and its many communities) and manages the exploitation of resources to ensure and develop the survival of its population. What distinguishes the State is the stratified, yet organically coherent, structure of the human groups constituting it. In other words, the formation of the State placed collective interests above individual ones (or of individual groups such as families, villages and so on), the former being pursued in the various functions and contributions provided by each group."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_IrSusa2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"A period of depopulation, characterized by political competition between Susa in the west and Chogha Mish in the east led to the rather enigmatic Late Uruk polity in which Chogha Mish was independent of Susa."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_IrSusa2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Susa I ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Susa III ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ Sumerian ♥</b> "very clear Mesopotamian character of the ceramic industry at this time."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_IrSusa2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Susa ♥</b> "Susa ... began its political life around 6000 BC, first as a city-state, then as an empire rivaling Sumer in Mesopotamia, and subsequently as the capital of one of the oldest empires of antiquity, Elam, around 3000 BC."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_IrSusa2] "A period of depopulation, characterized by political competition between Susa in the west and Chogha Mish in the east led to the rather enigmatic Late Uruk polity in which Chogha Mish was independent of Susa."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_IrSusa2] -- this implies previous to this Susa was a ruling center</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Sumerian ♥</b>  Sumerian in neighbouring Mesopotamia: "Until Sargon, records from Akkad had been written in Sumerian."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_IrSusa2]</div><div class='meatypart'></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣  ♥</b>[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_IrSusa2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Uruk (IrSusa1)"Sometime during the fourth millennium, in the urban center of Uruk (for which the archaeological period is named), southern Mesopotamia acquired a specifically Sumerian historical identity. With the introduction of a system of writing, a gradual development from an earlier accounting system, a radical change occurred in the social organization and in the very foundations of thought. ... Susa, in its earliest period (Susa I) attached to the world of the Iranian plateau, was now (in Susa II) integrated into the early Sumerian civilization of Mesopotamia, which it interpreted with originality. Precise stratigraphic excavations conducted in recent decades have allowed us to trace developments at Susa in the Uruk phase, notably of an accounting system that preceded the slightly later appearance of writing."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_IrSusa2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br>Chronology for Iran[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_IrSusa2][MAJIDBENAM_BR] Uruk colonies[MAJIDBENAM_BR] Proto-Elamite period 3100-2700 BCE[MAJIDBENAM_BR] Awan 2350-2200 BCE (contemporaneous with Akkad in Lower Mesopotamia)[MAJIDBENAM_BR] Simash 2050-1950 BCE[MAJIDBENAM_BR] Sukkalmah 1900-1750 BCE[MAJIDBENAM_BR] Middle Elamite kingdom c1300-1100 BCE[MAJIDBENAM_BR] Neo-Elamite kingdom 750-650 BCE[MAJIDBENAM_BR] Media 650-550 BCE[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Susa - Tal-i Malyan (Anshan, Anzan) [450-550] KM2.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br>Liverani 2014 chronology for Isin-Larsa period 2000-1750 BCE[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_IrSusa2] Elam[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_IrSusa2][MAJIDBENAM_BR] 2000 BCE Shimashki dynasty, Kindattu c2000 BCE ...

However, being a rival to Sumer, Babylon, and Assyria, the Elamite federal government developed the first Iranian tradition of public administration on a massive scale, though that tradition originated much earlier in the great city-state of Susa."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_IrSusa2][MAJIDBENAM_BR] "development of an active intergovernmental management and federalism, perhaps the earliest in history."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_IrSusa2][MAJIDBENAM_BR] "In the cities, thriving activities reigned, where along with the villages, professions of all kinds flourished, showing clear evidence of variety and stratification of professional and, hence, social classes in ancient Elam." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_IrSusa2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The development of centers on the Susiana plane, beginning with Middle Cha1colithic Chogha Mish and culminating in the rise of Susa during the Late Chalcolithic. suggests a trend towards regional control in some economic and administrative activities (Delougaz and Kantor 1996, Hole 1987b: 89-90). This trend towards centralization may also be suggested by the presence of possible elite or "Khan's" houses during this time at several sites (Hole 1987a: 41). In spite of these trends, Chalcolithic society throughout Khuzistan presents a strong egalitarian appearance. During the Middle and Late Chalcolithic, differential access to resources may have involved less archaeological1y visible items such as staples. access to water, and control over labor, as it appears to have done at this time in Mesopotamia (Stein 1994)."
