M. Masson 'concluded that there was in Bactria a major political unit that extended its influences to Margiana and, possibly, to Aria and Sogdiana. The existence of a pre-Achaemenian Bactrian empire has been archaeologically proved through studies of the northern Afghanistan settlements of Altyn-Dilyar-depe, with its lofty citadel ringed with ramparts and bastions, Altyn-depe I with its keep, and Altyn-depe X with its summer and winter palaces. With their tall citadels raised on platforms and their defensive walls, such heavily fortified settlements as Altyn-Dilyar in the Farukhabad oasis or Altyndepe in that of Dashly, contrast sharply with the hand-made decorated pottery. This means that the culture originated at the latest in the mid-eighth century B.C.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_UzKok02][MAJIDBENAM_BR] <span style="color:purple">JR: According to Rapin, we could even start Koktepe II later than 750 BCE, around 650 BCE: 'Au vu de la minceur des couches de sol des cours fortifiées, la période de Koktepe II ne semble pas avoir duré très longtemps: un siècle au maximum, à partir, peut-être, de la seconde partie du VIIe siècle' [In view of the shallow depth of the soil layers of the fortified courtyards, the period of Koktepe II doesn't seem to have lasted for very long: a century at most, beginning, perhaps, from the second half of the 7th century].[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_UzKok02] </span>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Latest: c550 BCE[MAJIDBENAM_BR] Scythians prior to Persian conquest[MAJIDBENAM_BR] "As was the case for various earlier constructions, both monuments were abandoned during a period of nomad invasions, possibly in the sixth century BC.

For one, they tentatively assign these economic-political and religious areas to 'Scythes sédentarisés' (sedentarized Scythians) themselves. They also say that 'La période dite de "Koktepe III" apparaît sans transition chronologique aussitôt après la celle de "Koktepe II". L'organisation urbaine et architecturale fondamentalement nouvelle qui se manifeste alors pourrait correspondre à l'arrivée en Asie centrale des Achéménides' [The period called 'Koktepe III' appears without chronological transition immediately after that of 'Koktepe II'. The fundamentally new urban and architectural organization that is manifested at this point could correspond to the arrival in central Asia of the Achaemenids],[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_UzKok02] implying cultural continuity right up to the Achaemenid period.

Before the arrival of Iranian peoples in Central Asia, Sogdiana had already experienced at least two urban  phases.  The first was at Sarazm (4th-3rd m.

It has been possible to demonstrate the magnitude of links with the civilization of the Oxus as well as with more distant regions, such as Baluchistan.  The second phase began in at least the 15th century BCE at Kok Tepe, on the Bulungur canal north of the Zarafsan River, where the earliest archeological material appears to go back to the Bronze Age, and which persisted throughout the Iron Age, until the arrival from the north of the Iranian-speaking populations that were to become the Sogdian group.

The valley of the Zarafshan had already known an earlier urban phase at the site of Sarazm, a small distance upstream from Samarkand, but this phase had ended a millenium before. Kok Tepe declined rapidly, but Samarkand became for two millennia the greatest city of Sogdiana, and, with Merv and Bactra, one of the very great cities of western Central Asia."

They assign an economic-political function to area A and a sacred one to area B,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_UzKok02] and speculate that they could be the work of sedentary Scythians.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_UzKok02] The cultural context of Koktepe during this period differs from that of eastern Central Asia, as represented by the citadel of Ulug Depe.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_UzKok02][MAJIDBENAM_BR]There may be a case, based on similarities in architectural construction, for treating the areas around Samarkand and Padajatak-tepa (near modern-day Shahr-i Sabz) as part of this polity during this period. In an article on Samarkand, Grenet comments: 'C'est donc avec une totale surprise que, en 1991, la fouille mettait en évidence, partout sous les remparts achéménides tant de l'acropole que du plateau, un premier mur épais de 6 mètres relevant d'une tradition défensive et d'une technique différente: non à galerie intérieure, mais massif; bâti non en briques crues rectangulaires de gabarit régulier, mais en briques ovales plus grossières, "plano-convexes". Il apparaît maintenant que ce type de maçonnerie caractérise sur d'autres sites aussi la toute première phase de la construction urbaine dans les plaines de Sogdiane (Koktepe à 30 km au nord de Samarkand; Padajatak-tepa, la Nautaca des campagnes d'Alexandre, en Sogdiane méridionale près de Shahr-i Sabz) et dans leur appendice ferghanien (Ejlatan, Dalverzin-tepe)' [It was thus a total surprise when, in 1991, the excavation revealed, throughout the site beneath the Achaemenid ramparts of the acropolis as well as the plateau, a thick earlier wall of 6 metres, related to a different defensive tradition and a different technique: not with an interior gallery, but solid; built not with adobe bricks of a regular size, but of rougher oval-shaped, "plano-convex" bricks. It now appears that this type of masonry also characterizes the very first phase of urban construction at other sites of the Sogdian plain (Koktepe, 30 km north of Samarkand; Padajatak-tepa, the Nautaca of Alexander's campaigns, in southern Sogdiana near Shahr-i Sabz) and its Ferganian neighbour (Ejlatan, Dalverzin-tepe)].[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_UzKok02][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The transition between the period of the painted pottery (Koktepe I) and the period of the monumental courtyards (Koktepe II) needs further research, as the differences betwen the north-eastern and south-western trends of the early Iron Age cultures still need explanation."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_UzKok02][MAJIDBENAM_BR]With regard to the transition between Koktepe I and II, Rapin and Isamiddinov say that the first centuries of the 1st millennium BCE are represented throughout the site by an 'épaisse couche organique' [thick organic layer], suggesting that 'cette période pourrait avoir été celle d'une population semi-sédentaire, peut-être assez nombreuse, qui se serait installée à Koktepe avec du bétail' [this period could have been one of a semi-sedentary population, perhaps quite numerous, which would have been established at Koktepe with cattle].[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_UzKok02][MAJIDBENAM_BR]According to Claude Rapin, for "the complex question relating to the Early Iron Age in Central Asia" read this (and another 2001 work)[MAJIDBENAM_BR] Francfort, H. -P. 1989.

Both walls not only protected monumental buildings, but also encircled a large open area, probably for the surrounding population to shelter with their cattle when necessary. This conception is characteristic of Central Asian urbanism near the steppe areas (Francfor 2001), and is also apparent in later cities, such as Ai Khanum or Taxila-Sirkap."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_UzKok02][MAJIDBENAM_BR] "The sacred function of the monument, probably related to early Zoroastrianism (or at least to a local cult affiliated to the Indo-Iranian complex), is confirmed by the evidence of a ritual of foundation performed just before its construction."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_UzKok02][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Pre-Achaemenid period.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_UzKok02][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Edward Turner's interpretation of pre-Achaemenid Sogdiana (Koktepe in particular):[MAJIDBENAM_BR]'The essential tension was the sedentary population needed (their irrigated) fields for growing crops, nomads needed land for grazing. so the "strongly fortified courtyards" is a manifestation of this tension.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]another reason for fortification would be that wave/s of invasion/destruction had happened before:[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"By 1600 BCE, peoples carrying the Andronovo cultural package had displaced, if not destroyed, the Bactrian/Margiana towns".[MAJIDBENAM_BR]then the Yaz I replaced the Andronovo - UzKok01. (destruction then as well?)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]if the inhabitants within the UzKok02 courtyards were Scythians they had probably invaded then settled c750 BCE, presumably causing some destruction of the previous culture.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]an important line of evidence for invade/destroy/replace also is that it is likely that about 800 BCE the nomadic tribes around Central Asia began to use armies of horseback archers. the fact the sedentarized Scythians built fortifications must reflect the increased danger from the Steppe.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]their identity lasted until either the Achaemenid or until another wave of Scythians destroyed their culture c550 BCE'.</div></body></html>
