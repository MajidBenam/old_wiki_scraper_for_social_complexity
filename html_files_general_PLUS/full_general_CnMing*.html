While Emperor Taizu ruled as an autocrat, some Ming emperors left the governance of the nation in the hands of officials and eunuchs.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_CnMing*] The emperor presided over the central government in concert with various levels of chief ministers and imperial officials, and the central government structure was replicated on a smaller scale at the provincial level.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_CnMing*] Officials were recruited through an examination system.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_CnMing*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The period was marked by increasing openness to non-Confucian ideas and an increase in literacy among the lower levels of society.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_CnMing*] Intellectual culture flourished among the elites[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_CnMing*] and the publishing industry expanded greatly in the Lower Yangtze region.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_CnMing*] Novels, including <i>The Romance of the Three Kingdoms</i> and <i>Water Margin</i>, and the play <i>Peony Pavilion</i> were written in the Ming period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_CnMing*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The rapid growth of the international trading system along with foreign desire for Chinese porcelain and silk led to large increases in foreign trade and an influx of silver into the Ming economy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_CnMing*] In the later Ming period, trade conflicts impacted China's foreign silver supply, leading to massive deflation.
