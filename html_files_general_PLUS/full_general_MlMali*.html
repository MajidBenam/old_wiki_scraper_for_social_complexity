Niani, Mali's speculative first capital, has only furnished C14 dates from before or after the key 13th to 15th-century period. This indicates that, at best, it was a late imperial seat of power. The issue of ancient Mali's capital has thus been a matter of much debate - and is as yet unresolved. There is currently general agreement among historians that Mali's first centre(s) of power would have been located in the so-called 'Pays Manding', c.200km south-east of Sorotomo. There is, however, substantial historical evidence suggesting a rapid shift of power towards the north-east during the empire's apogee."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_MlMali*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Mande; Arabic ♥</b> mid-14th century onwards?

Although Ibn Battuta and Ibn Khaldûn maintain that this founding hero was converted to Islam, the Malinke oral tradition vehemently insists on his character as a 'pagan' magician and denies any conversion. But already Sundiata's son and successor Mansa Uli performed the pilgrimage during the reign of the Mamluk sultan, Baybars (658/1260-676/1277). Under his rule Mali expanded over the Sahel and took control of the trading towns of Waläta, Timbuktu and Gao, thus coming into a more direct contact with Islamized peoples than in the centuries before. From his reign onwards the royal pilgrimage became a permanent tradition among the mansas. The Islamic outlook of the empire took shape in the eighth/fourteenth century under Mansa Musa (c. 712/1312-738/1337) and his brother Mansa Sulaymän (f. 738/1341-761/1360) who encouraged the building of mosques and the development of Islamic learning. Ibn Battuta, an eye-witness, praised the zeal of the Malian Muslims in memorizing the Qoran and in attendance at the public prayers. The general feeling one has in reading his account is that Mali in the mid-eighth/fourteenth century was a country in which Islam had already taken root and whose inhabitants followed the main Islamic precepts. He does not mention any pagan religious practices and apart from the nakedness of women he did not observe anything prohibited by Islamic law." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_MlMali*] However, Niane [MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_MlMali*] writes that, when traveller Ibn Battuta visited this polity later in the fourteenth century, he noted that " the emperor also remained faithful to certain pagan customs, and Ibn Battuuta was shocked by many unorthodox practices. Apart from the presence of Arabs and the slight Muslim veneer, what happened at the court of the mansa differed very little from what might have been seen at the courts of non-Muslim kings, for example those of Mossi" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_MlMali*].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Genus ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion ♣ ♥</b>After the gradual decline of the Ghana Empire, the power vacuum left in the Sudanese region was filled with several smaller successor states, including the Sosso Kingdom.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_MlMali*] In the early 13th century CE, several Malinke chiefdoms from the Upper Niger region united against the Sosso and slowly aggregated into what would become the Mali Empire.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_MlMali*] This polity, also known as the Mandingo Empire,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_MlMali*] was the largest of the West African empires, and flourished from the early 13th to the late 14th/early 15th century, at which point it started to decline.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_MlMali*][MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_MlMali*] The apogee of the Mali Empire corresponds to the reign of Musa I of the Keita dynasty, the <i>mansa</i> (emperor) who reigned over 24 cities and their surrounding territories from 1312 to 1337.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_MlMali*] His empire extended from the Atlantic to Gao and the Niger Inland Delta, and from the southern Sahara to the tropical forest belt.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_MlMali*] Musa I is also famed for his patronage of Islam in Mali and for his lavish distribution of gold when he set off on a pilgrimage to Mecca in 1325.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_MlMali*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The kings of the Keita dynasty sat at the apex of a confederation incorporating smaller kingdoms such as Ghana and Mema.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_MlMali*] At its height, the empire comprised 12 provinces made up of smaller, village-centred clan units.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_MlMali*] The mansa (emperor) was thus a 'chief of chiefs', assuming the mantle of a supreme patriarch, and he could dispense justice personally.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_MlMali*] He received advice from the <i>griot</i>, chosen from the Kouyate clan, who was also his spokesman and the tutor of princes.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_42_MlMali*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The aristocracy formed around the Malinke warrior class,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_43_MlMali*] including an elite corps of cavalry.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_44_MlMali*] The empire maintained a strong army, with garrisons stationed in the main towns.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_45_MlMali*] The merchant class, known as Dyula or Wangara,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_46_MlMali*] formed settlements at the margins of the forest regions, such Kankan in modern-day Guinea, Bobo Dioulasso in modern Ivory Coast, and Begho in modern Ghana.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_47_MlMali*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The cities of Mali were cosmopolitan, inhabited by people of every occupation and from every province of the empire,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_48_MlMali*] and prospering from their participation in Trans-Saharan trade networks and the export of gold, ivory, salt and slaves.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_49_MlMali*] Their characteristic mudbrick architecture, known as <i>banco</i>, can still be admired today.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_50_MlMali*] This distinctive architectural style is one of many signs of Mali's legacy in the region, as its language, laws and customs spread through West Africa. In the 15th century, however, a long period of gradual decline began. Timbuktu was captured by the Tuareg in 1433,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_51_MlMali*] and a few decades of internal political struggles made it difficult for the emperors to maintain control over such a large region, leading to the contraction of the empire's territory.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_52_MlMali*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The empire was densely populated, with a reported 400 towns in the region and a compact net of villages near the trading city of Jenné.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_53_MlMali*] When the Andalusi diplomat Leo Africanus visited Niani in the 16th century, he described a thriving city of 'six thousand hearths'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_54_MlMali*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Mali Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Mali_1300CE: 1230CE-1399CE; Mali_1400CE: 1400CE-1410CE ♥</b>  Mali_1300CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_55_MlMali*] Mali_1400CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_56_MlMali*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  1284989: 1230CE-1399CE;  630713: 1400CE-1410CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Mande ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Mande ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Mande ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ African Religion ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Mande Religion: 1300CE; Islam: 1400CE ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition ♣ Islam: 1300CE; Mande Religion: 1400CE ♥</b></div></body></html>
