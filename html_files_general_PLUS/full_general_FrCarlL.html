In 752 CE, however, Childeric III (last of the Merovingian rulers) was deposed and they seized outright control of the Frankish realm.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_FrCarlL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_FrCarlL] With the new dynasty the capital moved east: Aachen, or Aix-la-Chapelle, became the main royal residence of the Carolingian monarchs until the empire began to disintegrate in the 9th century.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_FrCarlL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Charlemagne was the most powerful Carolingian king, but after his death in 811 CE, the empire stopped expanding. The year 811 also marked the beginning of a rise in sociopolitical instability that resulted ultimately in a complete split of the kingdom. After the 843 CE Treaty of Verdun, the Carolingian lands were partitioned among Louis the Pious' sons: Charles took the west, Louis the German the east, and Lothair took the Frankish territory between these two regions.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_FrCarlL] The Treaty of Meerssen (870 CE) resulted in the absorption of the central Frankish realm into West and East Francia, forming a boundary that even now endures as the border between France and Germany.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_FrCarlL] The empire was briefly reunited from 884 to 887 under Charles the Fat,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_FrCarlL] but as a rule the Frankish lands remained politically fragmented from the mid-9th century to 987 CE, when power passed to the Capetian Dynasty.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_FrCarlL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]This polity represents the late period of Carolingian rule, from 840 to 987 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the Carolingian era, the lands under Frankish control grew considerably and an administrative system was developed in order to govern this large territory.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_FrCarlL] One official position that first appeared in this period was the <i>missus dominicus</i> (king's representative), who could be sent out from the court to inspect the counties and pass on the king's decrees.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_FrCarlL] Decrees were sometimes set down in documents called capitularies.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_FrCarlL] However, capitularies post-dating 843 CE are only found in West Francia, and they stopped being produced there too after the death of Charles the Bald in 877.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_FrCarlL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_FrCarlL] This might suggest that the office of <i>missus dominicus</i> did not exist beyond that date and did not survive the rise in instability.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Carolingian kings ruled in an essentially decentralized fashion like the Merovingians before them. Control over the regions was delegated to fief holders, often hereditary vassals of the king.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_FrCarlL] The king ruled by decree[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_FrCarlL] and under Charlemagne (r. 800-814 CE) counties were established as the basic unit of governance.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_FrCarlL] Counts were responsible for enforcing local laws, dispensing justice and setting taxes.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_FrCarlL] By 850 CE, almost every county in West Francia also had a viscount, who assisted the count in his duties.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_FrCarlL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]During Charlemagne's reign, the population of Gaul probably reached 5 million[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_FrCarlL] but levels of urbanization were low in these supposed 'dark ages' of medieval France: no town reached over 10,000 inhabitants between the 8th century and 1000 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_FrCarlL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Carolingian Kingdom ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Carolingian_900CE: 840CE-986CE; Carolingian_1000CE: 987CE-987CE ♥</b>  Carolingian_1000CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_FrCarlL] Carolingian_900CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_FrCarlL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  439157: 840CE-986CE;  266670: 987CE-987CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Germanic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Old Frankish ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Christianity ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Catholicism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Sect ♣ Roman Catholic ♥</b></div></body></html>
