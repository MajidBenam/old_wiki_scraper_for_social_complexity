Three phases have been distinguished, each marked by a different dynasty named after its founder or most significant early leader (thus the Kidinuids, Igihalkids and Shutrukids). This is the period when the title 'king of Susa and Anshan', as it is expressed in Akkadian texts, or 'king of Anshan and Susa'. according to the usage of the Elamite sources, is attested."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_IrMElm1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Peak Date ♣ 1158 BCE ♥</b> Shutruk-Nahhunte invaded Babylonia and overthrew the Kassite king Zababa-shuma-iddina in this year and probably gave the throne to his son Kutir-Nahhunte. He bought a lot of bounty back to Elam after the battle, including the victory stele of Naram-Sin and probably the Law Code of Hammurabi.

While details of the transition between these two eras are lacking, the onset of the Middle Elamite period is usually put at c. 1500 BC, its end at c. 1100 BC."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_IrMElm1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Between 1550 (the end of the sequence of sukkal-mah and of legal texts from Susa) and 1350 BC, Elam experienced its own dark age. However, this phase was different from the one attested in the rest of the Near East. In reality, this presumed 'dark age' appears to be so more in terms of textual evidence, rather than historical developments."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_IrMElm1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]1420 BCE - Knowledge of the beginning of the Middle Elamite Kingdom is limited. Names of probable kings are known from the fifteenth and fourteenth centuries but there is no defined point between the intermediate period and the start of the Middle Elamite Kingdom. 1420 CE is chosen as a representative starting point, rather than the date of a particular event. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_IrMElm1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]1100 BCE - The Middle Elamite Kingdom ended when the Babylonian army, led by Nebuchadnezzar, defeated the last Middle Elamite king, Hutelutush-Inshushinak and seized Susa. Nebuchadrnessar reported in a letter that Huteleutush-Inshushinak disappeared, but bricks bearing his name found at Tal-i Malyan give some credence to the suggestion that he retreated to Anshan after defeat. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_IrMElm1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ unitary state ♥</b> It is known that kings appointed regional governors. The title King of Anshan and Susa infers greater centralised control of Elam than in previous and later periods, but it is likely that there were periods when there was greater regional power. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_IrMElm1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Without exaggeration, the Elamite federated system of government can be considered as perhaps the earliest formal federalism on a large scale in history."

In this period it became embroiled in Mesopotamian politics and became part of the supraculture of Mesopotamia. At the same time Elamite kings held the title of king of Anshan and Susa.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_IrMElm1] The kingdom is commonly split into three phases: the first before 1400 BCE; the second, 1400-1200 BCE, which was characterised by intermarriage with the Kassites; and the third, 1200-1100 BCE, characterised by war with the Kassites.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The First Period lacks the evidence of the later periods, but can be seen to be a substantial state, where the kings held the title of king of Anshan and Susa, even if it is not clear how much control they exerted over Anshan. The kings of the First Period had local governors and diplomats, craft and cult organisation, and could wage war against the Babylonians. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_IrMElm1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Second Period has a comparative wealth of evidence, mostly royal inscriptions from building or dedicatory texts. During this period, the empire expanded and many building works were undertaken, including the construction of the new city al-Untash Napirisha. This period also saw the Elamites becoming increasingly involved in Mesopotamian politics. There were many marriages between Elamite princes (the Igihalkids) and Kassite princesses. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_IrMElm1] The "Berlin letter", an important text, names four marriages between Elamite princes and Kassite princesses. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_IrMElm1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Third Period involved military battles with Babylon, which had been annexed by Assyria. in 1158 BCE, the Elamite king Shutruk-Nahhunte invaded Babylonia and overthrew the Kassite king Zababa-shuma-iddina, probably giving the throne to his son Kutir-Nahhunte. The Middle Elamite Kingdom ended when the Babylonian army, led by Nebuchadnezzar, defeated the last Middle Elamite king, Hutelutush-Inshushinak and seized Susa in revenge for taking their god and invading their kingdom. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_IrMElm1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Kings of this period were commonly referred to by the title 'king of Susa and Anshan' in Akkadian and 'king of Anshan and Susa' in Elamite.  It is a period characterised by this unity between the highlands, Anshan, and the lowlands, Susa. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_IrMElm1] A powerful bureaucracy had religious and secular influence in the government. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_IrMElm1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The population for the entire empire is unknown, but the largest settlement is estimated at between 1,500-6,000 people during the early period, 2,750-11,000 people in 1300 BCE, and 5,000-20,000 in 1200 BCE.</div></body></html>
