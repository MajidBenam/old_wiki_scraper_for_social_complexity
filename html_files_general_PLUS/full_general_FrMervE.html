Written references to royal edicts are known from 614 CE onwards, but earlier royal legislation has not survived.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_FrMervE] Merovingian kings had the authority to appoint dukes and counts as well as bishops, who were often 'royal servants with no known connections with their sees'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_FrMervE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]From 622 CE onwards the basic territorial divisions of the Merovingian Kingdom were Neustria (centred on the Seine and Oise rivers and associated with the <i>Pactus Legis Salicae</i> law code),[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_FrMervE] Burgundy (where the <i>Liber Constitutionum</i> was developed), and Austrasia (by the Rhine and Meuse, which came to possess its own mayor of the palace[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_FrMervE] and followed the Lex Ribvaria).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_FrMervE] A fourth area, Aquitaine, had a special status due to its distance from the royal centres and was under less direct Merovingian control.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_FrMervE] In the earliest times, Merovingian administration beyond the Rhine (in modern-day Germany) was less elaborate than that imposed further to the west: counts sent to rule in the east did not attempt to introduce literacy, currency or Christianity to their domains.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_FrMervE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Merovingian Kingdom ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Franks_Merovingian_500CE: 481CE-543CE ♥</b>  Franks_Merovingian_500CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_FrMervE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  337777: 481CE-543CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Germanic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Old Frankish ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Christianity ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Catholicism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Sect ♣ Roman Catholic ♥</b></div></body></html>
