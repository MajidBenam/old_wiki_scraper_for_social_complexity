[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_MlJeJe1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"It appears that permanent settlement first became possible in the upper Inland Niger Delta in about the third century B.C.E. Prior to that time, the flood regime of the Niger was apparently much more active, meaning that the annual floodwaters rose higher and perhaps stayed longer than they do today, such that there was no high land that regularly escaped inundation. Under these wetter circumstances, diseases carried by insects, especially tsetse fly, would have discouraged occupation. Between 200 B.C.E. and 100 C.E., the Sahel experienced significant dry episodes, that were part of the general drying trend seriously underway since 1000 B.C.E. Prior to that time, significant numbers of herders and farmers lived in what is today the southern Sahara desert, where they raised cattle, sheep and goat, grew millet, hunted, and fished in an environment of shallow lakes and grassy plains."

And they were non-coercive settlements. Groups congregated by choice. This is an instance of transformation from a rural to an urban society that did not establish a hierarchical society and coercive centralized control... The process in the delta and at Jenne-jeno in particular, was one of 'complexification' rather than centralization."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_MlJeJe1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ ♥</b> unknown</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣  suspected unknown  ♥</b> "Permanent settlement in the delta, resulting in the formation of tells (large mounds consisting of the accumulated remains of ancient settlements), was initiated by people who entered the region during the last 500 years BC."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_MlJeJe1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Jenne-jeno II ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ Sahel Tell Culture ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣ [1,500,000-2,500,000] ♥</b>km squared.

It was continuously inhabited between 250 BCE and 1400 CE. 'Jenne-jeno I' refers to the period of earliest occupation, from 250 BCE to 50 CE. During this time, the site's inhabitants fished, gathered wild plants, hunted, and cultivated rice (as well as millet and sorghum). They also made and used pottery, and smelted, smithed and used iron, though they probably imported the raw material for the latter from far afield.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_MlJeJe1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]There does not seem to be enough data to reconstruct Jenne-jeno's political or social organization at this time, but even for later periods, there is a lack of archaeological evidence for 'coercive' centralized control or the development of hierarchical social structures.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_MlJeJe1] It is also unclear how many people were living at Jenne-jeno or at the surrounding sites. However, one of the site's excavators, Roderick McIntosh, does say that the founding population was probably not inconsiderable, and expanded rapidly.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_MlJeJe1]</div></body></html>
