However, there is no record for only one center, which would have controlled the whole central Anatolia.

Old Assyrian merchant settlement is visible in most of the sites dated to the Middle Bronze Age[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_TrBrzMD]. But even more proof of cosmopoliticy during the examined period is gained from the Assyrian archives excavated in Kültepe-Kaniš[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_TrBrzMD]. Most of the cuneiform tablets give simple business information (who bought how much of what), but through these descriptions archaeologists and other scientists have a better idea of what was happening during these centuries, that precede the Hittite Empire period[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_TrBrzMD].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br>Middle Bronze Age period (later MBA) is the time when Assyrian merchants established their trade colonies in the region of Central Anatolia. What is most fascinating about the period of Assyrian Colonies is that a writing system was then first introduced to the Anatolians, and thus the historical era for this region begins. Middle Bronze Age involved a big step in terms of civilization for Anatolian kingdoms, which were then just standing in front of empire unification.According to geomorphological studies, the landforms and landscapes of Central Anatolia, particularly Konya Plain, looked more or less the same during MBA as they do now. However, pollen studies proved the climate was a lot wetter during MBA and forests extended to the margins of the plain (Arbuckle 2012: 465). There were many kingdoms in the area in question, dependent on one another through a vassal treaties. The kingdoms that have been archaeologically identified are Kanish, in the Kayseri region (site called Kültepe), Hatti (later Hittite Hattush) on the Bogazkoy site, and Purushanda (alternatively Burushattum, Purushattum), which is believed to be now known as the site of Acemhoyuk (but there is still an on-going discussion on this hypothesis). The Wahusasna kingdom is known only from written records (Bryce 2006: 24).[MAJIDBENAM_BR]While investigating the chronology of the MBA period, the Assyrian list of eponyms is useful - the names of the eponyms are included in some of the cuneiform texts from Kanesh. Scientists divided MBA in Anatolia into three periods:MBI cca. 2000-1850 B.C.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]MBII cca. 1850-1650 B.C. (the actual Assyrian Colony Period, which is divided into two periods based on data from Kültepe-Kaneš: 1850-1750 B.C. visible in mound Stratum 8 and karum strata II; 1730-1700 B.C. visible in mound Stratum 7 and karum strata Ib)MBIII cca. 1650-1500 B.C.  (Açıkkol et al. 2009: 30).[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The peak date of MBA seems to be represented by the period visible in karum strata II, the times from before Zalpa conquest of Kanesh, when the long distance trade was really prosperous. Direct proof of this development can be seen in the presence of a huge amount of cuneiform texts, which come from Assyrian archives from karum-Kanesh (Dercksen 2004: 137-139).Cuneiform texts represent mostly personal letters exchanged between Assyrians from Ashur and Anatolian colonies, economical contracts, loan agreements and other similar texts (Bryce 2006: 27). While a lot is known about the economic and personal life of MBA people thanks to the nature of known texts, there is very little information about gods (they come up only as witnesses in economical transactions), rituals, history and social life. A few later, Hittite texts inform about last rulers of Kanesh, Pithana and his son Anitta (Topçuoğlu 2010: 25). These texts bear information about some conquests and disagreements between Anatolian kingdoms that were fighting for one anther, probably in order to gain very beneficial geographical position on long distance trade routes (Bryce 2006: 30).[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Bronze production was dependent on trade. Anatolia is very rich in gold, silver and copper, with absolute absence of tin, which had to be transported through the city of Ashur, from far away deposits in modern Afghanistan. Besides tin, Assyrian caravans transported huge amounts of woolen textiles that were often valued higher than precious metal (Barjamovic 2005). In return, they hoped for payment in pure silver and copper (Dercksen 2005). These two materials were a kind of currency used in MBA period in Anatolian trade. Bigger ingots, if needed, were crushed into smaller pieces to meet the demands of the trade exchange value. During the MBA period, trade was the main accelerator of intercultural exchange of thoughts and social accomplishments (Veenhof 1982). Many colonies were established then - texts inform us about 21 such places, while archaeological evidence may confirm only 3 of them (karum-Kanesh, Merchant settlement in Hatti (Bogazkoy site) and in Acemhoyuk (Bryce 3006). These colonies were called karum, which seem to correspond with the bigger settlements near city mounds like in the case of karum-Kanesh and wabartum, which are believed to represent smaller settlements on route, established in order to keep passing caravans safe.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Assyrians found Anatolia particularly interesting because of its stable political situation, which fostered security for merchandise transported with caravans. On the other hand, Anatolian rulers found the trade to be beneficial, and started to impose taxes on merchants in exchange for safe passage. These taxes were an inconvenience that the merchants tried to bypass in two ways: either through smuggling merchandise into en route cities, or by choosing the so called “narrow track”, if it was safe (Barjamovic 2011). There is very little information about punishments, law and justice, that would explain the mechanism of judicial system. But on the other hand. some cuneiform texts write about court cases, often describing consecutive court cases. Surely though, smuggling was punished with jail (Bryce 2006).[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Anatolian rulers saw advantages in controlling strategic trade points on long distance routes. Besides taxes, some of merchandise was traded in such places. Moreover, merchants had to stay somewhere, eat something and etc., so the reception facilities appeared and created profit as well. As the rulers desired to become richer and gain more control over neighboring kingdoms, there was an increase in the amount of border misunderstandings. Best examined archaeological examples of such conflicts (which obviously crossed borders) is conflagration of some major sites, like Kultepe or Acemhoyuk in the end of karum II period, and their revival in the beginning of karum Ib period. These events are linked with passages about the ruler of Kussaras, Pithana, and his son Anitta, who had recaptured city of Kanesh from Zalpian king Uhna. Subsequently, during Anitta’s reign the city was fortified (which is confirmed archaeologically) and trade colonies were restored (these activities date to the karum Ib period) (Hamblin 2013).[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Due to the nature of known cuneiform texts (personal and economical mostly) and scientific focus directed only on bigger city settlements, and not hinterland ones, there is very little trace of what rural settlements may have looked like. What seems to be sure is that pastoralism was more profitable than agriculture - this was because of secondary animal products, such as milk, wool etc.  (Arbuckle 2012). Thanks to field walking research we do have data about existence of many rural sites, but none of them are under investigation.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Similar situation occurs in the case of rituals. Cuneiform texts do not inform us about any, but in excavated burials there are traces of two different traditions, presumably reflecting Assyrian and native Anatolian. Burial gifts do not show many differences though, which seems to reflect the level of cultural integration between these two cultures, and possibly with some other, like Luwians and Hurrain, who participated in the trade network as well. This unification of culture is visible also in similar building traditions, employing stone foundations with mudbrick walls. Furthermore, some cuneiform texts testify marriages across nations.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]To sum up, MBA period in central Anatolia was time of lively intercultural contacts and social development, thanks to exchange of technological and social inventions between Anatolia and Mesopotamia. The first introduction of writing system influenced bureaucracy and palace administration, which then developed into an imperial system. The need for tin, in order to make bronze alloy, motivated merchants engage in long distance trade and host foreign traders. Stable political situation had attracted Assyrian merchants in the beginning of second millennium, but in XVIII century BC, due to increasing amount of conflicts between kingdoms, this trade started to crush and finally ended. After that, the Hittite Empire arose, and completely changed the political map of what used to be Anatolia. With a new polity, rulers and a new nation, a new came along. Iron was much easier to obtain, because only one ingredient was needed, so the long distance trade stopped, and new ideologies (military conquest) started to run international connections. But we may surely say the that Middle Bronze Age Assyrian Colony period created the foundation for the development of the Hittite Empire.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Hereditary Monarchy[MAJIDBENAM_BR]International Relations present  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_TrBrzMD][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Taxation present  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_TrBrzMD][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Army Recruitment present  On the obligatory service terms due to the land possession[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_TrBrzMD].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Public works present These works might have regarded buildings, harvesting, and other similar works, not exactly specified[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_TrBrzMD][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Transport infrastructure present  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_TrBrzMD][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Taxation[MAJIDBENAM_BR] By the local elites  present  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_TrBrzMD][MAJIDBENAM_BR] By the state officials  present  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_TrBrzMD][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Type of taxes[MAJIDBENAM_BR] Staple  present [MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_TrBrzMD][MAJIDBENAM_BR] Labor  present  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_TrBrzMD][MAJIDBENAM_BR] Currency  absent[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Taxes are imposed on[MAJIDBENAM_BR] Land  present  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_TrBrzMD][MAJIDBENAM_BR] Property present  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_TrBrzMD][MAJIDBENAM_BR] Trade present [MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_TrBrzMD][MAJIDBENAM_BR] Income  present  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_TrBrzMD][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Degree of taxation  unknown  For example 1/120 of a whole silver cargo, or merchandise like textiles, tin, wool and so on.

According to letters which refer to such activity, there was a route that either started or passed through the Lower Country.
