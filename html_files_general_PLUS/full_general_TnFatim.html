Missionary efforts were successful in Ifriqiyya in North Africa, and area centred around modern-day Tunisia, where Fatimid propaganda was taken up by the Kutama Berbers."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_TnFatim] Began as revolutionary movement against Abbasids in Syria. "Naturally, Islmaili religious claims and Fatimid political ones were both bitterly opposed by the Abbasids, forcing the Fatimid/Ismaili leadership to flee their first base in Syria in 909. They seized Ifriqiya - modern Tunisia and Eastern Algeria - took over the trans-Saharan gold-and-slave trade, built two great capitals - first Kairouan, then nearby Mahdiyya - and set up an autonomous state far from the reach of Baghdad."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_TnFatim] Ismaili Shias rebelled against Aghlabid rule in Tunisia, 909 CE, then expanded former Aghlabid domain to Morocco. After a number of attempts, with assistance of Berber tribes, annexed Egypt in 969 CE.

The leader of the movement, Ubaydallah, proclaimed himself caliph in 910. The Fatimids conquered Sijilmassa, Tahert, Qayrawan, and much of the rest of North Africa. They destroyed the Khariji principalities. Warfare also destroyed the trade routes and led to the rise of nomadism. The Fatimids conquered Egypt in 969. Moving their capital to Cairo, they abandoned North Africa to local Zirid (972-1148) and Hammadid (1015-1152) vassals." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_TnFatim][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In Salamiyya, Syria, around 900 CE an Abd Allah gained leadership of the da'wa and claimed the Imamate <i>(does this mean he claimed to be Hidden-Iman or al-Mahdi?)</i> but not all the da'is accepted this; in 903 CE he was forced to flee to North Africa where a friendly da'is had an established propaganda network.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_TnFatim] In 903 CE the da'is for North Africa began the conquest of Ifriqiya.

The credit for that move should be given to al-Mu'izz's son and successor, under whose rule the Egyptian capital would rapidly emerge as a brilliant centre of the arts and learning. Prince Nazir, who took the name al-Aziz B'illah, 'Mighty by God', upon his ascension in 975, publically announced his succession by riding out to offer the prayer for the Feast of the Sacrifice under the mizalla, a parasol shaped like a bejewelled shield hung from the point of a lance held by a courtier. No Fatimid caliph is know to have previously used one, and it seems likely that the Fatimid mizalla was synonymous with and ultimately derived from the shamsa or shamsiyya used earlier by the Abbasid caliphs as a symbol of authority."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_TnFatim][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Fustat remained Egypt's economic and administrative centre.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Arabic ♥</b> Arabic was the main language.

After a failed uprising against the Sunni Abbasids in Syria, the head of the Ismaili Shi'a religious movement - who claimed descent from Muhammad's daughter Fatimah by way of her descendent Ismail - fled to Tunisia. There, with the help of local Berber warriors, he 'seized Ifriqiya - modern Tunisia and Eastern Algeria - took over the trans-Saharan gold-and-slave trade, built two great capitals - first Kairouan, then nearby Mahdiyya - and set up an autonomous state far from the reach of Baghdad'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_TnFatim] From there, the Fatimids conquered much of North Africa, extending their rule into Egypt. The effective end of the Fatimid Caliphate occurred at the end of the 11th century (though the Caliphate remained nominally intact for nearly another century). At this time, a series of Fatimid viziers increased their control of the military and, ruling from their own palaces, turned the imam-caliph into a nominal figurehead.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_TnFatim] Over many years in the final century, the Fatimid state experienced a long decline marked by incompetent viziers.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_TnFatim][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Although relatively little is known about the Fatimid bureaucracy during the early period (909-969 CE), we can say that it did not have a vizier.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_TnFatim] In Tunisia, the Fatimids used slave eunuchs to command army and naval forces, and, following the precedent of previous Islamic governments, founded cities as administrative and military centres and seats for their courts.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_TnFatim] Suggesting the presence of a highly capable full-time bureaucracy, one of their purpose-built cities, the second capital Mansuriyya (948-975 CE), was supplied with fresh water from a distant spring via an aqueduct 'modelled on the Roman system at Carthage'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_TnFatim][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In 969 CE, the Fatimids conquered Egypt under a military general called Jawhar. This brought the total land area under Fatimid control to 2.4 million square kilometres,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_TnFatim] and the new capital city, al-Qahira (Cairo), was founded in 975 and remained the capital under the fall of the dynasty in 1171.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_TnFatim] In Egypt the vizier, a staple of Islamic Egyptian government, was introduced to Fatimid professional administration, which may suggest that the Fatimids retained much of the lower administration present during the Ikshidid Period as well. Heads of administration are known for the military, treasury, religion, missionary activities, and the judiciary.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_TnFatim] Before 1073 CE, the vizier was a slave who did not have military powers. Between 1073 and 1121, he became the military chief and effectively replaced the iman-caliph as head of government.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_TnFatim] The imam-caliph retreated into a palace that contained a harem run by a 'hierarchical corps of eunuchs'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_TnFatim][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Provinces were ruled through vassals. After the foundation of Cairo, North Africa was 'abandoned' to the Zirid (972-1148 CE) and Hammadid (1015-1152 CE) Dynasties.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_TnFatim] Within Egypt, two cities enjoyed a measure of self-rule: Fustat was governed by a <i>wali</i> (governor)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_42_TnFatim] and Alexandria also had its own budget and chief judge.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_43_TnFatim] The rest of Egypt was divided into seven districts,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_44_TnFatim] which may have been commanded by <i>amirs</i> (military governors). Towns with markets would have a <i>muhtasib</i>, who oversaw shopkeepers' and artisans' activities and ensured that religious law was correctly observed.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_45_TnFatim][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Fatimids repaired and improved dams and canals[MAJIDBENAM_REF_46_TnFatim] and Egypt grew exceptionally prosperous under their rule, especially before the mid-10th century. Al-Qahira had eight public baths,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_47_TnFatim] a caravanserai (<i>funduq</i>) for foreign merchants,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_48_TnFatim] and possibly the most famous market in the Islamic world at the time, called the Market of the Lamps (Suq al-Qanadil).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_49_TnFatim] The 10th-century geographer al-Muqaddasi described Suq al-Qanadil as 'the marketplace for all mankind ... It is the storehouse of the Occident, the entrepot of the Orient.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_50_TnFatim] Another contemporary traveller, Nasir-i Khusraw, reported that in Cairo the shops were 'all the sultan's property' and leased to the shop owners,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_51_TnFatim] underscoring the power of the caliphs and their dedication to public works.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The population of the Fatimid Caliphate peaked at about 12-13 million in 1000 CE, but subsequently declined as territory was lost to about 4 million in 1100 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_52_TnFatim] By the end of the 10th century, the population of the caliphate was roughly equivalent to that of Egypt. The city of Fustat, close to Cairo, had approximately 120,000 residents, even after the fire of 1168, and multiple sources report multi-storey residential homes with up to seven levels.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_53_TnFatim]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Fatimid Caliphate ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Fatimid_900CE: 909CE-999CE; Fatimid_1000CE: 1000CE-1099CE; Fatimid_1100CE: 1100CE-1171CE ♥</b>  Fatimid_1000CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_54_TnFatim] Fatimid_1100CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_55_TnFatim] Fatimid_900CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_56_TnFatim]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  603941: 909CE-999CE;  2523188: 1000CE-1099CE;  1148669: 1100CE-1171CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Afro-Asiatic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Semitic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Arabic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Islam ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Shia Islam ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Sect ♣ Ismalii ♥</b></div></body></html>
