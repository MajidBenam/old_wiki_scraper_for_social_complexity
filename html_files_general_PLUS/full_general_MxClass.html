Here, we are interested in the phase of its prehistory known as the Classic or Early Classic period (c. 100-649 CE). This period was characterised by sophisticated forms of artistic expression and high levels of craft specialisation, pronounced differences between the material culture of the wealthier classes and that of the poorer ones, and trade networks extending farther and farther across the wider region. In the Basin of Mexico, Teotihuacan was the dominant centre, and the presence of Teotihuacano artefacts outside of the Basin testifies to its far-ranging influence.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_MxClass] Indeed, Teotihuacan was the largest city in the world, with a population of about 100,000[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_MxClass] or 125,000.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_MxClass][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Relatively little is known regarding Teotihuacan's political organisation. There is no consensus on the existence of a ruler's palace at the site, nor have royal burials or depictions of individual rulers been found. The site has yielded representations of elite personages, but they are usually shown in groups, partaking in processions, and wearing masks, suggesting that power was shared or distributed: perhaps, the city was governed by a committee of representatives from different interest groups, and/or spokespeople for some or each of the city's thousands of apartment compounds.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_MxClass]</div></body></html>
