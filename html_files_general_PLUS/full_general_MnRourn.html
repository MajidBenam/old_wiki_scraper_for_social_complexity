It is difficult to know how much real power he wielded, but he skilfully exploited the internal difficulties of the rapidly disintegrating W ei state. He established matrimonial relations with both the Eastern and Western Wei, and at times was an effective power broker between contending Chinese factions." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_MnRourn] The Rouran tended to raid the Wei, with periods of alliance. There were several strategic marriage alliances between the two polities. However, this might be too unstable (because of the raiding) to code as 'alliance'?</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Xianbei Confederation ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b> "Subsequent to the death of Tanshikhuai, his brother came to power, followed by a nephew, and then an unrelated leader (Kebineng), but unity was ephemeral and by A.D. 235 the Xianbei broke into a series of smaller polities, eventually reemerging as the Toba (northern) Wei polity."

[...] In 555, the ruler of the Western Wei empire handed over the remaining few thousand Rouran to the Turks, all of whom (except children under sixteen) were put to cruel death."

Unfortunately we do not know what Juan-juan was like. In spite of repeated attempts to reconstruct them on the basis of Chinese transcriptions, Juan- juan proper names show no trace of being Turkic, nor can they consistently be explained from Mongol. It is probably safe to say that within the perimeter of the Juan-juan state a number of partly unrelated languages were in use, and that the Turks, together with the political power, inherited the linguistic status quo. Scattered but convincing data support such a hypothesis."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_MnRourn] "Since the Eastern Hu as a whole appear to be of Mongolic ancestry, the Rouran, too, were presumably Mongolic in language. The name Rouran (medieval Chinese ñzhu-ñzhän) resists any convincing etymology."

Between about 300 and 550 CE, it was under the control of the Rouran. Though these began as nomadic pastoralists like their predecessors the Xianbei and Xiongnu, there is evidence that by the sixth century CE they had transitioned to a settled, agricultural way of life, and from shamanism to Buddhism.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_MnRourn] At their peak, they ruled over an empire comprising around 4,000,000 squared kilometers,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_MnRourn] with a population of no less than 500,000.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_MnRourn] This empire was divided into an eastern and a western wing, each ruled by a silifa, who were subordinate to the paramount ruler or khagan.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_MnRourn] For ease of organisation, both the population and the army were divided into groups of hundreds and thousands.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_MnRourn]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Rouran Khaganate ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Rouran_300CE: 300CE-399CE; Rouran_400CE: 400CE-499CE; Rouran_500CE: 500CE-555CE ♥</b>  Rouran_300CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_MnRourn] Rouran_400CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_MnRourn] Rouran_500CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_MnRourn]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  915071: 300CE-399CE;  915071: 400CE-499CE;  5564283: 500CE-555CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Mongolic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Eastern Mongolic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Mongolian ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Buddhism ♥</b></div></body></html>
