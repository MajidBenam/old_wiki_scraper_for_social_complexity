It was found to be located near modern Boğazkale, Turkey, within the great loop of the Kızılırmak River. Hattusa exerted dominating influence upon the civilizations of the 2nd and 1st millennia BC in Anatolia and Northern Syria. The palaces, temples, trading quarters and necropolis of this political and religious metropolis provide a comprehensive picture of a capital and bear a unique testimony to the disappeared Hittite civilization. The city's fortifications, along with the Lion Gate, the Royal Gate and the Yazılıkaya rupestral ensemble with its sculptured friezes, represent unique artistic achievements as monuments.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Hattusa was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1986[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_TrBrzL2].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Nesite; Luwian ♥</b> And many others.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_TrBrzL2]  "The official language of the kingdom was an Indo-European language called Nesite, which we commonly refer to today as the 'Hittite' language."
