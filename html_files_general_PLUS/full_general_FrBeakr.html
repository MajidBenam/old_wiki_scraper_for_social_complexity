These Bell-Beaker tumuli often formed the nuclei for continuing clusters of such barrow-burials in succeeding centuries. [...] Rather than representing a coherent migration of a distinctive people, the Bell-Beaker phenomenon is better seen as the outcome of the kind of processes discussed at the end of Chapter 5: as part of the breakdown of traditional social structures and the emergence of more mobile ways of life that began in northern Europe after 3000 BC. [...] The name given to this phenomenon comes from the characteristic drinking vessel with its inverted bell-shaped profile, which carries incised decoration in horizontal zones around the body."

[...] In some regions Beaker practices were adopted wholesale and marked a sharp break with earlier traditions. In others there was some continuity: For example, final burials in some megalithic tombs contained Beaker material. Settlements belonging to the makers of Beaker pottery are elusive, and it has been suggested that they led a relatively mobile way of life, probably associated with pastoralism, though probably, like Corded Ware, Beaker material was used by communities practicing many economic strategies."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_FrBeakr]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Atlantic Complex ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ Chalcolithic; Late Neolithic ♥</b>  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_FrBeakr]  "The following are the more important of the archaeological cultures, which fall within the timespan of the Late Neolithic: the south-eastern European Late Gumelnitsa, Salcutsa, and the Late Tripolye culture of the Ukraine, the central European Corded Ware, Globular Amphora, BodrogkeresztUr, Baden, late Funnel Beaker, and Bell Beaker cultures."

Some were composed of small, dispersed communities with 10 to 20 domestic units,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_FrBeakr] but larger groups could gather into fortified settlements: Los Millares in Spain was home to 1000-1500 people.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_FrBeakr] The Beaker culture is also associated with demographic growth in Europe, as the small-scale polities moved into previously marginal lands.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_FrBeakr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The spread of this material culture has been interpreted as evidence for a wide set of circulation networks, fuelled by elite demand for prestige goods.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_FrBeakr] The items may have been exchanged on the occasion of social rituals consolidating the power of emerging leaders.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_FrBeakr] In this interpretation, the archaeologically visible spread of Beaker culture would not be tied to immigration but to the emergence of mobile ways of life,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_FrBeakr] with independent leaders affirming their belonging to a wider cultural sphere through the consumption and display of valuable items.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_FrBeakr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Beaker people built on the legacy of their early Neolithic predecessors, reusing and modifying ceremonial structures such as Stonehenge.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_FrBeakr] However they distinguished themselves through their burial customs, preferring single burials in grave pits to passage and gallery graves. In certain areas, such as the Iberian Peninsula or southern France, they occasionally reused ancient megalithic structures.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_FrBeakr]</div></body></html>
