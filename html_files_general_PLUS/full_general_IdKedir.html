The latter rapidly overshadowed its "twin": it was the first Indonesian kingdom to develop stratified territorial administration, it became known for the organization of its armed forces, and it even introduced bureaucratic officials specifically tasked with the management of the polity's water resources.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_IdKedir]  Kediri does not appear to have collapsed: rather, in the early thirteenth century, the cente of power shifted to Singhasari, with the foundation of a new dynasty.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_IdKedir][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Kediri was ruled by a king, who was assisted by bureaucratic officials. Moreover, as already mentioned, Kediri was the first known Indonesian state to develop stratified territorial administration: more specifically, the polity was organized into three levels, the village, the cluster of villages, and the state.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_IdKedir] This suggests that there were officials in charge of administrating both village clusters and individual villages.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]According to McEvedy and Jones,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_IdKedir] Indonesia had a population of four million in 1100 CE. Given the fact that Kediri occupied a small portion of the archipelago, it seems reasonable to infer a population size of a few hundred thousands.</div></body></html>
