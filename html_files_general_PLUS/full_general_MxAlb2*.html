Neither conquered the other (based on distinct material culture and architectural styles) but did trade with one another.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_MxAlb2*] In addition, there is evidence for a "Oaxaca barrio" at Teotihuacan, with pottery styles dating to the MA II-III phases.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_MxAlb2*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ MxAlb1L ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b> The Zapotec state had developed into a state by the beginning of this period. The capital remained at Monte Albán, but the territory expanded even further, both within and outside of the Valley of Oaxaca. New conquered territories included: Miahuatlán, Cuicatlán, Tututepec, Ocelotepec, Chiltepec and Sosola.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_MxAlb2*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ MxAlb3A ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b> Distinctive pottery styles suggest that there were around 518 communities in the Valley of Oaxaca during this period, which is 227 fewer than the previous period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_MxAlb2*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Monte Albán ♥</b> Monte Albán remained the largest, most elaborate and most heavily populated site in the Valley of Oaxaca.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_MxAlb2*][MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_MxAlb2*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Zapotec ♥</b> “…the iconography and hieroglyphic writing of Monte Albán I suggest that we are dealing with people who spoke an early version of Zapotec and practiced an early form of Zapotec religion.”[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_MxAlb2*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic Family ♣ Otomanguean ♥</b> Both the Zapotecan (Zapotec and Chatino) and Mixtecan (Mixtec, Cuicatec and Trique) languages belong to the Otomanguean language family, which also includes: Otopamean, Chinantecan Popolocan, Huave, Amuzgo and Manguean language groups.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_MxAlb2*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language Genus ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious Tradition ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Sect ♣ ♥</b>The Monte Albán II period runs from 100 to 200 CE. The Zapotec state, which had formed in the previous (Late I) phase,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_MxAlb2*][MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_MxAlb2*] was now fully established with the capital at Monte Albán. The Zapotecs extended their territory further during this period, to include the rest of the Valley of Oaxaca as well as territories much further afield (including Miahuatlán, Cuicatlán, Tututepec, Ocelotepec, Chiltepec and the Sola Valley).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_MxAlb2*][MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_MxAlb2*] The place names recorded in the 'conquest slabs' at Monte Albán can still be identified in some cases (as they are still called by those names) and may indicate that the territorial limits of the Zapotec state during this period were around 85-150 kilometres from Monte Albán.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_MxAlb2*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The first evidence for 'rulers', identified in hieroglyphic inscriptions, comes from this period, and the earliest ruler's portrait dates to around 100 CE. Nobles were also ritual specialists and officiated human sacrifices.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_MxAlb2*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Evidence for conquests includes the burning of conquered settlements, the presence of Zapotec material culture and propaganda (including a skull rack displaying the heads of conquered people) and references to defeated areas carved on the 'conquest slabs' displayed in Building J on the Main Plaza of Monte Albán.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_MxAlb2*] Monumental construction flourished during this period, with standardized temples, palaces and ball courts built around the paved Main Plaza at Monte Albán. Secondary sites, such as San José Mogote, imitated the constructions at Monte Albán with similar (although smaller) temples and central plazas.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_MxAlb2*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Valley of Oaxaca Settlement Pattern Project estimates a decline in population by up to 32% (from roughly 50,000) during this period, based on the abandonment or shrinkage of some settlements (even though this was in part due to the nucleation of the population at larger centres such as Monte Albán).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_MxAlb2*] Archaeologists Joyce Marcus and Kent Flannery, however, suggest that this perceived decrease in population is partly due to the very high estimates given by the Settlement Pattern Project for the previous phase.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_MxAlb2*]</div></body></html>
