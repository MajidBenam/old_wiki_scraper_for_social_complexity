Cameron suggests that local rule would probably have remained strongest in the remote Eastern districts of Elamite territories, sc. the region of modern Fars." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_IrElmCP] <span style="color:purple">JR: This view may be changing. We asked Wouter Henkelman about the degree of centralization in Elam in the first half of the 1st millennium BCE as a whole. He told us that 'the ascending view is that Elam was an organised and centralised state up until the Assyrian invasions' (of the mid-7th century BCE).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_IrElmCP] For this reason, I've coded for scholarly disagreement.</span></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Elam - Inshushinak Period ♥</b> Inshushinak Dynasty.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b> "Elamite documentation reveals that the Sutrukid dynasty (the last dynasty of the 2nd mil- lennium b.c.) continued beyond the reign of Hutelutus-Insusinak with kings Silhina-hamru- Lagamar, Humban-numena II, Sutruk-Nahhunte II, and Sutur-Nahhunte I. Texts excavated at Ansan indicate the existence of kings, but no titles are given: Aksir-nahunte and Aksir- simut (both contemporaries of Sutruk-Nahhunte II). There are contextual, paleographic, and onomastic reasons to believe that Hutran-Tepti, Att-hamiti-Insusinak, and Humban-nikas I, son of Humban-tarah, ought to be dated in the period 1000-750 b.c. Finally, after a break of a few years, the name Hallutas-Insusinak appears during the mid-8th century b.c. (paleo- graphic and filiation arguments). These royal names partially fill a gap of some 300 years in the Mesopotamian documentation for the kings of Elam. The royal titulature of these indi- viduals does not, therefore, speak in opposition to an independent Ansan."

If a unified state, the capital could have been Susa, which was probably still an important centre. The site was still occupied between 1000 and 725/700 BCE.

These historically obscure centuries represent a transitional phase between the Middle Elamite and Neo-Elamite Kingdoms. Following M.-J. Steve, we have split the period at 900 BCE, resulting in a 'crisis phase' between 1100 and 900 and an early Neo-Elamite period between 900 and 744 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_IrElmCP][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In his 'Elamite war' of 1125-1104 BCE, the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar I invaded Elam and forced the Elamite king Hutelutush-Inshushinak to abandon Susa.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_IrElmCP][MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_IrElmCP] After this date, there is a drastic reduction in written sources for the history of Elam, both in Mesopotamian documents (either Babylonian or Assyrian) and in inscriptions and tablets from Elam itself.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_IrElmCP] The traditional interpretation has been that there was a disintegration of centralized authority in Elam between the Babylonian invasion and the reemergence of well-attested Elamite kings in the 8th century BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_IrElmCP] However, some scholars question this, pointing out that systematic archaeological excavation of many Elamite sites has yet to be carried out.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_IrElmCP] Further, the gaps in the Mesopotamian historical sources, instead of reflecting the disappearance of Elam as a political entity, may be a function of the political crises and famine that affected Assyria and Babylonia during this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_IrElmCP][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Due to a scarcity of evidence, the political organization of Elam in the centuries between c. 1100 and 744 BCE remain unclear. Some archaeologists and historians argue that Elam split into multiple autonomous chiefdoms after the Babylonian invasion,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_IrElmCP] while others believe it maintained its unity as an organized and centralized state.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_IrElmCP] Documents excavated at the site of Anshan dating to the 11th century BCE hint at the survival of some form of royal administration, at least in the highlands.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_IrElmCP][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Secure population estimates for the area under Elamite control in this period are lacking.</div></body></html>
