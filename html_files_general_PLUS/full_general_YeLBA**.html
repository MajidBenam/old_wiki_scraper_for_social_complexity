Here, we are interested in the phase of its prehistory known as the Late Bronze Age (c. 1200-801 BCE). Yemeni Bronze Age communities relied on farming and animal husbandry, though bronze itsems, shells, semi-precious stones, and obsidian all suggest that trade networks were well established at this time.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_YeLBA**][MAJIDBENAM_BR]No serious works on the estimates for the area and population in the Neolithic and Bronze Age Yemen.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_YeLBA**] Similarly, no speculation could be found in the literature regarding possible forms of political organisation prevalent at the time; from an archaeological perspective. However, it is worth noting that some sites were larger than others, and that the larger sites differed from smaller ones in their layout as well as their size,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_YeLBA**] suggesting perhaps a hierarchical relationship between the two types. Moreover, some sites included buildings that were significantly larger than others, and that stood apart from the other buildings as well; though their precise function remains difficult to ascertain, certain features, such as benches along the walls, suggest public use.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_YeLBA**]</div></body></html>
