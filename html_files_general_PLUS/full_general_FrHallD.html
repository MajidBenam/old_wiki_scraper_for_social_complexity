[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_FrHallD][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Senones in Champagne: "From the beginning of the fourth century, numerous Celtic groups, organized under the authority of aristocratic chiefs, were established in northern Italy.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_FrHallD][MAJIDBENAM_BR]While from 900-600 "a north-south axis of exchange gradually superseded all other axes" it involved mainly "the eastern part of the North-Alpine Complex." During the sixth century BC, the founding of the Greek colony at Massalia introduced exotic products to "chiefs that were located directly on the principal communication routes." Thus "In the framework of a prestige economy, they gained in power, reinforcing their control of exchange with the Mediterranean civilizations, monopolizing redistribution, and finally subjugating neighbouring chiefs. In this manner, centralized political units of a scale previously unknown in Europe were formed." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_FrHallD][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The princedoms "disintegrated in the fifth century BC" when other communities "situated at the north-western periphery of the area held by the princedoms" became more powerful: the Tessin community; Hunsruck-Eifel region; Aisne-Marne region; Berry region."

The number of elite burials also fell, but those which have survived intact display extraordinary riches.

Even if we reject centres such as the Heuneburg as truly urban, despite the concentration of wealth, trade and industry on them (the social structure would have prevented the full de- velopment of exchange as we know it on later sites), we still have a number of different urban types; administrative centres, market centres, colonies, and entrepôts for long-distance trade including ports-of-trade. Each of these classes would have its own characteristics in terms of who was resident, what public amenities were present, and in the spatial layout of the town." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_FrHallD]  "In less developed forms we may detect centralised control on the sites of the late Hallstatt period of the sixth century BC, sites such as the Heuneburg and Mont Lassois in western Europe."

It coincides with the North Alpine complex, extending over modern-day central and southern Germany, northern Italy, and Switzerland.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_FrHallD][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Hallstatt D period (c. 600-475 BCE)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_FrHallD] saw the intensification of processes that had been occurring throughout the Hallstatt era. Some polities disintegrated while others gained power. Thus, the number of hillforts decreased but they grew in size;[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_FrHallD] Mont Lassois is a prime example.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_FrHallD] Chiefs controlled the prestige economy at the local level, trading with their Mediterranean counterparts. Extreme social differentiation can be observed in burials;[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_FrHallD] the lavish Vix Burial, a cairn 42 metres wide and 6 metres high associated with the site of Mont Lassois,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_FrHallD]  includes gold and bronze objects as well as prestigious imports.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]This period was also marked by the rise of urban centres specializing in administrative and mercantile activities, including colonies and entrepôts established for the purpose of long-distance trade.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_FrHallD] Population estimates are more easily accessible for the Hallstatt D period. The Heuneburg, a hillfort reaching c. 100 hectares in the mid-6th century BCE, may have been home to about 5000 inhabitants.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_FrHallD]</div></body></html>
