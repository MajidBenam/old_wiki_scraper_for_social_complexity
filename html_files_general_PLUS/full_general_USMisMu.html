"Beginning A.D. 300-400, the bow replaced the atlatl in most regions" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_USMisMu][MAJIDBENAM_BR] In the Mississippian region (Midwest and Upland South) the transition from atlatl to bow was "relatively rapid because dart points disappear from the archaeological record" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_USMisMu][MAJIDBENAM_BR] Introduction of the bow in the Mississippi region decreased social complexity because it caused the collapse of the Hopewell system, the abandonment of mound centers and alliance-exchange relationships [MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_USMisMu][MAJIDBENAM_BR] Bow enabled a new bow and native crops subsistence strategy which lead to a movement to and the effective exploitation of previously marginal lands and "household autonomy" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_USMisMu][MAJIDBENAM_BR] There followed an economic intensification and population growth which eventually "packed the landscape with settlements." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_USMisMu]</div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR] 400 CE[MAJIDBENAM_BR] 500 CE[MAJIDBENAM_BR] 600 CE<div> Late arrowheads appear. "This transition to small, thin, triangular or triangular corner-notched points has long been accepted as evidence of the bow, but variation in the morphology of late arrow point types suggest that this transition was governed by social and historical factors that varied across these regions." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_USMisMu][MAJIDBENAM_BR] Late arrowheads may indicate the technological development of fletching as they are less heavy and thick than the early arrowheads. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_USMisMu][MAJIDBENAM_BR] First evidence of intergroup violence appears in the archaeological record (arrowpoints embedded in skeletons in individual and group burials). [MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_USMisMu][MAJIDBENAM_BR] No evidence for an increase in social complexity and hierarchy or deviation from the "trend toward household autonomy" at this time. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_USMisMu][MAJIDBENAM_BR] "For the first time, there is evidence, in the form of group and individual burials with embedded arrow points, of the bow as the primary weapon of intergroup violence." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_USMisMu][MAJIDBENAM_BR] "In Middle Woodland times there isn’t much evidence for warfare."  "Later, after about A.D. 600 there is more evidence (scalping, embedded arrow points)."  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_USMisMu][MAJIDBENAM_BR] "Population growth, reduced access to resources, sedentism, and the desire to avoid conflict made the high costs of intensified food production more attractive." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_USMisMu]</div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"trail networks also are important, and some of the historic east-west ones cross near Cahokia."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_USMisMu][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Cahokia "controlled a critical choke point in trade routes that spanned the midcontinent" an idea that goes back to Brackenridge (1813 CE).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_USMisMu][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The greatest environmental hazard would have been a late summer Mississippi River flood similar to the one that took place in 1993. A rise in the river at that time of the year simultaneously drowned crops, prevented easy fishing in shallow ponds, and ruined food stored in underground pits. Floods attributable to severe storms, including excessive water funnelled into the floodplain by creeks that drain the uplands, certainly caused localized disasters much like they did a century ago before effective flood-control measures were put in place." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_USMisMu][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"No other major site was as advantageously situated. Cahokia was located in what was by far the widest expanse of land suitable for settlement in the American Bottom. More people could live there than anywhere else ... The high ground where Cahokia was located was bordered on the north and south by large tracts of low-lying land that received the waters of different upland streams."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_USMisMu]</div></body></html>
