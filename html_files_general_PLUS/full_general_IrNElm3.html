Neo-Elamite phase c.1000 to conquest of Babylonia by Cyrus the Great in 539 BCE. Neo-Elamite II ends 646 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_IrNElm3] The uncertainty in the dates here is due to disagreement about the status of Elam between the Assyrian sack of Susa in 647/6 and before the destruction of the Assyrian city of Nineveh in 612. The traditional interpretation has been that Elam 'became an Assyrian province until the fall of the Assyrian empire and the destruction of Nineveh in 612 BC'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_IrNElm3] However, Pierre Amiet, Pierre de Miroschedji, M.-J. Steve and Francois Vallat 'suggest that a Neo-Elamite renaissance - a state of independence rather than subjection to any rival, whether Babylonia or Media - occurred in the wake of Assurbanipal's destruction of Susa'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_IrNElm3] Potts commented in 2012 that 'Evidence that Elam became an Assyrian province soon after Assurbanipal's destruction of Susa is equivocal at best. Nor is it clear what role Elam played vis-a-vis the growing power of Babylonia or that of Media'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_IrNElm3] It seems that despite the 'ferocity' of Assyrian attempts to eradicate 'Elam as a political and cultural entity',[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_IrNElm3] the polity continued to exist in diminished and fragmented form after 646 BCE. Carter and Stolper also note that 'contrary to earlier assumptions, the destruction of Susa in 646 B.C. had little effect on the evolution of ceramic or other artifact styles'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_IrNElm3]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ {quasi-polity; confederated state} ♥</b><span style="color:purple">JR: I've coded for scholarly disagreement here. Wouter Henkelman is 'personally convinced' that Elam remained a centralized state after the Assyrian invasions, and that 'it prospered on account of the disappearance of Assyrian pressure (military but especially economic) after the fall of Nineveh. Not everyone subscribes to this view: Daniel Potts still believes in a fragmented state after the 640s. I personally do not see any convincing argument for this'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_IrNElm3]</span>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]After the Assyrian sack of Susa in 646 BCE, 'It looked as if Elam as a state were completely destroyed, but several kinglets still held out in the mountain strongholds, then descended into the lowlands as soon as the Assyrians went away; and at last the Assyrians went for good'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_IrNElm3] Some time after about 625 BCE, 'one of the Elamite pretenders seems to have achieved the unification of the devastated kingdom. Later, under the next Babylonian king, Nebuchadnezzar II, war broke out between Babylonia and Elam (596/5), leading to the capture of Susa by the Babylonians; but, as can be gleaned from Jeremiah 49, the attention of the Babylonian king was riveted on other more important political matters elsewhere, and it seems that Elam again regained its independence (Jeremiah 49.39)'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_IrNElm3] However, writing more recently, Waters gives us a more fragmented picture: 'It has become the norm to envisage contemporaneous, Neo-Elamite kings ruling independent principalities throughout southwestern Iran - not only in Susiana - in the roughly 100 years between the sack of Susa and Cyrus the Great's conquest of the Medes'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_IrNElm3]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Neo-Assyrian Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Achaemenid Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Elamite ♥</b> "The Elamite written language was used as the official language in the bureaucracy for a long time, rivaling the Sumerian and Akkadian languages even over a thousand years later, during the Old Persian Empire of the Achaemenids."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_IrNElm3]</div><div class='meatypart'></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ isolate ♥</b> Elamite is a language 'of unknown linguistic affiliation'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_IrNElm3] but may be related to the Dravidian languages of South Asia.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_IrNElm3][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<a href="/w/index.php?title=File:Mesopotamia_and_Elam_map_(Waters_2000).png" class="image"><img alt="Mesopotamia and Elam map (Waters 2000).png" src="/w/images/4/4b/Mesopotamia_and_Elam_map_%28Waters_2000%29.png" width="479" height="522"></a>[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_IrNElm3][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Our Neo-Elamite III period begins in 647 BCE, the date of the invasion of Elam and sack of the ancient city of Susa by the Neo-Assyrian king Ashurbanipal,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_IrNElm3] and ends in 539 BCE. This date marks the capture of Babylon by the first king of the Achaemenid Persian Empire, Cyrus the Great, who must have been ruling in Susa by 540 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_IrNElm3] By this time, the Elamite civilization had occupied the highlands of the south-western Iranian plateau and the fertile lowlands of the Susiana plain for over two millennia.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The traditional interpretation of this period has been that Elam effectively ceased to exist as an independent state after Ashurbanipal's invasion, becoming a province of Neo-Assyria until Assyria's own fortunes declined several decades later.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_IrNElm3] However, some scholars believe that Ashurbanipal's destruction of Elam may not have been as complete as he claimed.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_IrNElm3] The archaeologist Pierre de Miroschedji has argued that by 625 BCE, Elam's government was restored and that the royal chancellery was active at Susa.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_IrNElm3] The extent of Babylonian and Persian influence on Elamite politics in the century before c. 540 BCE is also a matter of ongoing debate.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_IrNElm3][MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_IrNElm3][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Secure population estimates for the area under Elamite control in this period are lacking.</div></body></html>
