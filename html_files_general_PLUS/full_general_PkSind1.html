After the replacement of the Habarri by the Soomras the Sind was largely independent, although they saw the Fatimids as the ultimate religious authority. An exception to this is the period of five years during which the Sind paid tribute to Mahmud of Ghazni. After a long period of independence until 1228 CE portions of the territory were annexed by the Delhi sultanate, leading to the Sind being made a vassal of Delhi from 1297 CE to 1317 CE. A chaotic period of civil war and three claims to kingship occurred from 1317 - 1352 CE. This period coincided with the rise of the Samma Jams.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_PkSind1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b>km squared. *</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Bania; Mansura; Thatta; Muhammed Tur; Thatta ♥</b>  Bania: 811-892 CE; Mansura: 892-1026 CE; Thatta: 1026-1241 CE, Muhammed Tur: 1241-1317 CE; Thatta: 1317-1351 CE   [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_PkSind1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The original capital of Mansura was sacked in 1026 CE, when the Soomra dynasty moved the capital to Thatta. Shifts in river courses resulted in a transfer of the capital to Muhammed Tur during the years 1241 CE-1317 CE. After declaring independence from Delhi a period of instability took place, with some semblance of authority claimed from the former capital of Thatta.

However, in 836 CE, the Abbasid Caliphate lost control of its western territories, and Sind plunged into a civil war.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_PkSind1] Here we consider the period going from the middle of the ninth century, when the Habari lineage became rulers of an independent Sind, to the middle of the thirteenth, when the Samma dynasty seized power. Throughout these centuries, Sind experienced a peaceful power transition from the Habari to the Soomra, in 1010, annexation to the Delhi Sultanate, and a long civil war caused by political instability resulting from Mongol invasions.
