He apparently had to wage a difficult struggle against the central Parthian government."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_IrSasn2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Empire from 226 CE (with God-king and Achaemenid ideology)[MAJIDBENAM_BR] King Papak's adopted son Ardashir inherited the crown. He was from the family of Sasan.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_IrSasn2][MAJIDBENAM_BR] The first Sasanian 'King of Kings' was Ardashir I who was crowned in 226 CE at Ctesiphon.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_IrSasn2][MAJIDBENAM_BR] Early Sasanids in their imperial ideology "considered themselves from the lineage of the gods" and used the Achaemenid title "King of Kings."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_IrSasn2][MAJIDBENAM_BR] Size of court and bureaucracy increases between Ardashir I and Shapur I (240-270 CE). Military success under Shapur I (240-270 CE) and Shapur II (309-379 CE). [MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_IrSasn2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Rise of Zoroastrian Church under Kerdir 274 CE[MAJIDBENAM_BR] Under Bahram II (274-293 CE) "the Sasanian kings lost much of their religious power as caretakers of the Anahid fire temple to Kerdir, who became the judge of the whole empire. ... from this point on, the priests acted as judges throughout the empire, and court cases were probably based on Zoroastrian law except when members of other religious minorities had disputes with each other."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_IrSasn2][MAJIDBENAM_BR] Zoroastrian priest Kerdir "began the persecution of the religious minorities in the empire, such as the Jews, Christians, Manichaeans, Mandeans, and Buddhists. ... Mani ... was imprisoned and put to death in 276 with the blessing (and to the relief) of Kerdir."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_IrSasn2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Status quo from 294-325 CE (Zoroastrian control)[MAJIDBENAM_BR] <i>presumably the situation is the same under kings Narseh (293-303 CE) and Hormizd II (303-309 CE) and during the infancy of Shapur II when "the court and the Zoroastrian priests ran an empire that was secure and stable enough structurally and administratively to survive without a strong monarchy"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_IrSasn2]</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Long reign of Shapur II and rise of court/bureaucracy[MAJIDBENAM_BR] Under Shapur II, power of the nobility and priests increased substantially.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_IrSasn2] <i>Does this imply at some point following the church of Kerdir and his persecutions the influence of priests diminished - perhaps due to the rise of the bureaucracy/court which may have accellerated during the infancy of Shapur II?</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR] Time of Shapur II has been referred to as a golden age.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Violence begins from 379 CE[MAJIDBENAM_BR] An inscription relates that Ardashar II (379-383 CE) purged "the great men and holders of authority to reduce their power."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_IrSasn2] The sophisticated, centralised bureaucracy was now "under the control of the priests" and its chief priest, with Kingship relegated to the status of a secular institution.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_IrSasn2] <i>Ardashar may have purged a court/bureaucracy which had become over-mighty during the long (70-year) reign of Shapur II. This would have favoured the Zoroastrian priests.</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR] The kings that followed Ardashar II (379-383 CE) "all met a violent end."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_IrSasn2] <i>that appears to mean up to 420 CE: Shapur III, Wahram IV, Yazdgird I, Shapur IV, Khosrau the Usurper (?).</i> <i>this elite conflict reflects a power-struggle between the court/bureaucracy and the Zoroastrian church.</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]recognition of Nestorian Christianity 410 CE; ends with usurper 420 CE[MAJIDBENAM_BR] Yazdgerd I (399-420 CE) called "the sinful one"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_IrSasn2] by Zoroastrian literature because he went against the wishes of the Zoroastrian priests.[MAJIDBENAM_BR] the 'secular' kings become powerful enough to challenge the priests. Under Yazdgerd I (399-420 CE) Christianity was officially recognized.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_IrSasn2][MAJIDBENAM_BR] "first synod of the Nestorian Church was convened in 410" during reign of Yazdgerd I (399-420 CE).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_IrSasn2] "Persian Christianity became officially recognized and the Nestorian Patriach resided at the royal city of Ctesiphon; he and the Jewish exilarch became responsible for their coreligionists."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_IrSasn2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Persecution of Christians and Jews from c.420 CE[MAJIDBENAM_BR] Bahram V (420-438 CE) and Yazdgird II (438-457 CE) persecuted Christians<div> "Bahram V continued and intensified the persecution of Yazdagird's last days."

Khusrau I (531-579 CE)[MAJIDBENAM_BR] Khusrau I (531-579 CE) promoted minor nobility and reduced the power of aristocrats and their estates. Deghans became tax collectors. "For the first time, the power of the landed nobility was restricted and all the taxes were in the hands of the king."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_IrSasn2][MAJIDBENAM_BR] Khusrau I is credited with wise leadership and is known as "Plato's philosopher king."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_IrSasn2] In 570s CE Sasanian Empire was "at the apex of its glory and power, headed by a philosopher king" (Khosrau I).[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Instablity from 579 CE[MAJIDBENAM_BR] Hamizid IV (579-590 CE), who followed Khosrau I, had many enemies at court, killed many of the nobility and was harsh to the priests.[MAJIDBENAM_BR] Hormizd IV deposed 589-590 CE by general and nobility who put on the throne his son, Khusrau II.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_IrSasn2][MAJIDBENAM_BR] Khusrau II forced to flee to Byzantium for the years 590-591 CE by Bahram but recruited an Armenenian army to regain the throne.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_IrSasn2][MAJIDBENAM_BR] Kushrau II was deposed by nobility and priests in 628 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_IrSasn2] Khosrau II (590-628 CE) was forced to seek shelter in Byzantine Hierapolis against a challenger king, Wahram Chubin, who minted coins 590-591 CE. Khosrau II regained the throne (purges?) and then the empire reached its greatest territorial extent. Khosrau II was deposed by priests and nobility in 628 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_BR] Kavad II (628-630 CE) conducted a fratricide, killing all the male heirs in the Sasanid family, and was assassinated.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_IrSasn2][MAJIDBENAM_BR] By 630s CE the empire was in confusion, had disintegrated into regional power-bases and internal conflict when Khuzistan fell to Caliph Umar.

This affected the great trade route from the ports on the Indian Ocean via Mecca and Medina to the Mediterranean port of Gaza. It was used by much of the trade in incense and spices. And as if that were not sufficient this South Arabian ruler, who had close political alignments with Persia, had the narrow navigable channel leading through the route from Bab al-Mandab closed with the aid of a chain.

Its population peaked at about 22 million at around 600 CE a time when the Empire was disintegrating.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The long reigns of Kavad I (499-531 CE) and Khusrau I (531-579 CE) saw many reforms, such as to the tax system and the military. Khusrau I is credited with wise leadership and is known as "Plato's philosopher king."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_IrSasn2] Khusrau I (531-579 CE) promoted minor nobility to official positions and reduced the power of aristocrats, placing tax collection in the hands of officials directly under his own control.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_IrSasn2] Khusrau I also made some important structural reforms to the military which removed the Commander-in-Chief (Eran-Spahbad) and divided the empire into four regions, each under the control of a regional field marshal (Spahbads).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_IrSasn2] This change enabled the Sassanids to more quickly respond to the external threats of invasion.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]After the high point of Khusrau I internal instability became the norm and the ruling dynasty had almost wiped itself out by the time the Arabs conquered the last Sassanid stronghold at Persis in 650 CE.
