Buyids or the Buwayhids was the dynasty who came from a people called the Daylamites. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_IrBuyid]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternative names ♣ Daylam State; Buyid Dynasty; Buwayhids; Dailamites; Reign of the Daylam; Dawlat al-Daylam ♥</b> There are several alternative spellings of Daylam and Buyid which are used throughout literature. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_IrBuyid] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_IrBuyid] Reign of the Daylam; Dawlat al-Daylam. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_IrBuyid]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Peak Date ♣ 983 CE ♥</b> The reign of Adud al-Duala from his take over of the Baghdad arm of the state, to his death. The Daylam state was nearly unified under one leader . Adud al-Duala was the first to term himself Shahanshah, King of Kings. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_IrBuyid][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Buyid history can be chronologically divided, roughly, into two divisions. The first half-century, up to the death of Adud al-Dawla, greatest of the Buyid rulers, in 372/983, is one of growth and consolidation when the political initiative was firmly in the hands of the princes of the ruling dynasty. From that point, however, the Buyids were on the defensive, especially in Iraq and central Iran, and political initiative passed to the hands of groups of soldiers and administrators who strove to manipulate their nominal rulers in their own interests." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_IrBuyid][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Adud al-Dawla's "rule in Fars was something of a golden age for the province as Adud al-Dawla made it the basis for his imperial schemes and, realizingthat the prosperity of the area was fundamental to his plans, took active steps to encourage both agriculture and trade."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_IrBuyid]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 932-1062 CE ♥</b> 932 CE is the probable date of 'Ali b. Būya's capture of the town of Karaj. It was the first of the areas of land that he conquered. From this town he was able to expand to regional control, by taking Fars; then to much greater control of large areas of Iraq and Iran. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_IrBuyid][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Buyid State was plagued throughout it's existence by succession battles. After the death of 'Adud al-Duala, a fight for the succession took place. Abu Kalijar managed to bring unification back again briefly, but his unexpected death led to further disintegration of the Daylam state, at which point foreign powers began to conquer areas of Daylam land. The empire diminished until in 1062 the Daylam heartland of Shīrāz was taken by the Saljuqs. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_IrBuyid]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ confederated state ♥</b> The Daylam State existed in a kind of military feudal system. The Dailamites were natural warriors and a military hierarchy had emerged which was used to rule the people under Buyid control. 'Ali b.Būya took confiscated land and gave it to his generals in lieu of payment. This system had a hereditary element.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The power system was further complicated by 'Ali b. Būya appointing his brothers as kings of areas of the empire. Rukn al-Daula ruled Isfahāhan and Ray. His coins suggest that he was sole ruler in this area since they contain only his name and the caliphs. Mu'izz al-Daula, the youngest brother, was placed in command of Buyid interests in Khūzistān, but only as a representative of 'Ali b. Būya. His coins contain his brother's name, as well as his own and the caliphs. Therefore, there existed a partially independent, partially hierarchical kingship system within the Daylam State. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_IrBuyid][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Furthermore, there existed the Caliphate in Baghdad. The Caliphate were considered religious leaders chosen by God to rule the Islamic world. They had political power by nature of their religious power. 'Ali b. Būya did not seek to overthrow the 'Abbāsid Calliph at Baghdad; instead he treated with him to gain recognition as viceroy, although he never paid the agreed tribute. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_IrBuyid] Since the Buyid dynasty was in control of Baghdad it has been suggested the the calliph were the pawns of the Buyids. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_IrBuyid] There continued to be several exchanges between the caliph and the ruler of the Daylam state to establish the state of power throughout the Buyid dynasty. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_IrBuyid][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Once 'Adud al-Daula had unified the Empire it existed as a confederated state with one ruler and was governed by a network of Buyid princes and other tribal leaders. There were also a number of vassal states which ruled themselves, though acknowledged the overlordship of the Buyids. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_IrBuyid]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ alliance ♥</b>Daylamites were foot soldiers but "a purely Daylamite army was not really effective since they had to find allies, usually Turks, sometimes Kurds, who could provide the cavalry to make a balanced fighting unit."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_IrBuyid][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Marriage links were an important way of consolidating alliances and links through the female line were more important than in much of Islamic society. This was especially true in the Buyid kingdom of Rayy, where traditional Daylamite customs seem to have been less affected by Islamic norms than in Fars or Iraq."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_IrBuyid][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"the alliance of Buyid princes and Farsi landowners ... was to be the foundation of the Buyid state"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_IrBuyid][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Buyid and Kakuyid contenders had often actually welcomed the Seljuks as a means of defeating internal enemies."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_IrBuyid]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Abbasid Caliphate I ♥</b> Origin region: "Iranian plateau where this alliance with the local civilian élite was a major source of strength for the dynasty. Only in Baghdad, with its powerful Turkish soldiers and its growing religious tensions, was there serious local resistance to their rule.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_IrBuyid] Core region: Fars. The Buyid period was "a golden age when Fars had been the wealthy centre of an empire."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_IrBuyid]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity; elite migration ♥</b> The ruling dynasty were from "the northern Iranian provinces of Gilam and Daylam ...

They remained isolated, ruled by kings who took pride in the preservation of old Iranian styles and beliefs."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_IrBuyid] However, the Buyids "were careful to show their attachment to Islam, even when they tried to revive ancient political glories."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_IrBuyid] Perso-Islamic: "the synthesis that had been developed since the early Abbasid period, bringing ancient Iranian, pre-Islamic ideas of kingship into an Islamic context. The tenth century had witnessed the heyday of this synthesis, as under ethnically Iranian dynasties like the Buyids ancient titles like shahanshah (king of kings) were revived."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_IrBuyid] Also, Buyids "openly favoured the Shi'ites, giving them appointments, allowing them to celebrate their festivals, paying handsome sums to Shi'ite poets and littérateurs."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_IrBuyid]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣ [3,000,000-3,500,000] ♥</b> km squared.

These three cities were the capitals of the three areas of kingship of the Buyid brothers. When 'Adud al-Duala took over Mesopotamia, Shiraz became the capital, although 'Adud al-Duala never returned there and remained in Baghdad alongside the calliph. Fars continued to be the heartland of the empire, with all civil servants being drawn from there. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_IrBuyid]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Persian; Arabic ♥</b> Persian was the mothertongue, the first Buyid rulers were probably not fluent in Arabic, but Adud al-Daula was known as an Arabic poet.

Ali b. Buya, a soldier in the Abbasid state, began taking territory by forced after being removed from his position as administrator of Karaj. By 934 CE, he had reached Fars. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_IrBuyid] In 945 CE the Buyids claimed Baghdad and Basra creating for themselves a stable base of power in Mesopotamia.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_IrBuyid][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Buyid ruler was known as an amir or shahanshah, the latter "more a recognition of seniority within the family than an office with authority".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_IrBuyid] The Buyids were essentially a provincial military aristocracy with an army composed partly of Daylamite infantry and slave Turkish cavalry. The regiments of the Buyid Princes often fought one another while the central government increasingly became ineffectual. "The Buyid state was divided into several appanages, of which Shiraz and Baghdad were the most important, each held by a different member of the family."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_IrBuyid][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In theory the Buyid amirs were governors under the Abbasid caliph who remained in Baghdad with powers to appoint religious officials,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_IrBuyid] and continued to be symbolically important (in Iraq) appearing on coinage and grants of land. Although Baghdad was the most important political, economic  and religious center, whose amir's chief secretary of the bureaucracy was formally granted the title of vizier[MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_IrBuyid], Fars was the heartland of the empire, with all civil servants being drawn from there.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_IrBuyid] The Buyids replaced previous established bureaucratic families with Christians, Jews, and Zoroastrians.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Buyids paid their military using iqta holdings whereby "in lieu of salary an amir would be granted the right to collect the taxes of a given area. An iqta could thus vary in size from a whole province to much smaller subdivision, to a single town or village." However, "Under the Buyids, this system was widely credited with economic disaster, as absentee amirs sought to reap the swiftest possible profits before their iqta was removed them."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_IrBuyid]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Buyid Confederation ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Buyid_1000CE: 932CE-1062CE ♥</b> Buyid_1000CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_IrBuyid]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  1150375: 932CE-1062CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div></body></html>
