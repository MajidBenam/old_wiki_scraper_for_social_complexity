In the early period (987-1150 CE), the area under the control of the Capetian monarchs was relatively restricted in comparison to the late period (1150-1328 CE), which saw a massive expansion in territory and increasing urbanization.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_FrCaptE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Capetian monarchs ruled their kingdom via decree. Louis VI (r. 1108-1137 CE) was recognized as the legitimate ruler by his vassals and, after the early 12th century, the great lords of France generally submitted to Capetian authority.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_FrCaptE] However, the dynasty had less power outside the region of Paris and the Counts of Bois and Troyes were arguably more powerful than the king in some respects. The Capetians drew their legitimacy from their stronger links to the Catholic church.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_FrCaptE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Before Philip II (r. 1180-1223 CE), government was very simple and closely linked to the king's court, which was still itinerant, moving wherever the king went.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_FrCaptE] At the core of the French king's government were a few major officials with household titles (chancellor, seneschal, butler, chamberlain and constable).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_FrCaptE] From the 12th century onwards, these positions were the preserve of the aristocracy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_FrCaptE][MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_FrCaptE] The clergy of the Church provided a pool of 'educated, literature and numerate subjects' and were a vital resource for the government and administration of the Capetian Kingdom.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_FrCaptE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Innovations in agriculture resulted in population increases during this period, especially in northern and western France, but demographic expansion would not begin in earnest until the later Capetian era.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_FrCaptE] From the 11th to the 14th century CE, the French population almost quadrupled from about 4 to 15 million.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_FrCaptE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Capetian Dynasty ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Capetian_1000CE: 987CE-1099CE; Capetian_1100CE: 1100CE-1150CE ♥</b>  Capetian_1000CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_FrCaptE] Capetian_1100CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_FrCaptE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  266362: 987CE-1099CE;  164716: 1100CE-1150CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Germanic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Old Frankish ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Christianity ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Catholicism ♥</b></div></body></html>
