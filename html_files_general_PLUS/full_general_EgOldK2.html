[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_EgOldK2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The decentralizing trend in this period is reflected in the development of a provincial nobility.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]According to Hassan (1993), "In the later years of the Old Kingdom, the provincial officials became hereditary holders of their posts and regarded their nomes as their own property."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_EgOldK2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Egypt - Classic Old Kingdom ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Egypt - Period of the Regions ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Memphis ♥</b>Original name was hw.t-k3-Ptah ("Estate/house of the spirit of Ptah") [MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_EgOldK2]founded at the beginning of the 1st Dynasty.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_EgOldK2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]This original site was "probably gradually replaced in importance by the more populated suburbs further to the south, approximately to the east of Teti's pyramid. Djed-isut, the name of this part of the city, derived from the name of Teti's pyramid and its pyramid town. The royal palaces of Djedkara and Pepy I (and possibly also that of Unas) may, however, have already been transferred further south ... to places in the valley east of the present South Saqqara and separated from Djed-isut by a lake."

Provincial administration in 19 Upper Egyptian nomes (Dynasties IV-VI, ca. 2600-2180 BC)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_EgOldK2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Old Kingdom period of Egypt covers the Third to Sixth ruling Dynasties, a period stretching from about 2650 to 2150 BCE. Seshat divides this period into two groups, the 'Classic' Old Kingdom period, covering the First through Fifth Dynasties (roughly 2650-2350 BCE), and the 'Late' Old Kingdom, comprising turbulent Sixth Dynasty (2350-2150 BCE). This dynasty witnessed a decentralization of the king's authority, leading to the First Intermediate Period, or Period of the Regions.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The kings of the Sixth Dynasty were still based at the capital in Memphis. Lower Nubia, over 1000 km away from the Egyptian centre, was organized into six small chiefdoms under the Sixth Dynasty.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_EgOldK2] The <i>hwt</i>, once a royal possession and conveyor of central authority, was now dominated by a powerful provincial nobility that viewed their area of control as hereditary property[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_EgOldK2] - a development enshrined in the governor's new title, 'great chief of the nome'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_EgOldK2] It appears that military institutions did not change significantly from the Early to the Late Old Kingdom: there was still no permanent, state-run standing army.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_EgOldK2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Long viewed as an incarnation of an ancient sky and falcon god called Horus, from the Fourth Dynasty onward the Egyptian king also was considered the son of a sun god, Ra.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_EgOldK2] Ra grew in importance during the Old Kingdom and, around the beginning of the Fifth Dynasty, had essentially become an Egyptian state god. During the Sixth Dynasty the sun temples in which Ra was worshipped became large institutions maintained by donations and landed property.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_EgOldK2] In contrast to the earlier age, during the Sixth Dynasty it was promotion within the sun temples that became the route to high office within the palatial bureaucracy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_EgOldK2] Priests would not become full-time professionals until the New Kingdom: at this time, they worked rotating shifts.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_EgOldK2] Nevertheless, large-scale temple building for a wide range of local gods, including Khenti-amentiu at Abydos; Min at Koptos; Hathor at Dendera; Horus at Hierankonpolis; and Satet at Elephantine, underlines the florescence of religious expression as well as the command of a large labour pool by the king and local elites more generally during the Sixth Dynasty.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_EgOldK2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The growing power of local elites, commanding religious and administrative authority as well as great agricultural wealth and control over labour in the form of corvée dues, undermined the central power of Sixth-Dynasty rulers. After the death of King Pepi II (r. 2278-2184 BCE), there were repeated contests over the succession.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_EgOldK2] Eventually, these conflicts, coupled with the declining authority of the kings and possibly periods of famine caused by successive harvest failures due to poor Nile flooding, led to the collapse of centralized authority and the onset of the First Intermediate Period, or Period of the Regions.</div></body></html>
