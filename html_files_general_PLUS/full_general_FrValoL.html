It had become fallow, full of thickets and woods by the continuous wars under three kings and more like the haunt of beasts than of men."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_FrValoL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ loose; unitary state ♥</b>Government was more centralized north of the Loire.

French language, favoured in court and central government, spread gradually into the regions. "The jurists of the chancellery and high courts had worked essentially in French from the fourteenth century and this opened the way for the triumph of French as the literary language."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_FrValoL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b>The Late Valois (Valois dynasty) represent the last century of Valois rule over the French Kingdom from 1450-1589 CE. The period was greatly impacted by the French Renaissance, external war against the Italians and Habsburgs, and the internal Wars of Religion. First Late Valois king Louis XI (1461-1483 CE) continued to modernize the royal government, and implemented the first royal postal service.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_FrValoL] The French Renaissance hit its cultural peak during the rule of Frances I (1515-1547 CE) and Henry II (1547-1559 CE). Artists and scholars traveled from Italy to France, and had an immense impact on architecture, culture, and art. Urban life was transformed by Renaissance culture and the printing press.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_FrValoL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Calais was returned to France from England, and Burgundy, Dauphiné, Provence, and the Three Bishoprics in Lorraine were secured in this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_FrValoL] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_FrValoL] The territory of the Kingdom of France was between 400,000 and 500,000 square meters during the rule of the Late Valois.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_FrValoL] Outside of Europe, explorer Jacques Cartier paved the way for future French colonies in Canada, and French explorers and merchants began to exploit the west African coast.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_FrValoL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Valois fought the Italian Wars from 1494-1559 CE over the French crown’s claim on the kingdom of Naples. In 1519 CE, Charles V of the Spanish Habsburgs became the Holy Roman Emperor. The wars in Italy were the start of a lasting rivalry between the Habsburgs and Valois. In 1559 CE, France gave up all claims in Italy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_FrValoL] The last Valois kings were weakened by the Wars of Religion (Huguenot Wars) (1562-1598 CE), between the Roman Catholics and Reformed Protestants. 3 million people died in the conflict or from famine or disease during the war.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_FrValoL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Early Valois king Charles VII's work to modernize the French government was continued by Louis XI. The royal council became less feudal and more bureaucratic, the king was advised by professional lawyers rather than feudal vassals, and the financial and judicial functions of government were separated.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_FrValoL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_FrValoL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The disasters of the late 14th and 15th century had decimated the population of many cities and towns in France.
