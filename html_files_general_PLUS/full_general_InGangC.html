Here, we are interested in the phase of its prehistory known as the Chalcolithic (c. 3000-6001 BCE). Overall, there is not much to suggest that the transition from the Neolithic to the Chalcolithic significantly changed the prevalent lifestyle, apart from the addition of copper technology and new forms of pottery. Larger sites found in the wider Gangetic region dating from this time have yielded evidence for agricultural activities, including animal husbandry; moreover, one site (Chirand) has also yielded evidence for large-scale production of tools made of bone and antler, as well as of items of likely domestic use, indicating some degree of craft specialisation. The political organisation of such sites remain overall unclear, though one site in a neighbouring valley, Magahara, seems to have housed a relatively egalitarian community, judging from the similarity between houses and their arrangement around a likely cattle pen, suggesting communal ownership of livestock. No population estimates could be found for the Middle Ganga specifically, but the typical community in the nearby Vindhya region would likely have numbered around 200 people, and the region as a whole likely had a population of about 1,000.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_InGangC]</div></body></html>
