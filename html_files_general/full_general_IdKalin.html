This country sent its first embassy to the T'ang court around the middle of the seventh century, while the last is mentioned under the year 818, about a century before the overthrow of the T'ang dynasty itself. For a long time scholars were satisfied that the name "Ho-ling" must have been a Chinese version of the Sanskrit "Kalingga" or of an Indonesian derivation of this name, "Kiling," and must have indicated a settlement of Indian immigrants from the Coromandel coast." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_IdKalin] "The first scholar to question this Kalingga thesis exhaustively was Damais. He showed that the transliteration of Ho-ling as Kalingga or even Kiling ran counter to the constant practice and known principles of Chinese transcription for over a thousand years.4 He suggested instead that "Walaing" or "Walbng," a toponym or title which appears in a number of Javanese inscriptions between 856 and 919, may have been the indigenous matrix of the name Ho-ling. Yet both the justification of the transliteration of Ho-ling, as Walaing, and Walaing's qualifications to be regarded as a kingdom are not entirely convincing, as Damais himself conceded. Yet he wants his thesis to be accepted "au moins provisoirement."

These principalities each senttheir own envoys, only rarely banding together. There are indeed hints of fierce fratricidal wars and the subjection of neighboring states ina letter of the king of Ho-lo-tan to the emperor and in the story about Gunavarman. But the first reference to a true overlordship dates from the eighth century and is provided by both the Revised T'ang Annals and the proclamation of the king Sanjaya. Yet the extent of this overlord- ship remains a matter for conjecture." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_IdKalin]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥</b> No political/military alliance. "Ho-ling, based in central Java, was one of two fifth-century Java coastal centres with which the Chinese court interacted (Ho-lo-tan in the Tarum River basin near modern Jakarta was the other). When in the seventh century the kings of Srivijaya created their polity, they subordinated and incorporated into their realm a number of previously independent river-mouth ports on the northern and western coasts of Java, but they made no effort to include the rest of the island. In particular, they made no effort to subordinate central Java and its Kedu Plain, a unique and valuable part of the maritime realm. The relationship that developed between Srivijaya and central Java was a mutually advantageous, symbiotic linkage between a state dependent on the control of international trade and a rice-plain that remained somewhat distant from that trade."

Probably cannot be used for polity territory estimates.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Kalingga, or Ho-ling, is a rather enigmatic polity that seems to be mostly known through contemporary Chinese documents. According to these annals, Kalingga was one of two Javanese coastal centres that interacted with the T'ang court in the fifth century CE, the other one being Ho-lo-tan, in the Tarum basin.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_IdKalin] A North Indian Buddhist monk named Gunavarman wrote about his visit to Kalingga in 422, and we know that the polity sent envoys to China in 430, 440, and in the 640s and 660s.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_IdKalin][MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_IdKalin] According to Chinese records, by the seventh century, Kalingga had expanded inland, and counted twenty-eight small polities as its allies.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_IdKalin][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Kalingga was likely a monarchy, [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_IdKalin] but overall the sources are silent on the exact details of its political organization.
