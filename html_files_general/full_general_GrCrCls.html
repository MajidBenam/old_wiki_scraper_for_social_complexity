[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_GrCrCls] Political, military and religious control in Cretan city-states was exercised by the Kosmoi (<i>Κόσμοι</i>), a board of 3 to 10 nobles, annually elected by the Ecclesia, the body of free male citizens. One of the Kosmoi, known as protokosmos or stratagetas, was the president of the board. The council of elders, the Gerousia, whose members were chosen among the best Kosmoi, had legislative and juridical authority.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_GrCrCls][MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_GrCrCls]</div></body></html>
