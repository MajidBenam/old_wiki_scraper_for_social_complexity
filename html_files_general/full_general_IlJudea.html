After his death in 104 BCE, his sons and grandsons engaged in frequent intrigues and civil wars involving much loss of life. While Alexander Jannaeus briefly conquered additional territory in the Transjordan, he soon lost it and much of Hyrcanus' earlier conquests following the disastrous Battle of Gadara in 93 BCE.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣141-63 BCE ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ confederated state ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ {vassalage; nominal allegiance}: 141-116 BCE; none: 115-63 BCE ♥</b> While Judea was technically a vassalage of the Seleucids in the earlier period, Jonathan and Simon assiduously played both sides of the Seleucid succession struggles against the middle, at times winning considerable practical autonomy. Circa 116 or 115 BCE, John Hyrcanus I broke away from the crippled Seleucid Empire and followed an independent policy, which lasted until his feuding descendants invited Pompey in.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Seleucid Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b> This coding is arguable. The code book doesn't have a good descriptor for "successful political rebellion"; the new elites who ejected the Seleucids, the Hasmonean dynasty, were native to Judea, so "elite migration" doesn't really fit either. "Cultural assimilation" might fit, perhaps. At any rate, in 153 BCE the Hasmonean leader Jonathan "Apphus," having led a years-long guerrilla war against the Seleucids after the death of his brother (Judah the Maccabbi), was confirmed as High Priest and ruler of the Jews as a vassal of the Seleucid claimant Alexander Balas. In the swirl of conflict over the Seleucid throne, Jonathan fell into a trap and was executed in 142 BCE; he was succeeded by his brother Simon, who achieved a measure of quasi-independence from the Seleucids—though he remained a vassal and the population retained strong elements of Hellenism. Simon was confirmed as High King and Prince in a popular assembly in 141 BCE.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Late Roman Republic ♥</b> Two brothers of the Hasmonean dynasty, King Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II, contended for the throne in continual civil wars and intrigues from 67-63 BCE. Finally each appealed to the Romans in Syria under Pompey the Great to intervene on his side.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_IlJudea] Pompey, seeing the opportunity, intervened on the side of the ineffectual Hyrcanus, besieged Jerusalem and took it in 63 BCE, and absorbed Judea into the Roman Empire as a protectorate.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ Jewish diaspora ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣ 100,000 ♥</b>km squared.

It had once been believed by scholars that Aramaic had replaced Hebrew altogether (outside of religious contexts), but newer archaeological evidence has shown that view to be mistaken.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_IlJudea] Greek, meanwhile, was introduced by the Macedonian Empire and reinforced during the rule of the Ptolemies and the Seleucids, and was additionally important as a trade language.</div><div class='meatypart'></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Semitic; Indo-European ♥</b>This map is representative of several maps that vary slightly; the precise borders cannot be determined from the records available. Note that Hasmonean control did not extend down into the Negev Desert.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Judea (originally Yehuda) polity of 141 - 63 BCE was formed when Simon Thassi, brother of the executed Jonathan Apphus who had waged war against the Seleucids, was elected as High King and Prince in a popular assembly in 141 BCE. Simon achieved a measure of quasi-independence from the Seleucids—though he remained a vassal and the population retained strong elements of Hellenism.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]According to archaeologists, it seems that Galilee was only sparsely settled before this period, and that the conquering of territories and increase in Jewish communities coming into the area contributed to the rise in permanent settlements and population during this time. However, agreements over the population differs widely, with estimates on the largest settlement, Jerusalem, ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 people.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_IlJudea][MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_IlJudea][MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_IlJudea][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Judea was a sophisticated, well-organised and equipped society, with markets, established trade routes, water transportation infrastructure, aqueducts and cisterns, temples and palaces, sporting arenas, libraries, and many other modern features.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_IlJudea] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_IlJudea] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_IlJudea]</div></body></html>
