At this time appears the first signs of warfare, an increase in social complexity and more widespread consumption of farmed crops like maize.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The increase in social complexity was reflected in settlements with houses clustered into court-yard groups.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_USMisSp] While there is little evidence for warfare in the preceding Middle Woodland[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_USMisSp] from c800 CE there is evidence of inter-group violence as human bones have been recovered with arrow points embedded into them in individual and group burials.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_USMisSp] Some settlements even gained palisades and ditches[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_USMisSp], although at this time they were present at only a tiny fraction of all sites (0.5% between 800-950 CE[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_USMisSp]). After 700-800 CE there was a dramatic intensification of food production, particularly of maize farming, which brought higher yields and enabled more food to be extracted from a smaller territory and would lead to population growth.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_USMisSp][MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_USMisSp][MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_USMisSp][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The evidence suggests communities experienced increased differentiation of social roles, with individuals dedicated to "community defense, organization of labor, and communal storage of maize in secure central places".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_USMisSp] The Upper Mississippi region was populated by a number of small communities. The population of largest settlement was probably in the region of 500 people - although this population was not resident at the site that later became Cahokia.</div></body></html>
