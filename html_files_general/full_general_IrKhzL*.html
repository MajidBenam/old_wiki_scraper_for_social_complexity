This trend towards centralization may also be suggested by the presence of possible elite or "Khan's" houses during this time at several sites (Hole 1987a: 41). In spite of these trends, Chalcolithic society throughout Khuzistan presents a strong egalitarian appearance. During the Middle and Late Chalcolithic, differential access to resources may have involved less archaeological1y visible items such as staples. access to water, and control over labor, as it appears to have done at this time in Mesopotamia (Stein 1994)."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_IrKhzL*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The beginning of this period saw an increase in agricultural processes which were made possible by the cattle-drawn plough and irrigation.
