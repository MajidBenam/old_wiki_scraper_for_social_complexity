        “Following the collapse of the Yüan dynasty in 1368, its last emperor, the Mongol ejen qaghan (emperor, hereafter spelled kaghan) Toghon Temür, retired from Beijing and returned to Mongolia with his army. Karakorum once again became the capital of a Mongol state, one which now ruled essentially within its own ethnic boundaries. <br> This country, which extended from Manchuria to Kyrgyzstan between the Great Wall of China and Lake Baikal, was a relatively large entity, and its ambitions to regain sovereignty over China still caused considerable anxiety to the Ming dynasty, which had supplanted the Yüan in China.&nbsp;» <sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> Karakorum was then destroyed by the Ming in 1380. <sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>

<p>After the Yuan dynasty collapsed in 1368, Toghon Temur, its last emperor retired with his army to Mongolia, where he established a new state, with Karakorum as its capital, that extended from Manchuria to Kyrgyzstan between the Great Wall of China and Lake Baikal.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> The new Mongolian polity was actually a loose alliance of six tribal confederations or tümens united under a common Khan, and the Khalkhas were one of these confederations. The Khalkhas were themselves divided into the Northern and Southern Khalkhas, and the Northern Khalkhas were divided into left-flank and right-flank Khalkhas For much of their history, the Khalkhas fought against the neighbouring Oirat confederation, with only a few decades' truce in the first half of the seventeenth century. In 1662, conflict flared up between the left-flank and right-flank Khalkhas, but it was the Oirats' invasion under Zungharian leadership that led to the fall of the Khalkha confederacy, as it pushed the Khalkhas to request Beijing's protection, which the Chinese emperor granted in 1691, in exchange for political submission.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Population and political organization</i>
</p>
<p>Like other Mongol confederacies, the Khalkhas were organised in a confederacy ruled by its own ruler, who however deferred to the overarching khan. <sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the 1630s, the Khalkhas, along with the Chahars, comprised 19,580 families;<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> estimating 3-8 people per family results in a figure of between 58,740 and 156,640 people, which, halved to exclude the Chahars, falls to between 30,000 and 80,000.</p>
