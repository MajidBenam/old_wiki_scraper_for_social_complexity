It mostly corresponds to the Copper Age (Età del Rame) plus the Early Bronze Age (Prima Età del Bronzo). In Latium, the region of Central Italy that roughly matches modern-day Lazio, the main Copper Age sites include Ponte S. Pietro, Porcareccia and Rinaldone (near the modern-day city of Viterbo), Sgurgola and Casamari (near Frosinone), Castel Malnome and Ardea (near Rome), and Cantalupo Mandela (near Sabina).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_ItLatCA] The period is characterized by low density occupation and scattered material finds, mainly grave sites; nothing in the region comparable to the complex contemporary social formations present in Egypt, China, and the Near East.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]None of the above-mentioned sites is considered a 'nucleated settlement', but they have all yielded useful finds: the Viterbo locations and Sgurgola are small necropolises, while miscellaneous grave goods have been unearthed at the other sites.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_ItLatCA] Overall, it seems likely that Latium Copper Age communities were quite small — one estimate posits 100-200 inhabitants each[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_ItLatCA] — and some estimates for the Early Bronze Age even go so far as to say that each settlement probably only had a few dozen inhabitants.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_ItLatCA] The burial data appear to reflect a patriarchal, war-oriented culture: men and women are associated with very different types of grave goods, and male burials are always accompanied by weapons.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_ItLatCA][MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_ItLatCA]</div></body></html>
