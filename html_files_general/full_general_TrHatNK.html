It was found to be located near modern Boğazkale, Turkey, within the great loop of the Kızılırmak River. Hattusa exerted dominating influence upon the civilizations of the 2nd and 1st millennia BC in Anatolia and Northern Syria. The palaces, temples, trading quarters and necropolis of this political and religious metropolis provide a comprehensive picture of a capital and bear a unique testimony to the disappeared Hittite civilization. The city's fortifications, along with the Lion Gate, the Royal Gate and the Yazılıkaya rupestral ensemble with its sculptured friezes, represent unique artistic achievements as monuments.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Hattusa was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1986[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_TrHatNK].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Nesite; Luwian ♥</b> And many others.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_TrHatNK] "We find that no fewer than eight languages are represented in the tablet archives of the capital. Probably as many if not more languages were spoken in the streets of the capital every day, some of them quite different from the languages of the archives." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_TrHatNK] "The official language of the kingdom was an Indo-European language called Nesite, which we commonly refer to today as the 'Hittite' language." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_TrHatNK] Luwian was not the official language but it "very likely became the most widely spoken language of the Late Bronze Age Hittite empire."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_TrHatNK] "The Cuneiform script was used throughout its history to write a number of different languages, and the Hattusa archives are composed for the most part in their writers' own language, generally termed by us 'Hittite', but by them 'Nesite', i.e. the language of Nesa or Kanes (modern Kultepe), which had presumably been an earlier Hittite centre, before Hattusa in Hatti. ... The Hittites also used the language Akkadian ('Babylonian' to them) as the international language of communication."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_TrHatNK] Other languages "found in the archives, mostly of ritual and mythological content. These include Hattian, the pre-Hittite language of Hatti, and Hurrian, the language of the Hittites eastern neighbours; also Luwian and Palaic, languages closely related to Hittite, spoken by their kinsmen dwelling respectively to the south and south-west, and to the north-west of Hatti, and constituting with Hittite the IInd millennium B.C. section of the Anatolian group of Indo-European."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_TrHatNK]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_TrHatNK]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Genus ♣ Hittite Religions ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Genus ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion ♣ ♥</b>The period of the Hittite New Kingdom lasts from about 1400-1180 BCE although the dynasty that created it, originating from the city Kumbnani within the Kizzuwatna polity, came to power in the mid-fifteenth century BCE. The rulers of this dynasty were the creators of the Hittite empire, which during the reign of King Suppiluliuma I (1356-1319 BCE) and his successors achieved the greatest prosperity. In the period of its greatest splendor, the Hittite king controlled up to 400,000 squared kilometers of land including the areas of Northern Mesopotamia, Syria and Palestine.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The central bureaucracy was relatively sophisticated: a Chief of the Scribes headed up the Hittite chancellery[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_TrHatNK] whilst a separate administrator, the hazannu, had responsibility for the city of Hattusa.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_TrHatNK] Keepers of the Royal Storehouses were also important officials.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_TrHatNK] District governors known as Lord of the Watchtower were appointed for the provinces[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_TrHatNK] whilst the conquest of Syria c1340 BCE lead to the position of viceroy being created for the important urban centre of Karkamis.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_TrHatNK] The power of the state was based on the army, which was great for the times - it had iron weapons, armor, and excellent war chariots.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]During the reign of Muwattalli, Ramses II was in power in Egypt, and the war between two most powerful states in the Middle East area resulted in the first written international treaty known to us as " Kadesh Treaty ". Although this treaty was originally written in the Akkadian language, copies in Hittite and Egyptian languages were made.  Around 1200 BCE, the Hittite state probably fell under the pressure of the Sea Peoples, although a few Hittite city-states in Northern Syria survived until 708 BC.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Hittite Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Hittite_1400BCE: 1400BCE-1301BCE; Hittite_1300BCE: 1300BCE-1201BCE; Hittite_1200BCE: 1200BCE-1180BCE ♥</b>  Hittite_1200BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_TrHatNK] Hittite_1300BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_TrHatNK] Hittite_1400BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_TrHatNK]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  50221: 1400BCE-1301BCE;  431782: 1300BCE-1201BCE;  455050: 1200BCE-1180BCE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Anatolian ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Hittite ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Ancient Anatolian Religion ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Hittite Religion ♥</b></div></body></html>
