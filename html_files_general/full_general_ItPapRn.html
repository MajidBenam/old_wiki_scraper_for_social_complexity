Julius' pontificate furthermore was a highpoint of the Roman Renaissance, as he sponsored artists such as Rafael and Michelangelo; in addition to this, Rome in the first quarter of the sixteenth century was a major diplomatic and political hub.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_ItPapRn] This peak date should be bracketed, however, given that Julius was widely reviled during his own time (Erasmus wrote a famous dialogue between him and St. Peter, castigating Julius' worldliness) and by posterity as an excessively worldly pope. In addition, the almost completely secular orientation of the late fifteenth and early sixteenth-century popes was directly responsible for the Protestant Reformation, which would mark one of the greatest challenges to papal power the Church had ever faced.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 1378-1527 CE ♥</b>The polity period begins with the return of the papacy to Rome, and ends with the Sack of Rome. Pope Urban V (r. 1362-70) attempted to return to Rome, but was driven out by the Romans and returned to Avignon in 1370.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_ItPapRn] The efforts of the papacy to return to Rome and the Patrimony were frequently stymied, and Urban VI's eventual success (1377-78) in returning to Rome provoked the Great Schism.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_ItPapRn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Alternate start: 1417. "popes in the century between ca. 1430 and 1530 concentrated their efforts on protecting their Italian domain and in lavishly reconstructing the city of Rome.

In general, the various lords, cities, and feudatories of the papal states were ready and willing to rebel when possible (for example, in 1375.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_ItPapRn]) Furthermore, the lords of the Romagna were <i>de facto</i> independent for much of the late 14th and early 15th centuries.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_ItPapRn] During the mid-15th century, King Ferrante of Naples deliberately contracted with Roman barons for them to raise mercenary bands for his service, undercutting these barons' feudal ties to the papacy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_ItPapRn]Brackets are required to reflect the consolidation of papal authority in the papal states during the fifteenth century, and the ambiguous relationship between papally-appointed, clerical officials and the local elites they were theoretically superior to.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_ItPapRn] Peterson has characterized the Church by this period as bureaucratic and legalistic, especially in the administration of the papal state.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_ItPapRn]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥</b> The period up to 1494 was marked by a lack of foreign interference in Italian affairs.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_ItPapRn] As distinct from the 13th and most of the 14th centuries, the papacy was often free from domination by German emperors or Spanish kings, following the return to Rome.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_ItPapRn] Brackets should be added to indicate the drastically changed situation between 1494-1527, following the French king Charles VIII's invasion of Italy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_ItPapRn]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Rome - Republic Restoration Period ♥</b>  <i>Cola di Rienzo's Revolution in Rome. </i>Nicholaus, severus et clemens, libertatis, pacis justiciaeque tribunus, et sacra Romana Reipublica liberator.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Papal States - Medieval Period I ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ Christendom ♥</b> However, during the period 1300-1450 CE "the idea of Christendom as a supranational entity toward which all Christians felt supreme loyalty and affection slowly collapsed. With the evolution of independent political and physical territories, soon to be called national monarchies or states, Christians began to choose between allegiance to state and devotion to church, and many chose the former. By the fifteenth century, the papacy ceased to function as a universal power and more and more like another regional Italian prince jealously guarding his fiefdom."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_ItPapRn]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Rome ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Latin ♥</b> Latin remained the language of administration, culture, and intellectual life during this period.

Goldthwaite has argued that the papacy's return to Rome in 1378 inaugurated a phase of economic growth for the Rome and its hinterland, reflecting Rome's dependence on the papacy, and not Lazio's productivity, to stimulate the economy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_ItPapRn] Before the sack of Rome in 1527 CE[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_ItPapRn] the population had finally begun to grow again, from about 30,000 early in the 14th century to 55,000.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Renaissance Popes attempted to systematize and unify the financial administration of the Papal State. This meant ending financial and judicial immunities, and rolling back the power of locally powerful bishops and abbots.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_ItPapRn] However, the vast bureaucracy the Pope oversaw was a fundamentally corrupt one, by the late 14th century founded on bribery, the sale of offices, and patronage politics.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_ItPapRn] During the fifteenth century, the sale of offices within the <i>curia</i> became routinized; and Peterson has estimated that under Pope Leo X (1513-1521), two thousand offices were for sale in the city of Rome alone.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_ItPapRn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The papacy's ability to control the regions of the Papal States fluctuated dramatically during this period, especially during the Great Schism (1378-1417 CE). During the Schism, numerous ecclesiastical territories in the Papal State were seized by or alienated to secular lords.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_ItPapRn] The 1380s and 1390s were characterized by a long and futile struggle between the Roman and Avignon popes for control of territory and finances in central and southern Italy, with the long-term result being the destabilization of central Italy and the intensified decentralization of power in the Papal State, especially in the Romagna and <i>le Marche</i>.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_ItPapRn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In general, the various lords, cities, and feudatories of the papal states were ready and willing to rebel when possible, for example, in 1375 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_ItPapRn] Furthermore, the lords of the petty Lords known as the Romagna were <i>de facto</i> independent for much of the late 14th and early 15th centuries.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_ItPapRn] During the mid-15th century, King Ferrante of Naples deliberately contracted with Roman barons for them to raise mercenary bands for his service, undercutting these barons' feudal ties to the papacy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_ItPapRn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]As distinct from the previous centuries, up until 1494 CE the Papal States was usually free from influence of German emperors or Spanish kings,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_ItPapRn] but the drastically changed situation between 1494-1527 CE, following the French king Charles VIII's invasion of Italy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_ItPapRn]</div></body></html>
