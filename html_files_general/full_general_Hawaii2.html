The starting date is approximately when the population began to increase parabolically, and the ending date is when the population had plateaued[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_Hawaii2]. AD: changed from end date of 1650 CE following an email from Patrick Kirch: "I would be inclined to put the division between Hawaii2 and Hawaii3 at around 1580 with the reign of 'Umi-a-Liloa who supposedly consolidated the entire island into one polity. Certainly, intensification of the great dryland field systems was also underway by this time. So, 1650 seems a bit late for these key transitions."

Our 'Hawaii 2' refers to the period from 1200 to 1580 CE. 1200 marks the beginning of archaeologist Patrick Kirch's 'expansion period',[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_Hawaii2] while 1580 is the approximate date of the formation of the first island-wide unitary kingdom.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_Hawaii2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]According to reconstructions of Hawaiki, the ancestral Polynesian homeland, ancient Polynesians recognized the authority of the <i>*ariki</i>, that is, the head of a lineage, who had both secular and sacred authority and was in charge of most, if not all, rituals.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_Hawaii2] However, a few thousand years separate Ancestral Polynesians from the earliest Hawaiians, and it is not clear how much the latter retained of the former's culture and sociopolitical organization. The earliest island-wide unitary kingdom on the Big Island emerged around 1580;[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_Hawaii2] before then, the Big Island was probably divided into several small, independent polities.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_Hawaii2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]It is currently not possible to reconstruct the exact population of a typical Big Island community at this time.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_Hawaii2] No up-to-date estimates have been found in the literature. Scholars do, however, distinguish between distinct phases of demographic and agricultural development after the initial colonization period. From 1200 to 1400 CE, Hawaiians experienced significant population growth and adapted their technology and subsistence economy to local conditions while maintaining long-distance contact with Eastern Polynesia. From 1400 to 1580 CE, population growth peaked and began to stabilize, contact with Eastern Polynesia ceased, and large-scale dryland field systems were established across the Big Island.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_Hawaii2]</div></body></html>
