It also was the furthest extent of (nominal) papal power until Pope Innocent III (r. 1198-1216) began consolidating what would become the Papal States.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_ItPapEM] The period from 1036 to 1066 was characterized, however, by internal warfare and Salian invasions (despite the short-lived expansionist respite of 1049-1054 ending after Civitella). Thus, it could be argued that the real peak of the polity was under the Tusculan Reform Papacy c.1012-1036 CE because of internal and external stability, and socioeconomic and (even if limited) demographic expansion.

During his pontificate, the papacy began consolidating its control over Lazio and expanding its power through what would become the Papal States; simultaneously, Innocent III brought papal authority to its medieval height, initiating several crusades and presiding over the Fourth Lateran Council.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_ItPapEM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ loose ♥</b>  In general, this period was marked by a high degree of fragmentation and sub-regional autonomy, with various areas of the Patrimony of St. Peter virtually independent of the Papacy or subject to central powers in a very nominal way.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_ItPapEM] Papal sovereignty over central Lazio was rarely in question,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_ItPapEM] yet the papacy's ability to control subject cities and defend its territory from outside threats was often minimal, particularly in regard to territory on the fringes of papal control.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_ItPapEM] For example, the city of Gaeta, in the extreme south of Lazio, was <i>de facto</i> independent of the papacy by the early 10th century.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_ItPapEM] In the late eleventh and twelfth centuries, the papacy was frequently at war with the German emperors, causing serious destabilization of political authority in the Patrimony. I should emphasize, however, that it is difficult to pin down which of these terms is most accurate, since the papacy frequently entered alliances during this period, and significant parts of the Patrimony were <i>de facto</i> annexed by the Empire for decades at a time.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_ItPapEM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ vassalage ♥</b> Papal relations with other polities fluctuated dramatically during this period; I coded it as "vassalage" to reflect the fact that the papacy during this period was often dominated by the German emperors.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Rome - Republic of St Peter I ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Papal State I ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ Latin Christendom ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣ 17,000,000  ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Rome ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Latin ♥</b> Latin remained the sole language of administration, diplomacy, liturgy, and culture throughout the period.

The population of Rome languished at a relative historical low of 35,000 people throughout this period, which was marked by a high degree of fragmentation and sub-regional autonomy. Various areas of the Patrimony of St. Peter were virtually independent of the Papacy or subject to central authority only in a very nominal way.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_ItPapEM][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Through the 904-1198 CE period the polity, with its capital at Rome, was dominated by powerful families and a powerful foreign state.
