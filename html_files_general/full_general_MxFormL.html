The start date 650 BC for the MxFormL quasi-polity is the beginning of the Late Formative period (c.650-200 BC) in the Basin of Mexico (alternatively called "First Intermediate Period 2").[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_MxFormL] The end date is fuzzy and problematic because it is unclear exactly when in the Terminal Formative period (c.200-1 BC; alternatively called "First Intermediate Period 3") the entire MxFormL quasi-polity was conquered by its aggressive neighbors Cuicuilco (<a href="/w/index.php?title=Basin_of_Mexico-Cui&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Basin of Mexico-Cui (page does not exist)">Basin of Mexico-Cui</a>) and Teotihuacan (<a href="/w/index.php?title=Basin_of_Mexico-Teo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Basin of Mexico-Teo (page does not exist)">Basin of Mexico-Teo</a>). Since the MxFormL quasi-polity is made up of multiple, discrete, independent settlement clusters, the timing of their conquest by Cuicuilco and Teotihuacan was most likely different for different areas.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_MxFormL] This quasi-polity ceased to exist during the subsequent Tzacualli ceramic phase (c.1 BCE - 100 CE) because the Plinian eruption of Popocatepetl led to the abandonment of most of the quasi-polity', while the rest of the quasi-polity was taken over by Teotihuacan and Cuicuilco.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_MxFormL] The date ranges for the eruption/abandonment are c. 100 BCE - 50 CE, and the start date for the Tzacualli ceramic transition is centered around 1 BCE, so I use the date of 1 BCE to designate both events.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ quasi-polity ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> The settlement clusters of the MxFormL quasi-polity are thought to have been relatively independent and autonomous chiefdom-level polities during the Late Formative, but then gradually came under the control of neighboring Cuicuilco and Teotihuacan during the Terminal Formative c.200-1 BCE. While some have hypothesized that Cuicuilco headed some kind of Supra-polity political system during the Late Formative,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_MxFormL] the characteristics of such a Supra-polity political system are unknown to archaeologists.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ MxFormM ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b> Continuity in material culture, symbolic culture, settlement occupation, and subsistence practices</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ MxFormT ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣  ♥</b> Central Highland Mesoamerican Late-Terminal Formative.

The (Proto-)Oto-Manguean language family spread northward into the NGA with the first farming populations, and there is cultural continuity throughout the Formative.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_MxFormL] Nevertheless, there were also considerable Olmec stylistic influences in the Basin of Mexico and Morelos (Chalcatzingo) during the Early-Middle Formative, which may indicate intrusive Mixe-Zoquean speakers.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_MxFormL] Due to the massive population movement from the Formative to the time of the Spanish Contact -- including the widespread displacement of local ethnic groups by Nahuatl-speaking Uto-Aztecans -- and the lack of a deciphered writing system in the Basin of Mexico NGA prior to Nahuatl, the language(s) of the MxFormL remain unknown.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_MxFormL] The material/symbolic culture of the MxFormL quasi-polity has strong links with the occupants of the Puebla-Tlaxcala Valley to the east, and later Teotihuacan (the so-called "Olmeca-Xicallanca" ethnie), and it has been suggested that these peoples spoke variants of Mixe-Zoquean and/or Totonac languages from the Gulf Coast (based on loan words in local Nahuat dialects).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_MxFormL] On the other hand, the local red-on-buff pottery tradition is shared across west-central Mexico, and there are clear stylistic and material culture ties between Cuicuilco and the Chupicuaro basin of southeast Guanajuato,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_MxFormL] which would suggest Oto-Pamean or proto-Purépecha/Tarrascan languages.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_MxFormL] Given the great miscegenation of cultural influences in the area, it is likely that multiple languages were spoken, likely leading to unique new cultures, languages, and ethnicities.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language Genus ♣ ♥</b><b>Religion</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious Tradition ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Sect ♣ ♥</b><b>Maps</b></div><div class="thumb tleft"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:182px;"><a href="/w/index.php?title=Special:Upload&amp;wpDestFile=Basin_of_Mexico_First_Intermediate_2color.png" class="new" title="File:Basin of Mexico First Intermediate 2color.png">File:Basin of Mexico First Intermediate 2color.png</a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><b>Late Formative Occupation c.650-200 BCE:</b> Total area of quasi-polity in Red; Individual Settlement Clusters in Blue; Cuicuilco polity in Green.

Here, we are interested in the phase of its prehistory known as the Late Formative period (c. 400-101 BCE). In this period, polities throughout Mesoamerica experienced increases in wealth, influence, and hierarchical complexity.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_MxFormL] In the Basin of Mexico, Cuicuilco, Tlapacoya, and Cholula all became major regional centers with monumental architecture.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]No estimates could be found for the population of the average autonomous political unit at the time. The largest known settlement, Cuicuilco, may have had a population of at least 20,000 acrross 400 ha.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Political power was inherently theocratic;[MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_42_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_43_MxFormL] beyond that, the exact administrative mechanisms prevalent at the time remain unclear.</div></body></html>
