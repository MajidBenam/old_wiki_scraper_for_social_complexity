They create a complex and still not fully understood sociopolitical setting. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_GrCrOPa] The largest of these centers is Malia, ca. 60 hectares, followed by Knossos, ca. 45 hectares, and Phaistos 15 hectares. None of these centers, however, could be considered as a sort of the island's capital.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]♠ Language ♣ suspected unknown♥Information of the spoken and written language of Bronze Age Cretans during the Protopalatial period is scant due to the limited number of written documents. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_GrCrOPa] The few preserved documents were written in Cretan Hieroglyphic and Linear A script (Linear A was introduced at the end of the Protopalatial period at Knossos and Phaistos) are still undeciphered. What language was recorded in these documents is unknown.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]♠ Linguistic family ♣ ♥[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Crete is a large island in the Eastern Mediterranean. Here we consider the phase of its history best known as the Old Palace or Protopalatial Era. This period began around 1900[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_GrCrOPa], and ended around 1700, with a series of conflagration across the entire island, possibly caused by earthquake, possibly by inter-island wars[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_GrCrOPa][MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_GrCrOPa].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and Political Organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Old Palace period is marked by the appearance of regional states, and, in each of these, political, religious, ideological and/or economic authorities governed from “palaces”, that is, monumental court-centered building compounds such as the ones at Knossos, Malia, Phaistos and Petras[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_GrCrOPa]. However, evidence for administration is limited and consists mostly of clay archival documents.  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_GrCrOPa].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]According to Renfrew, each regional state had a population of 215,000[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_GrCrOPa].</div></body></html>
