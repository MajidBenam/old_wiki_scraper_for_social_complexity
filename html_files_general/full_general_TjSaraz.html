The period runs from its initial settlement around 3500 BCE to the site's abandonment c. 2000 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_TjSaraz] This period at Sarazm represents the first urban phase in Sogdiana and has yielded evidence of ceramic production, agriculture, irrigation and metallurgy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_TjSaraz] Ceramic evidence, along with the presence of seashells, suggests that contacts were maintained with different areas of Central Asia.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_TjSaraz][MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_TjSaraz][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Due to the nature of the remaining evidence, the political organization of Sarazm is not known. While 100 hectares have been excavated at the site, the settlement area expanded and contracted throughout its existence, making a definite population estimate difficult for this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_TjSaraz]</div></body></html>
