However, there is commonly accepted that Ubaid culture appeared much early in the southern Mesopotamia (around 6500 or 6300 BCE) and later spread toward northern regions. The earliest evidences of presence Ubaid culture in the northern Mesopotamia are dated to 5300 or 5200 BCE. The researchers distinguished 5 different phases of Ubaid period: Ubaid 0 (called also Oueili period; c. 6200-5550 BCE), Ubaid 1 (c. 5550- 5250 BCE), Ubaid 2 (c. 5250-5050 BCE), Ubaid 3 (5050- 4550 BCE), Ubaid 4 (4550- 4050 BCE, Late Ubaid) and Ubaid 5 (Terminal Ubaid, 4050-3800 BCE).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_IqUbaid], [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_IqUbaid], [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_IqUbaid], [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_IqUbaid]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Samarra and Halaf culture ♥</b> The Halaf and/ or Samarra tradition had significant contribution in foundation new Ubaid identity and culture, especially in northern and central Mesopotamia.

There are some conceptions which suggest that the important impact of forming the Ubaid in Mesopotamia had processes of acculturation and peaceful migration of small Ubaid group from north to south Mesopotamia. However, the researchers based mainly on ceramic and architectural evidences trying to reconstruct the origin of the Ubaid. Recently, new type of records have been included - aDNA analysis from site - Tell Kurdu (SE Anatolia) which showed that there is a clear genetic connections of these two Ubaid and Halaf populations (the examined individuals from both communities came from the same matriline).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_IqUbaid], [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_IqUbaid]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Uruk culture ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b> km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ suspected unknown  ♥</b>The name of 'Ubaid polity' derives from the archaeological site - Tell al-Ubaid located about six km west of Ur along the Euphrates River in Southern Iraq. This socio-cultural entity is characterized by homogeneous material culture, mainly pottery ('black-on-buff pottery'). However the Ubaid is defined and perceived in various ways, e.gas archaeological culture, chronological period,  cultural phenomenon, pottery style, 'oikumene' or interaction sphere. Among other elements of material culture typical for the Ubaid, the researchers mention usually the usage of flanged disc ('labrets'), clay nails and bent clay mullers, 'ophidian' figurines, stone mace-heads, tripartite architecture, niches-and-butressed public building as well as communal cemeteries with standardized grave goods. This period is often perceived as a first stage of development through complex urban society and the processes such as gradually urbanization of the settlement, social stratification as well as appearance of simple specialized manufacturing (especially agricultural, pottery making, weaving and wool production).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_IqUbaid]. Nowadays most of the researchers accepted the hypothesis regarding existence of elite class from at least the Late Ubaid period. It is embedded on five main arguments: usage of seals (called sometimes 'administrative tools'), erection of public buildings such as temples, two-tiered settlement pattern, mass production of some type of vessels (e. g. crude bowls), and production of high class of painted pottery used as a luxury goods. They believed that the system of increasing power of some group was intentionally masked by elite, therefore the presence of prestige objects or luxury goods is rather infrequent. There is presumed that the Ubaid depended rather on staple finance instead of wealth finance. Hence, there are very little traces of use of prestige goods or luxury items.

Akkermans, Forest, Hole.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_IqUbaid],[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_IqUbaid], [MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_IqUbaid]</div></body></html>
