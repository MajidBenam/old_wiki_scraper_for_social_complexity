A most decisive discontinuity occurred when, in the 1870s BC, Sesostris (Senustret) III embarked on his Nubian campaign."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_EgMidKg][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"In 1860 BC, ‘a complete reorganization of provincial administration was undertaken by King Sesostris [Senusret] III.  As a result, the old system of hereditary nomarchs was destroyed and replaced by a bureaucratic machinery, the operators of which owed their allegiance to the king in his residence’ (James, 1985: 51)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_EgMidKg]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ unitary state ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Egypt - Period of the Regions ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Egypt - Thebes-Hyksos Period ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Thebes; Itjtawyamenemhat ♥</b>11th Dynasty ruled from Thebes; 12th Dynasty ruled from el-Lisht.

We lack detailed information about the royal palace, although Stephen Quirke suggests that the terms <i>k3p</i> and <i>hnty</i> might refer to an inner and outer palace respectively.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_EgMidKg] The first Middle Kingdom capital was at Thebes in Upper Egypt, but was moved during the Twelfth Dynasty to El-Lisht at the neck of the Delta in Lower Egypt. From this new location, the monarchy exerted more centralized control over the country and expanded the bureaucratic system.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_EgMidKg] Administrative reforms under Senusret III (r. 1878-1839 BCE) resulted in the reorganization of the provinces around 1860 BCE: 'the old system of hereditary nomarchs was destroyed and replaced by a bureaucratic machinery, the operators of which owed their allegiance to the king'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_EgMidKg][MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_EgMidKg] For the first time since the Classic Old Kingdom, the central state had become powerful enough to directly command all the regions of Egypt.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]During the Middle Kingdom, the nome (province) of the Old Kingdom was replaced by a 'city district' centred on an urban complex and headed by a <i>hat-ya</i> ('mayor').[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_EgMidKg] The mayors received orders from the central government, specifically the vizier, and were responsible for tax collection and supervising the royal domains.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_EgMidKg] Thebes was the administrative centre for southern Upper Egypt and Lower Nubia.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_EgMidKg] The army was professional in the Middle Kingdom.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_EgMidKg] The king remained a divine ruler, legitimated as the guarantor and preserver of <i>maat</i>, the principle of harmony and cosmic order.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_EgMidKg][MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_EgMidKg][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Amenemhat III laid the foundations for a much larger Egyptian population (in his time, the country still had under two million inhabitants).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_EgMidKg] Using giant waterwheels and a canal from the Faiyum to the Nile, the Egyptians managed to improve irrigation in this fertile region and control flooding: a measure of sophisticated technology, strong central control, and a good deal of foresight. Another indication of the sophistication of Middle Kingdom technology is that the scribe responsible for the famed Rhind Mathematical Papyrus, dating to the Second Intermediate Period, noted that the work was copied from a Middle Kingdom original.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_EgMidKg] Literacy and a culture of storytelling were widespread: the Tale of the Eloquent Peasant, Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor, Story of Sinuhe, Account of the Sporting King, and many others represent the birth of written fiction in Egypt.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_EgMidKg] The Tale of King Cheops' Court reveals a lively interest at this time in the history of Classic Old Kingdom Egypt.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_EgMidKg]</div></body></html>
