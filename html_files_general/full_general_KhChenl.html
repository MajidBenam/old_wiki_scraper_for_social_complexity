'The first inscription in the Khmer language, heavily influenced by Sanskrit vocabulary, is dated AD 612 and comes from Angkor Borei; in the following century there were many more. But the details of political geography in each generation are obscure. For some of what we know, we are again indebted to Chinese sources, which speak of a Khmer state called 'Chen-la' (Zhenla). it is not clear what this name represents, but it is clearly an attempt to represent a foreign name with Chinese symbols.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_KhChenl] 'Akin to the MONS of Burma, the KHMERS established CHENLA, which enla- compassed modern Cambodia and northeast Thailand.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_KhChenl] 'The term Chenla, a Chinese name, was used from the seventh century C.E. to refesetr to the territory of modern Cambodia and northeast Thailand. Modern historians have also applied the term to the period of Cambodian history from the seventh to early ninth centuries C.E. The origin of the name is unknown. According to Sui shu (History of the Sui Dynasty, 581-618 C.E.), Chenla was a former vassal of the kingdom of Funan, and it gradually grew in power until King She-to-ssu-na of Chenla was able to assert his independence and conquer Fu- nan.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_KhChenl] 'Chinese records spoke of Land CHENLA and Water CHENLA, the former accessible overland and the latter reached by sea.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_KhChenl] 'At the beginning of the eighth century, in 711 and 717 C.E., two embassies from Chenla were received at the court of the Tang dynasty, together with embassies from a kingdom named Wentan. The Chiu T’ang shu (Old History of the Tang Dynasty) stated that from 706 C.E., Chenla was divided into two parts: Water Chenla and Land Chenla. Land Chenla was also called Wentan, and this kingdom sent three further embassies in 753 or 754, 771, and 799 C.E. An itinerary has survived from the end of the eighth century, describing an overland voyage to Wentan across the mountains from the re- gion of modern Hà T|nh in north-central Vietnam.The precise route of this journey is uncertain, but one of the destinations may have been the ancient city and temple site at Vat Phu in southern Laos. It is probable that the story of the division of Land and Water Chenla originated from the realization by the Tang court that the territory of Chenla comprised at least two major kingdoms—one that could be reached by sea, the other reached overland.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_KhChenl] 'Chenla is a name derived from Chinese historical records often used to describe an essentially protohistoric period dated between AD 550 and 800 that followed seamlessly from late prehistory.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_KhChenl]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternative names ♣ Zhen-la; Zhenla; Lin-yi; Chenla Principalities ♥</b> 'Changing patterns of Chinese maritime trade then skirted Funan, however, and political power moved inland to new and thrusting principalities known collectively as Chenla, again according to Chinese accounts.

Funan, the coastal polity dependent on maritime trade, apparently collapsed and was replaced in Cambodia by an entity known to the Chinese as 'Chenla', a state, or group of states, or pon-led communities based on the control of land and people, and extracting wealth from agriculture, and possibly inter-community trade, with little involvement in maritime activities.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_KhChenl] 'The term Chenla, a Chinese name, was used from the seventh century C.E. to refer to the territory of modern Cambodia and northeast Thailand. Modern historians have also applied the term to the period of Cambodian history from the seventh to early ninth centuries C.E.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_KhChenl] 'The first extends approximately from the first to the third centuries AD and provides firm evidence of trade within the region and also with India and beyond, since a gold medallion depicting the Roman emperor Antonius Pius and dated 152 AD was among the items unearthed. At this level there was no sign of Hinduism or Buddhism. [...] The second phase, from the fourth to the seventh centuries, is still categorised as "Funan" and bears witness to the adoption of the Indian religions, while the third, which can the called the Zhenla period, begins in the seventh century.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_KhChenl] 'The division of CHENLA weakened the KHMERS, and their power dissipated in the ninth century when rivals from island Southeast Asia began to encroach on the East- West trade.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_KhChenl] 'As the Chinese perceived the situation, Funan in the seventh century was conquered by Zhenla, located in the hinterland. The History of the Sui says Zhenla was originally Funan’s vassal, located southwest of Linyi.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_KhChenl] 'The Chenla states that rose and fell between 550 and 800 were essentially agrarian, and their economy revolved around the temple.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_KhChenl] 'During the eighth century, the number of inscrip- tions fell markedly, and the historic record became thin. This does not necessarily imply cultural decline. On the contrary, it was during this period that such large sites as BANTEAY CHOEU near ANGKOR and BANTEAY PREI NOKOR were occupied.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_KhChenl]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ confederated state ♥</b> 'Many historians believe that for virtually all of the 'Chen-la' period there was no one major kingdom of the Khmers but an arena of principalities in competition. Thus, at one extreme we have before us the suggestion in the Chinese sources that the Khmers were subjects of a single unitary state, Chen-la, which spilt into two for a period in the eighth century, and at the other we have the view of 'Chen-la' as an area of competing transient chiefdoms. It is clear at least that certain kings were able to assert their control over a great part of the Khmer territory, and it has recently been suggested by Michael Vickery that there was indeed for most of the seventh and eighth centuries just one main centre of power.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_KhChenl] Coedes and other scholars have called attention to a passage in the early eighth-century 'History of the Sui Dynasty' that may be a specific reference to this cult [i.e., the cult surrounding Lingaparvata centred at the temple complex of Wat Phu]. In speaking of 'Zhenla' it states: "Near the capital is a mountain named Ling-jia-bo-po, on the summit of which a temple is constructed, always guarded by five thousand soldiers and consecrated to the spirit named Po-do-li, to whom human sacrifices are made. Each year, the king himself goes to this temple to make a human sacrifice during the night. It is thus that they honour the spirits." According to Coedes, a long-time believer in the reality of 'funan' and 'Zhenla', Champassak was the place where the ruling dynasty of 'Zhenla' originated, and Wat Phu was the first capital of what he took to be a unitary state--a view not accepted by modern scholarshi [...] As for the human sacrifice mentioned in the Chinese annals, this was not entirely absent in Cambodia before the French Protectorate -- for instance, right up until the mid-nineteenth century, humans were crushed alive under the gate foundations of every fortified enclosure, of which they became the guardian spirits.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_KhChenl] 'Although the Chinese histories mentioned two distinct kingdoms in the eighth century, the study of Sanskrit and Old Khmer inscriptions has revealed a far more complex political struc- ture, with largely autonomous city-states controlling particular areas of rice-growing land or particular stretches of the Mekong Valley. The rulers of these city-states were only the most conspicuous and sometimes arbitrary represen- tatives of a highly stratified and largely perma- nent local bureaucracy, whose members enjoyed inherited status and performed particular duties within the society. It was clearly exceptional for a large number of city-states to be combined under one ruler, and only rarely were embassies sent to China as a mark of this status (or of the ambition to achieve it).'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_KhChenl] 'The question is whether Chenla was a unified state, or whether Cambodia was divided into a number of principalities in the sixth, seventh and eighth centuries; probably the latter is the case. As Vickery points out, there was an ‘explosion’ of Khmer epigraphy from the seventh century, with the earliest recorded Khmer stone inscription dating from 612 AD at Angkor Borei. None of this refers to what the Chinese called Chenla. Probably, the decline of Funan was relative, with power devolv- ing to a multiplicity of petty kingdoms along the Mekong.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_KhChenl] 'Chinese histories record that a state called Chenla sent an embassy to China in 616 or 617 C.E. The History of the Sui Dynasty (Sui-shu) noted that Chenla was originally a vassal of FUNAN in Cambodia, but under its ruler Citrasena conquered Funan and gained independence. Sub- sequent references described further missions to the Chinese court; the descriptions give the impression that it was a unified state under a king, which had defeated and absorbed Funan. During the early eighth century, the his- tories record that Chenla was divided into two states, labeled Land Chenla and Water Chenla, respectively.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_KhChenl]&nbsp;:'An inscription from the small sanctuary of Kdei Ang illustrates how original documents provide an insight into the actual transition from Funan to Chenla. Written in 667 C.E., the inscription names successive members of an elite family of court officials. It begins with Brahmadatta, a retainer of King RUDRAVARMAN of Funan (c. 514-50). His maternal nephews, Dharmadeva and Simhadeva, served the kings Bhavavarman and Mahendravarman. Simhavira, a maternal nephew of Dharmadeva, was an official under King Ishanavarman (r. c. 615-37). Finally, Simhadatta served King JAYAVARMAN I (c. 635-80). This dynasty of rulers is the major, but not only, evidence for central royal authority. However, by following the rulers’ history, it is possible to trace the development of increasingly central- ized state authority. '[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_KhChenl] 'ISHANAVARMAN OF CHENLA seems to have exercised author- ity over a wide area, as many regional leaders acknowl- edged him as their overlord. One text from 250 kilometers (150 mi.) south of his capital records how the local mag- nate Ishanadatta referred to the heroic and illustrious Ishanavarman. An inscription from ISHANAPURA itself describes the valor and military prowess of Ishanavarman, a king “who extended the territory of his parents.” He was succeeded by his son, Bhavavarman II, about whom little is known except that from the region of Ishanapura he continued to maintain control over most if not all of his father’s fiefs. It is intriguing that a series of inscriptions dating to his reign record foundations by local leaders without any reference to this king, a situation that might well indicate their independence. Jayavarman I was the great-grandson of Ishanavarman. His inscriptions indicate the tightening of central power and control over a considerable area, the creation of new titles and admin- istrators, and the availability of an army, the means of defense and destruction. A text described how King Jayavarman’s commands were obeyed by “innumerable vassal kings.” Jayavarman also strengthened the legal code: “Those who levy an annual tax, those who seize carts, boats, slaves, cattle, buffaloes, those who contest the king’s orders, will be punished.” New titles were accorded highly ranked retainers who fulfilled important posts in government. One lineage held the priestly posi- tion of hotar. Another functionary was a samantagajapadi, chief of the royal elephants, and a military leader; the dhanyakarapati would have controlled the grain stores. The king also appointed officials known as a mratan and pon to a sabha, or council of state. Another inscription prescribes the quantities of salt to be distributed by barge to various foundations and prohibits any tax on the ves- sels going up- or downriver. Thus Jayavarman I intensi- fied royal control over dependent fiefs begun by his great-grandfather, Ishanavarman. Thereafter this dynasty loses visibility, although the king’s daughter, Jayadevi, ruled from a center in the vicinity of ANGKOR.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_KhChenl] 'There was no single state or ruler at this time, but rather a series of competing micro city states.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_KhChenl] 'Both must be treated with caution, for if the Chinese texts were our only source of information, we would assume that a state called Chenla existed in this area'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_KhChenl] 'Their contents inform us on two vital issues. The first is the use of official titles, such as President of the Royal Court, which was located at a centre called Purandarapura. Another prescribed punishment for those who disobey a royal order. Two brothers of high social standing were appointed to a variety of posts: officer of the royal guard, chief of rowers, military chief, and governor of Dhruvapura. Another highly-ranked courtier became chief of elephants, reminding us of the traditional role of elephants in warfare. A further text mentions a chief of the royal grain store. These high officials were rewarded with honorific symbols, such as a parasol embellished with gold. The trends already evident under Ishanavarman were greatly strengthened under his great grandson: with Jayavarman I, we can identify the establishment of a state. It was, however, ephemeral. Only one inscription of his daughter Jayadevi survives. Thereafter, the dynasty disappears from the historic record.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_KhChenl] 'We should not be deluded by Chinese references to a state of Chenla. Wolters (1974) and Dupont (1943-6) have both shown convincingly that hegemony over most Chenla centres was the exception rather than the rule, and may have been achieved only briefly unde rIshanavarman and more firmly by his great grandson Jayavarman I.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_KhChenl]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥</b> 'Originally a vassal to the kingdom of Funan, its King Chitrasena seized Funan and subdued it.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_KhChenl]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Funan II ♥</b> 'Six Funanese tributary missions to China are recorded as arriving during the third century.

Of these languages, only Khmer and Mon possess alphabets of their own.The Mons and the Khmers are also the only speakers of Austroasiatic languages to practice settled agri- culture. The earliest evidence of written Khmer comes from an inscription incised in southern Cambodia of the seventh century C.E., using an alphabet derived from southern India, which, in modified form, remains in use in contemporary Cambodia. The Thais adapted the alphabet for their own use in the thirteenth century C.E.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_51_KhChenl] 'Thus Michael Vickery has summarized the many refer- ences in the inscriptions to local gods worshiped in Chenla temples. The local matrilineal descent system continued, and the Khmer language took its place along- side SANSKRIT in the inscriptions. Vickery prefers the notion of an Indic veneer, wherein the elites in society selectively adopted those Indian traits that suited their objectives. These included the SANSKRIT language for per- sonal and place names, the Indian script, and architec- tural styles. These elements contributed to the increasingly strong divisions in society that signal the formation of states, but the essential characteristics of the Chenla kingdoms were Khmer.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_52_KhChenl] 'The archaeological hardware of these vital centuries is provided by the surviving temples, reservoirs and rice fields, but the social software has to be teased out of the surviving inscriptions.

They regularly refer to a ruler or the title and name of a local grandee associated with the temple foundation and its maintenance.

But there are also seven specifically Buddhist inscriptions: K. 828, K. 49, K. 505, K. 755, K. 163, K. 244, and K. 132."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_56_KhChenl]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Genus ♣ Buddhism ♥</b> "[T]here does appear to have been a considerable expansion of the Mahayana throughout the South- east Asian region from the mid-eighth century, perhaps as a result of the spon- sorship of the Pàla kings of northeast India and the growing influence of Nà- landà university."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_57_KhChenl]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Family ♣ Mahayana ♥</b> "[T]here does appear to have been a considerable expansion of the Mahayana throughout the South- east Asian region from the mid-eighth century, perhaps as a result of the spon- sorship of the Pàla kings of northeast India and the growing influence of Nà- landà university."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_58_KhChenl]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion ♣ ♥</b>Chenla Principalities (red) 679 CE [MAJIDBENAM_REF_59_KhChenl]</div><ul class="gallery mw-gallery-traditional">		<li class="gallerybox" style="width: 155px"><div style="width: 155px">			<div class="thumb" style="width: 150px;"><div style="margin:15px auto;"><a href="/w/index.php?title=File:Chenla.png" class="image"><img alt="" src="/w/images/thumb/b/b0/Chenla.png/76px-Chenla.png" width="76" height="120"></a></div></div>			<div class="gallerytext"><div>Chenla (green) 500-800 CE [MAJIDBENAM_REF_60_KhChenl]</div>			</div>		</div></li></ul><div>According to Chinese records, Chenla (also known as Zhenla)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_61_KhChenl] was the polity that ruled over much of mainland Southeast Asia after the decline of Funan.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_62_KhChenl] As with Funan, this was likely not a unitary state, but rather a cluster of competing small city-states.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_63_KhChenl] These states occupied much of modern Cambodia and northwestern Thailand, with sites all across the Mekong River Basin, and particularly dense clusters just before the river's delta, in the Tonlé Sap region, and in the Upper Mun Valley.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_64_KhChenl] With respect to Chenla's chronological boundaries, many authors date its beginning to the mid-6th century,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_65_KhChenl] that is, at the beginning of Funan's century-long decline.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_66_KhChenl] This is the chronology we follow, although it is worth noting that, according to the Chinese records, Chenla only conquered Funan in the 7th century.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_67_KhChenl] The Chenla era came to a close at the turn of the the 9th century with the beginning of the Angkor period, traditionally dated from Jayavarman II's coronation ceremony in 802 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_68_KhChenl][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Population and political organization[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Although Chenla was probably a cluster of competing centres rather than a unitary polity, inscriptions suggest that there was an overall political hierarchy, at the top of which sat a <i>vrah kamraten</i>, that is, most likely, a deified ruler[MAJIDBENAM_REF_69_KhChenl] Below this ruler, there was a series of elite ranks whose relationship to each other is not always clear, though no rank was higher than that of <i>pura</i>.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_70_KhChenl] At the local level, <i>poñ</i> (settlement chiefs) exercised their authority over individual temples, which were important economic as well as ritual centres for their sustaining populace.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_71_KhChenl][MAJIDBENAM_BR]No overall population estimates could be found in the literature, but the largest settlement probably housed over 20,000 families,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_72_KhChenl] and Chinese records describe Chenla as 'a wealthy and militarily powerful country with over 30 cities'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_73_KhChenl]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Chenla ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Chen_La_600CE: 550CE-699CE; Chen_La_700CE: 700CE-799CE; Chen_La_800CE: 800CE-825CE ♥</b>  Chen_La_600CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_74_KhChenl] Chen_La_700CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_75_KhChenl] Chen_La_800CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_76_KhChenl]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  326833: 550CE-699CE;  583382: 700CE-799CE;  296789: 800CE-825CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Austroasiatic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Khmericic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Old Khmer ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Hinduism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Shaivism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition ♣ Buddhism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religion Family ♣ Mahayana Buddhism ♥</b></div></body></html>
