The chiefdoms during this period are also more complex than in the preceding San José and Guadalupe phases.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_MxRosar][MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_MxRosar]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ quasi-polity ♥</b> The largest of the three chiefdoms in the valley at this time was in the Etla arm and consisted of 18-20 villages focused around the central settlement (San José Mogote).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_MxRosar] It is assumed that this network of settlements formed a complex chiefdom because of their proximity and hierarchy in relation to San José Mogote (the largest settlement). It is unlikely that there were alliances between the three chiefdoms based on evidence for violence and inter-village raiding between the three arms of the valley.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_MxRosar]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥</b> The three chiefdoms were separate entities with no evidence for supra-polity relations.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_MxRosar]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ MxSanGu ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b> The highest density of population continued to be in the Etla arm, with San José Mogote as the central settlement. The other arms of the valley, which were previously occupied, increased in population density and formed chiefdoms.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_MxRosar]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ MxAlb1E ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ Middle Formative ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣ [100-200] ♥</b>km squared. Similar pottery styles and symbols of prestige were shared between the Valley of Oaxaca and neighbouring Tehuacan Valley during this period, suggesting some interaction or cultural "system" which extended the distance between the valleys.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_MxRosar]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ San José Mogote ♥</b> San José Mogote was the largest site in the valley at this time, and may have been the central site of the chiefdom in the Etla arm.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_MxRosar] Other smaller chiefly centers were Yegüih (in the eastern arm) and San Martin Tilcajete (in the southern arm).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_MxRosar][MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_MxRosar]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ ♥</b> There are no written records from this phase, but later evidence shows that people in the valley spoke Zapotec, possibly from the succeeding San José Mogote phase, and the Otomanguean language families may have split before the start of this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_MxRosar]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic Family ♣ Proto-Otomanguean ♥</b> Both the Zapotecan (Zapotec and Chatino) and Mixtecan (Mixtec, Cuicatec and Trique) languages belong to the Otomanguean language family, which also includes: Otopamean, Chinantecan Popolocan, Huave, Amuzgo and Manguean language groups.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_MxRosar]. These language groups diverged between around 2100 BCE-1400 CE but it is not known exactly when each language or dialect split . It is however likely that Zapotecan and Mixtecan had diverged by 3700 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_MxRosar]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language Genus ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious Tradition ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Sect ♣ ♥</b>During the Rosario phase (700-500 BCE), the settlement of San José Mogote continued to be the largest settlement in the Valley of Oaxaca. However, other settlements rose to challenge its primacy: Huitzo (at the extreme northern end of the Etla arm), Tilcajete (in the Valle Grande), and Yegüih (in the Tlacolula arm), each the centre of a cluster of smaller settlements.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_MxRosar] There is evidence for increased inter-settlement conflict and social differentiation within communities.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_MxRosar] Burnt remains of buildings have been found at Rosario phase sites, which, along with evidence for fortifications and the extensive unoccupied 'buffer zone' of 80 square kilometres between the polities, suggest inter-settlement raids and hostility at this time.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_MxRosar][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]While there is evidence of an emerging elite during this period, the nature of leadership and political organization remains unclear.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_MxRosar] Labour was organized for the construction of large public structures and elaborate tombs. However, the types of buildings constructed led archaeologists Kent Flannery and Joyce Marcus to suggest that elites could not yet draw on labour and resources solely for their own personal gain.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_MxRosar][MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_MxRosar] The first evidence of monumental art, calendars, writing and human sacrifice in the Valley of Oaxaca dates to this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_MxRosar] Population estimates for the three polities in the valley at this time range from 1000 to 2000 people; the largest population was concentrated in the northern arm, with San José Mogote as the primary centre.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_MxRosar][MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_MxRosar]</div></body></html>
