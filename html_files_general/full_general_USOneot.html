Small quantities of European trade goods appear in the Illinois archaeological record around the beginning of the 17th century CE, marking the beginning of the 'protohistoric' period in this region.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_USOneot][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Oneota society was relatively egalitarian, more so than the preceding Mississippian cultures: there is a lack of evidence from Oneota settlements or funerary contexts for inherited status or class distinctions.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_USOneot] It has been suggested that political leadership was provided by 'big men', who relied on informal support from village populations and could not pass on their positions to their children.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_USOneot][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Reliable estimates for the size of the Oneota population between 1400 and 1650 CE are lacking.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_USOneot]</div></body></html>
