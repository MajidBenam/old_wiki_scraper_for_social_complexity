The fourth phase is contemporary with the Orientalizing period of Etruscan civilization, and the third phase is transitional between the second and fourth phases. LC I is characterized by simple undecorated pottery and cremation as the dominant funerary rite, while in LC II cremation is replaced by inhumation, and pottery is decorated with simple patterns. Foreign influences can be detected in the pottery of LC III, and in the fourth and final phase both foreign pottery and its local imitations are represented.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_ItLatIA] Major sites include Osteria dell'Osa and Castel di Decima.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]It is difficult to reconstruct the exact political organization of Iron Age settlements in Latium. At Osteria dell'Osa, one of the most well studied LC II sites  likely inhabited by between one and three hundred people, the distribution and quality of grave goods suggest that status was largely determined by age and gender. Men were usually buried with weapons, women with weaving equipment and jewellery, and the elderly with drinking cups. LC III and IV burials provide evidence for increasing social differentiation, a decrease in the importance of gender and age for determining status, and greater receptivity to external (i.e. Greek and Etruscan) influences. Most of the burials at Castel di Decima (LC III and IV) are quite simple inhumations, with no or modest grave goods, but a minority of graves are accompanied by high-quality goods such as amber beads, gold fibulae, and even chariots. The wealth of this minority appears to increase throughout the 8th and 7th centuries.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_ItLatIA][MAJIDBENAM_BR]There appear to be no reliable estimates for the overall population of Latium at this time. However, a few estimates exist for the population size of settlements. At one extreme, some sources suggest that thousands of people lived at some Iron Age settlements.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_ItLatIA] However, Osteria dell'Osa likely only had between one and three hundred inhabitants.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_ItLatIA]</div></body></html>
