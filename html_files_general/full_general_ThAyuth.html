"To a generation that, in the 1780s and 1790s, was looking back at Ayudhya, the reign of Borommakot must have seemed a sort of golden age, an ideal to be recaptured. There was much about Borommakot's reign that accorded with traditional ideas of the virtues of good kings and so won him acclaim". During Borommakot's reign, Ayutthaya succeeded Ceylon as "the preeminent center of Buddhism" ("a party of eighteen Siamese monks was dispatched to Kandy to reordain Singhalese monks and establish what was to become a Siam order of monks on Ceylon", in response to a 1751 mission "from Ceylon requesting aid in restoring Singhalese Buddhism, which had declined under Portuguese and Dutch rule"). Moreover, Ayutthaya consolidated its control over Cambodia, and established peaceful relations with Burma.

The offer was refused, for from the Chinese point of view it would have been demeaning, and an admission of Chinese weakness, to have accepted. In the mandala world of Southeast Asia, however, it was usual for an ally to contribute military assistance in time of war. Narasuan may have hoped for some quid pro quo in his own conflict with the Burmese, but his offer, and the Ming refusal, point to essential differences in worldview.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_ThAyuth]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Ayutthaya ♥</b> In 1569, after a protracted military campaign, Burmese forces took the capital and "installed the obsequious Maha Thammaracha as vassal king of Ayudhya"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_ThAyuth].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b> In 1569, after a protracted military campaign, Burmese forces took the capital and "installed the obsequious Maha Thammaracha as vassal king of Ayudhya"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_ThAyuth].

As the Han armies came to control China's southern coastline in the first few centuries AD, some of these peoples retreated into the high valleys in the hills behind the coast. Then, over many centuries, some moved westwards, spreading Tai language dialects along a 1000-kilometre arc from the Guanxi interior to the Brahmaputra valley. They probably took with them some expertise in growing rice using the water flow from mountain streams."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_ThAyuth]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Tai-Kadai ♥</b> "However, it is generally maintained that there are four major language families in the region: Austronesian (with two major sub-groups, Formosan and Malayo-Polynesian), Austroasiatic (or Mon-Khmer), Tai-Kadai, and Sino-Tibetan. This classification is based on genetic relationships; in other words, languages grouped together in the same overarching language family are assumed to share some common characteristics, which are attributed to a postulated common ancestor or protolanguage (Amara Prasithrathsint 1993: 76-77). [...] Eventually the Tai language now known as "Thai" became dominant in the Chao Phraya basin. Yet the language itself suggests that various groups blended into this area's society. Thai has absorbed  so many basic words, grammatical rules, and syntactical principles from Khmer (and possibly from Mon too) that it is sharply different from any other language in the Tai family (one linguist dubbed it Khmero-Tai)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_ThAyuth][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Ayutthaya (yellow) 1748 CE[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_ThAyuth] NOTE: This map should probably be replaced, as it Ayutthaya's tributary states (including Cambodia) are presented as if they were independent polities, no different from Vietnam or Burma.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The city of Ayutthaya was founded in 1351 CE in the Chao Phraya Basin, in modern-day Thailand, and soon emerged as a dominant force in the region, turning neighbouring <i>mueang</i>, or city-states, into its tributaries.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_ThAyuth] This was largely thanks to its advantageous geographical position, which allowed it to become an <i>entrepôt</i> where goods could be exchanged between China to the east, India and Arabia to the west, and the Malay archipelago to the south.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_ThAyuth] In 1569, Ayutthaya fell to the Burmese army.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_ThAyuth] Here, we only consider the second phase of the polity's history, starting in 1593, when Ayutthaya regained its independence after defeating Burma at the Battle of Nong Sarai.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_ThAyuth] The kingdom flourished throughout the 17th century, regaining its status as the dominant political and economic power of mainland Southeast Asia and ruling over Khmer, Lao, Lanna, and Shan.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_ThAyuth] The polity may have reached its peak under King Borommakot (reigned 1733‒1758): during this time, Ayutthaya faced no serious external threats (indeed, it made peace with Burma and consolidated its hold over Cambodia), and supplanted Sri Lanka as the preeminent centre of Buddhist culture.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_ThAyuth] Shortly afterwards, however, hostilities with Burma resumed due to the ambitions of a new Burmese dynasty. In 1767, Ayutthaya was once again captured ‒ and this time, it was destroyed.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_ThAyuth][MAJIDBENAM_BR]A number of different spellings of Ayutthaya are in use, including Ayuthaya, Ayudhya, and Ayuthia.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_ThAyuth][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the Ayutthaya Kingdom, kings ruled over a society composed of a 'service nobility of maybe 2000 people and their families, and a mass of people bound to surrender some or all of their labour to the elite'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_ThAyuth] There was a four-part administrative structure: one ministry was dedicated to the palace and the capital; one to military affairs and relations with tributary states and cities; one to trade, the treasury, and foreign communities; and one, made up of Brahmans, to ritual, astrology, and records.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_ThAyuth][MAJIDBENAM_BR]It is difficult to give a firm figure for the population of the kingdom as a whole. However, Ayutthaya may have been the largest city in Southeast Asia in the 17th and 18th centuries,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_ThAyuth] with perhaps 150,000 inhabitants in 1700 and 160,000 in 1750.
