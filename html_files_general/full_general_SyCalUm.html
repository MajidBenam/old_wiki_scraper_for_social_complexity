[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_SyCalUm] In Egypt the adoption of Arabic as the language of local government took over 100 years. Initially almost all papyruses were written in Greek. 643 CE saw the first bilingual Greek-Arabic document and 719 the last. Earliest known Arabic only document is dated 709 CE.

The central government of the Umayyad Caliphate was almost non-existent at the start of the period but entered a more developed stage in the mid-8th century. One of the reasons for this lack of central administration was the exceptionally successful Arab-Muslim army combined with the existence of functioning bureaucracies in the former Sassanid and Byzantine domains, which were left largely intact.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_SyCalUm] Thus, under Muawiya - the first Ummayad Caliph - the  ruler was 'surrounded by Arab chiefs' with no other central administration.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_SyCalUm] At Damascus, an administrative system staffed by permanent officials[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_SyCalUm] dates from the reigns of al-Malik (685-705 CE) and al-Walid (705-715 CE).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_SyCalUm][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The caliphs, from their residence in Damascus (661-744 CE) and then Harran (744-750 CE), employed a chamberlain to manage visitors and regulate daily affairs,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_SyCalUm] and maintained an office of the chancery[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_SyCalUm] with officials called <i>diwans</i> to manage the collection of taxes and payment of salaries.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_SyCalUm] In order to impose their authority over the provinces, which had a combined population of up to 33 million,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_SyCalUm] the Umayyads typically sent civil and military governors (<i>amel</i> and <i>amir</i>).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_SyCalUm] In the regions they conquered, the Ummayads had no choice but to use the resident staff because institutions to train and educate bureaucrats had not yet developed in the Arab Muslim context. In Egypt, for the first century of Umayyad rule, 'all the provincial officials were Christians'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_SyCalUm] The Umayyad Caliphate was thus an exceptionally multicultural empire with a diverse governmental and cultural heritage.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]This diversity was reflected in the number of languages spoken across the territory conquered by Muslims: from Basque in the far west to Berber and African Romance languages along the southern shores of the Mediterranean, and Aramaic, Turkic, Hebrew, Armenian and Kurdish in the east.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_SyCalUm] The use of Arabic as an administrative language began in Iraq in 697 CE, but spread outwards to Syria, Egypt and, by 700 CE, Khurasan in modern-day northeastern Iran.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_SyCalUm] In Egypt, the adoption of Arabic as the language of local government took over 100 years; initially, almost all papyruses were written in Greek. The first known bilingual Greek-Arabic document dates to 643 CE, and the last to 719. The earliest known Egyptian document written exclusively in Arabic is dated to 709 CE, and Greek was still being used up until 780 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_SyCalUm]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Ummayad Caliphate ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ UmayyadCaliphate_700CE: 661CE-750CE ♥</b>  UmayyadCaliphate_700CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_SyCalUm]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  7673891: 661CE-750CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Afro-Asiatic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Semitic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Arabic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Islam ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Sunni Islam ♥</b></div></body></html>
