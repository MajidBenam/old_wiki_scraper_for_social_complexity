The apex of the constituional system - the doge, the Provveditori di San Marco, the ducal councilors, the Savi del Consiglio - thus came to be subjected to a form of continuous supervision. In 1453, for example, the avogadori were able to block an order from the Doge to the Giudici di Petizion."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_ItVenR3][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Part Two on The Imperial Expansion begins with the election of Pietro as the Doge of Venice in 1205 CE.

The three Esecutori could proceed with a firm hand, torturing the accused and working in secret. The crime of blasphemy had, in fact, brought the divine wrath upon the city of St Mark: in order to regain God's benevolence ... it was necessary to prosecute them vigorously. A later law of the Ten in 1539, demonstrating the magistracy's success in uprooting blasphemy, decreed the extension of these norms to 'dens' and 'brothels' which, in addition to these offenses to God, gave rise to 'other enormous and detestable sins, along with gambling' with the consequent ruin of both people and their finances."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_ItVenR3][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"In the years between 1580 and 1620, the processes of differentiation within the patriciate accelerated".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_ItVenR3]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ unitary state ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Venetian Republic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Venetian Republic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ Christiandom ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Venice ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Italian ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b></div></body></html>
