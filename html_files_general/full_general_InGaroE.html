The Garo Hills district is bounded by Goalpara and part of the Mymensing district of East Pakistan on the north and the west, by Mymensing on the south, and by the Khasi and Jaintia Hills district on the east. The district covers an area of 3,160.6 square miles and has a population of 2,42,075 according to the 1951 census; of this population 1,90,702 are Garos while the rest are non-Garos.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_InGaroE] ‘The Garo Hills, the main homeland of the Garos, is the south-western district of Assam. Its area is about 3,152 sq. miles, and its population according to the 1951 census is 2,42,075 including the non-Garo population. The total Garo population of the district is 1,97,077 of whom 1,02,821 are males and 94,256 females. The area lies between 25 ° 57′ 18″ and 25 ° 9′ 20″ north latitude and 91 ° 0′ 0″ and 90 ° 0′ 10″ east longitude.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_InGaroE] Due to the post-independence administrative reorganization of the region, the A’chik Hills districts now belong to the state of Meghalaya, bordering Assam: ‘The two Garo Hills districts are situated between 25 degrees, 9 minutes and 26 degrees, 1 minute north latitude and 89 degrees, 49 minutes and 91 degrees, 2 minutes east longitude, covering an area of 8,000 square kilometers. The districts border Bangladesh on the south and west and Assam on the north. Hills cover most of the district, with plains along the fringes. There are a number of hilly streams and rivers; excepting for the Simsang River which forms a wide flood plain none is navigable. The monsoon area produces a thick vegetation on the hills.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_InGaroE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Original name ♣ Achik; Mande ♥</b> 'Garo' is the most frequently used term in the ethnographic literature.

Therefore, out of respect, we generally prefer “A'chik” instead of "Garo", except for source titles and direct quotations. ‘The Garos constitute one of the most important tribal communities in East and West Garo Hills. The Garos call themselves A’chik (Hill man), Mande (Man) or A’chik Mande. Ethnically, the Garos belong the the Tibeto-Burman race, whose cradle is said to have been North-West China, between the upper waters of Yang-tse Kiang and Hoang-Ho. The Garos have a close affinity with the Bodos, Kacharis, Kochs and such allied tribes of Assam valley.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_InGaroE] ‘As stated earlier, the Garos prefer to call themselves as “A’chik or A’chik manderang” and as such, the appropriate term for their land will be “A’chik A’song” or “A’chik Land”.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_InGaroE] ‘The word ‘Mande’ generally indicated ‘human being’ to differentiate from other beings as ‘Mande or Matburung’ (man or animal) and “Mande or Me’mang” (man or ghost). It is exceptionally used in rare cases to indicate the whole community from others like ‘Mandema ba Rori’ ‘Mandema Nepali’ that is whether hill man or plain people and Nepali.

They are one of the best known matrilineal groups in India. Here the Garos are not the only aboriginal tribe--they are the MAJOR aboriginal tribe. Others are the Hajong, the Koch, the Rabha, the Dalau, and the Banais who reside on the adjacent plains of the neighboring district. There remains an obscurity about the origin of the word 'Garo.' They are known as 'Garos' to outsiders; but the Garos always designate themselves as 'Achik' ('hill man'). The Garos are divided into nine subtribes: the Awe, Chisak, Matchi-Dual, Matabeng, Ambeng, Ruga-Chibox, Gara-Ganching, Atong, and the Megam. These are geographic subtribes, but are also dialectal and subcultural groups.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_InGaroE] ‘Linguistic affinities and personal traits clearly show that the Garos are only a division of the great Bodo race of Assam. The Bodos were spread, as at present, throughout the whole of the Brahmaputra valley as well as in North Bengal. Aryans are now generally believed to have entered into Assam by two routes, one leading from the west through the Gangetic valley and the other through the Himalayas along the courses of the rivers entering Assam. The Bodos who were the earlier inhabitants of the province also came here in different hordes and following different routes from the north-west as well as from the north-east. It  may be supposed that the Bodos, before entering into Assam and North Bengal which might have been then a part of Assam (Kamrupa of Old), divided themselves into groups somewhere in the Himalayan kingdom of Tibet. I think the ancestors of the Garos of Assam came down from Tibet to Bhutan and thence by following the course of the river Sonkos and her tributaries to Dhubri (now headquarters of the district of Goalpara) and this might be the latest migration of the people of the Bodo race into Assam and North Bengal. These people then crossed the Brahmaputra at different points and populated the southern parts of Goalpara, the northern and the western parts of the Garo Hills and then gradually they spread in the entire Garo Hills and some parts of the Kamrup district.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_InGaroE] ’Linguistically and ethnologically, the Garos belong to the Bodo family, who were one-time occupants of a large part of the Brahmaputra valley but were probably pushed into the hills by later invaders. The Garos strongly believe that their ancestors came from Tibet and settled in Cooch Behar for about 400 years.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_InGaroE] ‘The denomination of these linguistic speakers was subsequently driven away by the Tibeto- Burman hordes into Khasi Hills and the Jaintia Hills. This is the only part of the North East India in which this sub-family exists now. The three groups of the Tibeto-Burman family like Kuki-Chin and Naga were driven to the North-Eastern Hills. The Bodo dominated in the plains of Garo Hills and the North Cachar Hills. They were later subdivided into Garo, Kachari, Mech, Dimasa, Tippera, Lalung, Chutiya and Rabha groups (Barkakati 1969). Playfair ( c.f. Barkakati, 1969) writes that the Garo and the Kachari originally belonged to one group before splitting into two  groups-one group over the Southern bank of Brahmaputra and the other Kachar, spreading over the North Garo Hills. The latter was occupied by the British in the year 1872. Prior to this the area was administered as a part of Bengal. The area became a part of Assam in 1874, when it was carved out as a separate province.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_InGaroE] ‘The non-Garo settled population of the district consists of the Hajong, Koch, Dalu and Rabha (All excepting the Hajong are Bodo speaking tribes). The Hajong have adopted the Jharua dialect of Assamese and have been greatly Hinduized. The Dalu are closely akin to the Hajong but they are recent migrants from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). These people inhabit the outer fringes of the district extending to the adjacent areas of the neighbouring plains districts. They are in occupation of the fertile agricultural lands suitable for wet paddy cultivation. There is also a small number of settled Muslim population (nearly 5% of the total population of the district according to 1961 census) in the north-eastern tip of the district adjacent to the Dhubri subdivision of the Goalpara district and to the district of Rongpur of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh).’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_InGaroE] We have followed eHRAF in the grouping of Bodo Peoples with South Asia [MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_InGaroE].
