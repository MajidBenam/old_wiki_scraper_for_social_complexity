Source: wiki commons</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Mongols began as one of a group of nomadic tribes living on the Central Asian Steppe. Temujin or Temuchin (later called Chinggis Khan) became Khan (king), united the different Mongol families and incorporated other tribes such as the Tatars into the 'Mongols'. He was acknowledged as the leader of all the Central Asian tribes in 1206 CE.  With this force he moved out of the Steppe in search of new territory. First, the Mongols attacked northern China between 1211 and 1215 CE. In 1218 they moved west into Iran, attacking the main cities of the region.  They attacked southern Russia in 1240 and the German lands in 1241. The empire did not expand any further into Europe, but turned its attention back to China and the Middle East. Khubilai Khan moved into southern China; Hulegu captured Baghdad and destroyed the Abbasid caliphate. This represented the height of the Empire in terms of territory and achievement. Indeed, so vast was this empire that the Mongols split it into four regions under four Khans: the Golden Horde in Russia, the Chagatai Khanate in Central Asia, the Great Yuan in China and the Ilkhanate in Iran and Iraq, c. 1300. Over time this became independent dynasties and states. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_MnMngKh] The Mongols were able to mobilise large numbers of troops for their armies. All adult males under 60 were eligible for mass mobilization. All were required to provide their own horses and equipment. This meant that even though Mongol soldiers may not have been the best troops in terms of ability or equipment, they had advantages of size and discipline over their opponents. This was strengthened by Chinggis Khan reforms which introduced a decimal system of organising the army - diving up troops up into units from ten to 10, 000.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_MnMngKh]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Mongol Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Mongol_Empire_1200CE: 1206CE-1270CE ♥</b>  Mongol_Empire_1200CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_MnMngKh]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  2214258: 1206CE-1270CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Mongolic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Eastern Mongolic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Mongolian ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Shamanism: 1300CE; Islam: 1400CE ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Mongolian Shamanism: 1300CE ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition ♣ Islam: 1300CE; Tengrism: 1400CE ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition2 ♣ Tengrism: 1300CE; Shamanism: 1400CE ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religion Family2 ♣ Mongolian Shamanism: 1400CE ♥</b></div></body></html>
