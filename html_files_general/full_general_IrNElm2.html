Sources disagree as to his success: the Assyrian's claim it as a victory for themselves, while the Babylonians claim victory for Humban-nikash I. Being the least invested in the outcome of the battle, the Babylonian source is generally believed. It suggests he beat the Assyrian's in battle which lead to a decade of peace. After his death royal political power appears to begin to diffuse to regional power.

Neo-Elamite II ends 646 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_IrNElm2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Neo-Elamite II (743-647 BCE). The Elamite historical record is very limited, but Neo-Babylonian and Assyrian documents record the presence of Elamite armies in the battles against Assyria dating from around 820 BCE. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_IrNElm2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]640 BCE is generally considered the end of the Neo-Elamite kingdom. Traditional academic belief is that in this year Susa was sacked by the Assyrian army. Ashurbanipal's texts describe fierce looting of the city. Susa was destroyed and the Neo- Elamite Kingdom ended. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_IrNElm2] However, more evidence is appearing to suggest that the Elamite Kingdom may have continued after the attacks of 640 BCE. For example, a few names of what are thought to be post 640 BCE Elamite kings are known.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_IrNElm2] Also, archaeological evidence of material culture does not show any discontinuity over this period . [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_IrNElm2] <i> 3. what is the archaeological evidence? be specific if specifics are available so what the code is based on is obvious. however - specifics aren't always available so if they're not available write what you can.  </i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR] Evidence of continuity: the Assyrian sack of Susa 'has dominated the traditional interpretative model for the end of Elamite civilization. However, the material, textual, and artistic assemblages at Susa, together with the reliefs from Izeh/Malamir (KF [Kul-e Farah] I, c.650-550 BC), Naqsh-e Rustam (c.674-626 BC), and the elite material from Arjan (c.600-570 BC) and Ram Hormuz (c.585-539 BC) provide evidence of the survival of Elamite political power, culture, and traditions after the Assyrian raids on western Elam.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_IrNElm2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ unitary state; confederated state ♥</b> unitary state: 820-693 BCE; confederated state: 693-640 BCE  In 693 BCE, the new king Kudur Nahhunte relocated his residence from Susa to Madaktu, likely a marginal stronghold, and later Hidalu. These areas had little administrative power and as a result local autonomy increased significantly throughout the rest of the Neo-Elamite Kingdom. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_IrNElm2] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_IrNElm2] Liveracki suggests that the Assyrian king set three Median princes as kings in the three capitals (Susa, Madaktu and Hidalu) after the battle of 653 BCE, thus further dispersing power. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_IrNElm2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Without exaggeration, the Elamite federated system of government can be considered as perhaps the earliest formal federalism on a large scale in history."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_IrNElm2] In 653 BCE the Assyrian army defeated the Elamite army and beheaded the king; thereafter, Elamite became a vassal state to Assyria, with an appointed Assyrian on the Elamite throne.

Whether or not the coming of the Iranians caused the divided provinces of Elam to support the rise of a new centralized authority in south-west Iran is a question which cannot be answered on present evidence. Whatever the reason, by c.742 BC Humbannikash I had become king of an apparently reconstituted Elamite federation."
