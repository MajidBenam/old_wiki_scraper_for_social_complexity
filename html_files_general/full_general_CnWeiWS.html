The development of trade, occupational complexity, and markets created a class of merchants and private landlords.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_CnWeiWS] Iron tools were used for agriculture and the use of irrigation and fertilizer became more widespread.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_CnWeiWS] Intellectualism flourished, with the rise of Confucian philosophers Mengzi and Xunzi.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_CnWeiWS][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the 5th century BCE, the state of Jin was divided into three states: Wei, Han and Zhao. Wei was one of the largest states of the period, ruling parts of modern Shanxi and later expanding to cover western Shandong and northern and western Henan.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_CnWeiWS] During the Warring States period, Wei mounted a number of successful military campaigns against neighbouring states, but fell into decline after a loss to Qi in 341 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_CnWeiWS][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Warring States period ended with the rise of the Qin state and its defeat of the imperial Zhou court.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_CnWeiWS] Qin conquered the state of Wei in 225 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_CnWeiWS][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Several of China's major political institutions were created during the Warring States Period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_CnWeiWS] Zhou rulers were replaced by strong authoritarian rulers who governed independent territorial states.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_CnWeiWS] These territorial rulers commanded dependent officials, who were responsible for registering and mobilizing peasant households for military service.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_CnWeiWS][MAJIDBENAM_BR]It is difficult to find substantiated estimates for the population of the Wei state.</div></body></html>
