"The deterioration of Gandhara's economy after 230 CE is indicated by the fact that the last eight rulers of the Kushan Dynasty issued copper coins only."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_AfKushn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Many authors repeat that the peak was under Kanishka (they might be repeating each other without thinking) and this was true in territorial extent. However, considering the core region remained at peace a while thereafter, the economy strengthened and building construction increased a later date may actually be more appropriate.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Vima Kadphises (101-127 CE) "marks the period of increasing affluence (of which the gold coins were one manifestation)" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_AfKushn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Kanishka I (128-150 CE) was "immensely successful" in his military campaigns.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_AfKushn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Huvishka (155-190 CE): "The foundations of a prosperous Gandhara laid by Kanishka, especially through active participation in the Silk Route trade, continued to be strengthened during Huvishka's reign. This continuous prosperity is reflected in the large number of Buddhist monuments constructed in Huvishka's reign and the large number of gold and copper coins belonging to his period found from all regions of Gandhara."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_AfKushn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Vasudeva (190-220 CE): "the Buddhist establishment continued to prosper, and so did the economy. There was an accelleration of the activities of the Buddhist missionaries and a large number of Buddhist monks moved to Bactria and western China."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_AfKushn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Kanishka II (221-230 CE): "The Sassanians under Shahpur-I invaded Western Gandhara during the rule of Kanishka II and caused large-scale destruction to Buddhist monuments, and left the Kushans highly demoralized."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_AfKushn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Shortly before the Sasanid invasion of 230 CE "The Wei Lio (History of the Wei Dynasty) informs us that the Kingdom of Kabul (Kao-fu) and the Kingdom of India (T'ien-chou) were both dependencies of the Ta-Yueh-chih."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_AfKushn] These are either two parts of the Kushan state or two Kushan states.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_AfKushn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]2nd and 3rd CE in Bactria: art and architecture reach high stage of development.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_AfKushn]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 35-319 CE ♥</b>Sapadbizes (50-10 BCE) was the first Kushan clan chief. He was a ruler of western Bactria "sometimes linked to the Yuezhi. He is known only from his his coins" which are of "good silver" and "overstruck" those of Phraates IV of Parthia. Chinese chronicles suggest Sapadbizes was a Parthian vassal. It is assumed that his kingdom was conquered by Kujula Kadphises during the war with Parthia and became part of a Kushan Empire c30 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_AfKushn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Heralos or Heraus (10 BCE - 20 CE) claimed to be a Kushan ruler. He called himself a 'tyrant' on his coinage and had a deformed skull. "Although different views of chronology persist, there is no doubt that Heraus was an early ruler of the Kushan tribe of the Yuezhi confederacy in northern Bactria, more than a century after the nomads overthrew the Greco-Bactrian kingdom, shortly before the Kushan kings invaded India."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_AfKushn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Kujula Kadphises (20-65 CE) "was a Kushan prince who united the Yuezhi confederation during the 1st century CE, and became the first Kushan emperor. He was son of the Kushan ruler Keralos. He was the first ruler of the Kushan empire in Afghanistan. Later on he extended his rule to Gandhara and the Punjab (Pakistan) The rise of Kujula Kadphises is described in the Chinese historical chronicle, the Hou Hanshu".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_AfKushn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]From 35 CE an internal struggle took place between the five Yuezhi 'tribes' on the borders of the Chinese empire . Kadaphasa, head of the Kushan lineage 'tribe', emerges victorious. The Kushans solidified their control over Bactria, expand west into modern Afghanistan, and east into northwest Pakistan beginning in 45 CE. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_AfKushn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Vima Kadphises (75-105 CE) expanded the Kushan empire in India and acquired the port of Barygaza "where ships could sail to Egypt, bypassing Parthia" They traded with the Romans using this route c100 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_AfKushn] He introduced gold coinage to the existing silver and cooper coins.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_AfKushn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Vima Kadphises "changed the standard of the coins which had so far been of the same weight as the Indo-Greek ones been following Roman precedent."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_AfKushn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Kanishka I (105-140 CE) expanded the empire in Turkmenistan, Tajikstan, Kyrgstan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India. He moved the capital "from Bactra to Purushapura (Christian: 213)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_AfKushn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]End Date: {242-319 CE}. The first Sasanian sovereign Ardashir I raided the Kushana empire after conquering Armenia, which resulted in Kushan submission and the end of the independent Kushan empire. The Kushan king at the time succesfully intervened to support a pretender to the throne in 303 CE. The Sasanian King Shapur II regained the lost territories and once more subjugated the Kushans. The last Kushan king was Vasudeva II probably ruled as a vassal of the Sasanids for some time. The establishment of the Imperial Gupta dynasty by Candragupta in 319 CE is the absolute latest end date for the Kushans as a political entity.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_AfKushn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The end of the Kushans was a period of competing outsiders conquered them and placing them as vassals, with the Sassanians, Guptas and Hepthalites competing over the over-lordship.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ confederated state ♥</b>  Government infrastructure consisted of bureaucratic, military and feudatory elements headed by an absolute or near absolute military monarchy. The empire was expanded and its territorial integrity maintained by its army. One theory advocates that the political structure of the empire was characterized by a 'hierarchical organization in a feudatory system'. Another view suggests the Kushan concept of kingship represented 'a step in the growth of a centralized, imperial state'. Another hypothesis suggests the Kushan structure was a mixture of both bureaucratic and feudal elements.

They probably worshipped Ahuramazdah as ‘God of Heaven’ with solar features and Svanta Armati as ‘Goddess of Earth’. They were acquainted with several categories of divine beings such as daivas, yazatas and bagas; and used the verb yazas a term for sacrifice and worship, and the words baga-spasikaand bagana-patito denote different categories of priests. [...] When the Sakas and Kushans conquered the Graeco-Bactrian territories north of the Oxus, they found manifestations of Greek religious life, religious architecture, sculpture, ideas and worship. [...] Apparently the Kushan aristocracy tried to adopt the royal ideology of the Graeco-Bactrian kings and its religious implications. [...] The coinage of the next Kushan ruler, Kujula Kadphises, enables us to see how the religious horizon of the Kushans was enlarged. [...] Contrary to earlier assumptions, which regarded Kujula Kadphises as Buddhist on the basis of this epithet, it is now clear from the wording of a Mathura inscription, in which Huvishka bears the same epithet satyadharmasthita that the kingdom was conferred upon him by Sarva and Scamdavira (Candavıra), that is, he was a devotee of Siva. [...] At the time when Vima Kadphises became Kushan emperor, religious life can be characterized by two interesting features. One is the adoption of the forms of Greek religious art and the Greek iconographic interpretation of Kushan divinities. [...] The other striking feature is the strong orientation towards Indian religions and the worship of Siva in particular. It is, therefore, not surprising that the cult of Siva became even more prominent under Vima Kadphises, who conquered considerable territories in India. [...] While in the interest of his Indian conquest, Vima Kadphises had given preference to the worship of Siva in his religious policy, his successor Kanishka put Bactria and its Iranian religious cults at the centre of his religious policy. [...] None the less, the importance of India and the Indian religions, especially the worship ofSiva, remained unchanged. [...] Kanishka II clearly recognized the importance of Buddhism in his kingdom. [...] None the less, he did not neglect other religions and cults. On the reverse types of coins beside Boddo (Buddha) we find other Iranian divinities both Zoroastrian and local. [...] In spite of the scanty evidence, fragmentary in many respects, we can draw somegeneral conclusions about religious life throughout the territory of the Kushans. It was highly developed and differentiated. The religious movements of India Sivaism, Vishnuism, Jainism and Buddhism with their different schools penetrated Central Asia, as did Indian merchants when Kushan rule facilitated long-distance international trade. In eastern Iran the Indian religions met the Greek divinities, Zoroastrianism and many local pre-Zoroastrian forms of worship, and encountered the ancient Iranian religious ideas of the northern Iranian equestrian nomads. The Kushan kings selected for themselves from this immense variety those religious elements, ideas and forms of cults which fitted their ancient religious traditions and strengthened the religious ideology of their royal power. So the ‘Kushan pantheon’ appearing on the coins represents only a selection of the religious cults of their empire.//None the less, the Kushan kings were well aware of the current trends in religious life and followed them. The most important was syncretism. The great religions influenced one another and began slowly to absorb the local cults."
