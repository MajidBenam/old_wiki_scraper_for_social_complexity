The establishment of a confederation (although not yet a state) at the beginning of this period is suggested by the simultaneous abandonment of settlements and founding of Monte Albán, which itself was internally divided into different groupings of people (as shown by distinct pottery assemblages).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_MxAlb1E]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣  ♥</b> probably unknown. It has been suggested that Monte Alban became the new centre of a confederation of people from different settlements of the valley, but the exact relationship between Monte Alban and the remaining settlements of the valley is not known.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_MxAlb1E]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ MxRosar ♥</b> The largest centre before Monte Alban was San Jose Mogote, and it has been hypothesised that much of the population of Monte Alban came from San Jose Mogote and its surrounding settlements in the Etla subvalley.

The settlement at Monte Albán was founded at the beginning of this period and located in what was previously a 'buffer zone' between the three competing chiefdoms in the Valley of Oaxaca during the Rosario phase. It was built on a hill 400 metres above the valley floor,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_MxAlb1E] with limited access to farmland and water,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_MxAlb1E] which suggests other reasons for the founding of the settlement. One suggestion is that the location was intentionally chosen in the 'neutral' zone between the three competing chiefdoms as a political manoeuvre.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_MxAlb1E][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The establishment of a confederation (although not yet a state) at the beginning of this period is suggested by the simultaneous abandonment of settlements and founding of Monte Albán, which itself was internally divided into different groupings of people (as shown by distinct pottery assemblages).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_MxAlb1E][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Although there is evidence for the presence of inherited social status and mortuary and residential elaboration during this period, the method of political organization is still unclear.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_MxAlb1E] Archaeologist Arthur Joyce outlines possible power dynamics: 'The authority of the nobility may have been simultaneously couched in, but in dynamic tension with, traditional forms of authority that were more communal, egalitarian, and locally based.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_MxAlb1E][MAJIDBENAM_BR]There is a large range of population estimates for the valley during this period, from roughly 8000 to 15,000.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_MxAlb1E][MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_MxAlb1E] Monte Albán was the largest settlement in the Valley of Oaxaca during this period, although it was founded in a previously unoccupied location. The settlement began with around 2,000 people[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_MxAlb1E] and increased to over 5,000 towards the end of this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_MxAlb1E] Much of the population of the valley moved to the newly founded settlement, which left sites such as San José Mogote abandoned.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_MxAlb1E] Monte Albán became the largest settlement by far (324 ha in size towards the end of this period), but there were two other main settlements in the other arms of the valley (Yegüih and San Martin Tilcajete, the latter covering 52.8 ha by the end of the period).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_MxAlb1E]</div></body></html>
