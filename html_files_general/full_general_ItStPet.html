In the early eighth century Charlemagne (reign 800-814 CE) added three cities to the holdings of the Papal State (Imola, Bologna, Ferrara; the details of which are given in the <i>Vita Hadriani</i> of the <i>Liber Pontificalis</i>).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_ItStPet] However, the late eighth and early ninth centuries was the highpoint politically and in terms of construction and the economy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_ItStPet] The papacy lost power and prestige during the ninth century, despite its gradual emancipation from Carolingian domination as the Frankish empire began to break up.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_ItStPet] Between the end of the ninth century and the 960s, the papacy had no powerful protectors outside Italy.

After this time, the years of the Byzantine Emperor's reign were no longer used for dating Papal documents or on the minting of imperial coins in the mint of Rome.

The Pope was elected by citizens and the army - usually based on the choice of the clergy. Representatives would the certify the choice to the Exarch in Ravenna for imperial approval. The Exarch could make the choice himself in case of disagreement. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_ItStPet][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In 781 CE Charlemagne asserted Frankish suzerainty over the region. After this time, the years of the Byzantine Emperor's reign were no longer used for dating Papal documents or on the minting of imperial coins in the mint of Rome.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_ItStPet] During the ninth century the Papacy was released from Carolingian influence as the Frankish empire began to break up.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_ItStPet][MAJIDBENAM_BR]This also meant that between the end of the ninth century and the 960s, the papacy had no powerful protectors outside Italy.
