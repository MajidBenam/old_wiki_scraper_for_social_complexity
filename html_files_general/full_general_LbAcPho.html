It is thought by some[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_LbAcPho] that Carthage and other Mediterranean colonies were able to split away from Tyrian control at this point, though they still paid regular tribute per their treaty obligations. Though Phoenicia as a whole remained prosperous, especially during the Persian era, the power and influence of Levantine Phoenicia over their colonies seems to have declined.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 1200-332 BCE ♥</b> The beginning date is approximate, during the time when the earlier Canaanite culture entered its final decline, the Egyptian and Hittite empires both suddenly lost much of their power, and the Phoenician culture differentiated itself. The end date reflects the conquest of Tyre by Alexander the Great. (Arguments could be made for earlier dates as well; in approximately 850 BCE, the Assyrian king Ashurnasirpal II conquered the Phoenician cities and turned them into vassals.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_LbAcPho] This was not the first time that the Assyrians had conquered Phoenicia—Tiglath-Pileser I campaigned against them c. 1100 BCE[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_LbAcPho]—but in the earlier instance, Assyrian control was short-lived and ended around 1050 BCE, and the Phoenicians regained their independence. After the conquest by Ashurnasirpal II, the Phoenician cities in the Levantine coast spent most of their cultural existence as vassals of one empire or another. However, the Assyrians and later the Persians gave the Phoenician cities a wide degree of autonomy because of their seafaring skill; they were more useful as autonomous traders who could then be a rich source of tribute.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_LbAcPho])</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ quasi-polity ♥</b> "In 1983, Röllig criticized the “rather imprecise concept of the Phoenicians” employed by most scholars, but argued that “this need not surprise us unduly since the nation itself never developed an idea of ‘Phoenician’ as a national concept.” Most of our inscriptional evidence indicates that the populations others referred to as “Phoenicians” self-identified in terms of city-based affiliations or family ties during the Iron II-III periods; the tendency in presentations of Phoenician history from the past twenty-five years has been to emphasize these city-based allegiances, or to describe them politically in terms of a working confederacy."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_LbAcPho]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none: 1200-1101 BCE; vassalage: 1100-1050 BCE; none: 1049-850 BCE; vassalage: 849-332 BCE♥</b> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_LbAcPho] Though the Israelite king Ahab is recorded to have married a Phoenician princess (sometime around 800-850 BCE), this does not appear to have led to a political union.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Canaan ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b> "…it was at the end of the Late Bronze Age (ca. 1200 BCE) that certain city states or regional polities appeared thereafter to be differentiated from the relatively homogenous Canaanite material culture of the Levant that preceded it. In other words, the early Iron I period did not witness a sudden “appearance” of something others would come to call Phoenicia or Phoenician city-states; instead the transition was one of a general disruption of other sites and regional cultures in the Levant."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_LbAcPho]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Macedonian Empire ♥</b> Alexander the Great destroyed much of the city of Tyre in 332 BCE, and killed or enslaved the bulk of the population. This episode essentially broke the power of the Phoenician cities in the Levant, leaving Carthage and other colonies to the West as the remaining bearers of Phoenician culture. (Tyre and Sidon were able to briefly win independence from the Seleucid Empire some centuries later, before being conquered again and ultimately incorporated into the Roman Empire.)</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ Phoenician ♥</b> Also called Punic/Phoenician, it encompassed independent colonies across the Mediterranean—the most famous of which was the city of Carthage.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣ [8,000-10,000]: 1200-801 BCE; [20,000-40,000]: 800-332 BCE ♥</b>km squared.

"By the end of the 11th century B.C., two new factors assumed primary importance in early Phoenician history. Tyre became the leading maritime center, having eclipsed its mother city Sidon…"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_LbAcPho] The two cities were often joined in a personal union, and the king of Tyre would often be referred to by outside authors as "king of the Sidonians." However, "it is Sidon… which emerges clearly as the pre-eminent Phoenician state by the early fifth century, a role which it occupied until the closing years of the Persian era."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_LbAcPho] Sidon was brutally conquered by Artaxerxes III of Persia c. 342 BCE.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Phoenician ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Semitic ♥</b>Map on left taken from the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://chronicle.fanack.com/lebanon/history-past-to-present/from-phoenicians-to-french-mandate/">Fanack Chronicle</a>.

It is difficult to assign exact dates to this quasi-polity,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_LbAcPho] but here we focus on the period between c. 1200 BCE and 332 BCE, when the Phoenician city of Tyre fell to Alexander the Great.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_LbAcPho] The Phoenicians were skilled traders and seafarers.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_LbAcPho][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The ruler of a Phoenician city was somewhere between human and divine. He was not a god, but was the highest priest with a privileged relationship to the city's patron deity.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_LbAcPho] However, his power was not unlimited: merchant families also wielded considerable influence in public affairs and, at least in Byblos, Sidon, and possibly Tyre, the king was assisted by a council of elders. In Tyre, between 605 and 561 BCE, the monarchy was replaced with a republic, in which the government was led by a series of judges known as <i>suffetes</i>, who ruled for only short terms.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_LbAcPho][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Reliable population figures for the Phoenician cities are lacking.</div></body></html>
