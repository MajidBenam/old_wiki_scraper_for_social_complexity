Although some component peoples of the Hepthalites may have survived into the period of the Islamic conquest, even this contingent had faded outside of some mountain strongholds by around 670 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_AfHepht][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"565 Almost complete disappearance of Hephthalites in the face of the emergence of the western Turks (Gokturks)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_AfHepht][MAJIDBENAM_BR]570 CE is when the core territories were split between the Turkic nomads in the north, and the resurgent Sassanian empire.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The timeline of  Hepathalites arrival into India is murky but indicates a period of dominance until the local population rebelled after religious persecution and a reduction in military support when the Hepthalites faced conflicts with incoming Turkic peoples. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_AfHepht]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ nominal; confederated state ♥</b>The Hepthalites were one group of a series of nomadic tribal confederations that are sometimes referred to as the White Huns. The evidence seems to indicate that they were a second wave of Hunnish migration. Commentators at the time differ as to what the structure of the group was and to what degree they differed from the other nomadic peoples of the area. The Byzantian commentator  Procopius of Caesarea stressed that, 'They are not nomadic like the other Hunnish peoples, but have long since settled on fertile land.' He further explained that unlike the other peoples of central asia, the Hepthalites were, 'ruled by one king and possess a legal state structure, observing justice among themselves and with their neighbours in no lesser measure than the Byzantines and Persians.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_AfHepht][MAJIDBENAM_BR]As a nomadic confederation, there does not seem to have been a centralized power structure, although some evidence indicates the adoption of local administrations for the purposes of exacting tribute. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_AfHepht] During the peak of their power, they seem to have become increasingly sedentary, and this potentially increased the degree of centralization.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ alliance; vassalage ♥</b>Sassanid tribute[MAJIDBENAM_BR] "459 Hephthalites assist Firuz (Peroz) to regain his Sassanid throne; he must pay significant tribute in return."

Independent elements in the south maintained a degree of independence in the Zerafshan valley as tribute payers to the Turks, and further south to the Sasasians. By the 570s the only truly independent fragments of the former power of the Hepthalites were located in modern day Tajikistan and Afghanistan, the longest enduring in Kabul.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_AfHepht]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Sassanid Empire I ♥</b> the core area of this polity is considered to be Sogdiana</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ elite migration ♥</b> "The original homeland of the Hephthalites is relatively obscure although most experts agree that they originated north of the Great Wall of China, in or near present day Mongolia.

However, there is no consensus among scholars.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_AfHepht] Recent work has reappraised Chinese manuscript sources to postulate that the Hephtalites had ceased to retain their original Altaic language and adopted Bactrian by the end of the fourth century.

Sung Yun reports that in Tokharistan ‘the majority of them do not believe in Buddhism. Most of them worship wai-shen or “foreign gods”.’ He makes almost identical remarks about the Hephthalites of Gandhara, saying that they honour kui-shen (demons). The manuscripts of the Liang shu (Book 54) contain important evidence: ‘[the Hephthalites] worship T’ien- shen or [the] heaven god and Huo-shen or [the] fire god. Every morning they first go outside [of their tents] and pray to [the] gods and then take breakfast.’ For the Chinese observer, the heaven god and the fire god were evidently foreign gods. We have no evidence of the specific content of these religious beliefs but it is quite possible that they belonged to the Iranian (or Indo-Iranian) group."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_AfHepht]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Genus ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion ♣ ♥</b>Hepthalite Empire 500 CE [MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_AfHepht][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Hepthalites were one group of a series of nomadic tribal confederations that are sometimes referred to as the White Huns. The evidence seems to indicate that they were a second wave of Hunnish migration.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_AfHepht] Despite the name, some scholars think the White Huns were in fact not a Turkic people, but rather the easternmost group of Iranian nomads.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_AfHepht][MAJIDBENAM_BR]At their peak territorial coverage the Hephthalite lands may have enclosed 26 million people but most subjects likely had a great deal of autonomy. As a nomadic confederation, the Hepthalites may not have possessed a central administration, although evidence indicates at least the adoption of local administrations for the purposes of exacting tribute.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_AfHepht] During the peak of their power, they seem to have become increasingly sedentary, and this may have increased the degree of centralization. Coins show Hephthalites practiced skull deformation[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_AfHepht] which may provide indirect evidence for strong social hierarchy and status competition.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Commentators at the time differed in their opinions as to what the structure of the group was and to what degree they differed from the other nomadic peoples of the area.
