And they were non-coercive settlements. Groups congregated by choice. This is an instance of transformation from a rural to an urban society that did not establish a hierarchical society and coercive centralized control... The process in the delta and at Jenne-jeno in particular, was one of 'complexification' rather than centralization."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_MlJeJe2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ ♥</b> unknown</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Jenne-jeno I ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuation  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Jenne-jeno III ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ Sahel Tell Culture ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣ [1,500,000-2,500,000] ♥</b> km squared. "Permanent settlement in the delta, resulting in the formation of tells (large mounds consisting of the accumulated remains of ancient settlements), was initiated by people who entered the region during the last 500 years BC. They made pottery similar to that found at earlier sites along the southern fringe of the Sahara, suggesting that the immigrants were part of a southward movement of herders, fishermen, and cultivators that began with the accelerating desiccation of the Sahara and Sahel regions around 2000 BC."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_MlJeJe2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣  ♥</b>(Pl. 4) [MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_MlJeJe2][MAJIDBENAM_BR](Pl. 7) [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_MlJeJe2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The archaeological site of Jenne-jeno (or Djenné-djenno) is a mound located in the Niger Inland Delta, a region of West Africa just south of the Sahara and part of modern-day Mali, characterized by lakes and floodplains. It was continuously inhabited between 250 BCE and 1400 CE. 'Jenne-jeno II' refers to the period from 50 to 400 CE. During this time, the site's inhabitants fished, gathered wild plants, hunted, and cultivated rice (as well as millet and sorghum). They also made and used pottery, and smelted, smithed and used iron, though they probably imported the raw material for the latter from far afield.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_MlJeJe2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]It appears that the heterarchical organization that characterized Jenne-jeno in later times developed during this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_MlJeJe2] As for population, it is unclear how many people were living at Jenne-jeno or at the surrounding sites at this time, but a relatively rapid demographic increase is also likely.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_MlJeJe2]</div></body></html>
