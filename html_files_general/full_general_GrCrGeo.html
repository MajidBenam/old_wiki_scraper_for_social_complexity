The period starts with the arrival of Dorians and ends with the emergence of Cretan city-states.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ quasi-polity♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣none♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Mycenaean Crete♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ disruption/continuity♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Archaic Crete♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ Early Iron Age Greece/Geometric Greece♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣none♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣Doric Greek; Eteocretan♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b> The linguistic family of Eteocretan is unknown. [Indo-European]: for Doric Greek[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The eleventh century BCE marks the beginning of radical changes in southern Greece generally as well as Crete specifically, largely resulting from the invasion from the North of the Dorians[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_GrCrGeo] Overall, however, this period is relatively poorly understood, with no written sources and few archaeological finds. Most likely, Cretans mainly dedicated themselves to farming and pastoralism. Writing disappeared and artistic expression became more abstracted and geometrical. Things started to change in the eighth century, when trade routes were revitalized, and Cretans were able to capitalize on the island's premier location in the Eastern Mediterranean. And the trade in artefacts and products was accompanied by the exchange of new ideas and technologies. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_GrCrGeo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Not much is known about either the island's population numbers at the time, or its political organization. In terms of population, very few settlements have been excavated, and none of these have yielded enough data for a credible estimate; in terms of political organization, it is likely that elite families were in charge but not much else could be said.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_GrCrGeo]</div></body></html>
