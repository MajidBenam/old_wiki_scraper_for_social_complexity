The total land area of Yemen is 527,970 km2 including the islands of Perim and Socotra. The population was estimated at 19.2 M in 2003 (World Bank 2004). The highest elevation is 3760 m above sea level at Jabal-an-Nabi Shu’ayb. Most of the land is desert, with a hot and humid climate along the west coast, extraordinarily hot, dry and harsh desert in the eastern part, and a temperate climate with seasonal monsoons in the western hilly area.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_YeQasmi] 'Yemen occupies the southern shore and the southwestern corner of the Arabian peninsula. Its western boundary is the Red Sea. The country has a mountainous interior with a temperate or subtropical climate. The central highlands divide Yemen into a coastal plain called the Tihama, which has a tropical climate with sparse rainfall, and a desert region that stretches into the Empty Quarter. A midlands area consists of valleys (wadis) and foothills that slope down to the lowlands. Southwest monsoons influence Yemen's climate. THe southern highlands receive the most rainfall, particularly where mountains provide less of a barrier to precipitation.'

Muhammad claimed the Imamate in 1597 and fought the Turks for slightly more than two decades.' When he died in 1620, his son al-Mu'ayyad Muhammad took the Imamate and renewed the war, but it was not until 1636 that the Turks were all driven out and the Zaydis came to hold all Yemen.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_YeQasmi]  Parts of Yemen were re-taken by the Ottoman empire in the 19th century: 'By the 16th century and again in the 19th century, North Yemen became part of Ottoman Empire, from which it gained independence in 1918.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_YeQasmi] </div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ loose ♥</b> Tribal leaders held lands, collected taxes, and defended forts, enabling them to form a power base in their own right: 'Whatever setbacks they suffered, however, Bayt al-Ahmar were not displaced permanently. In the year after Abu 'Alamah's rising, when the Sharif of Abu 'Arish and a rival claimant to the Imamate were active in the north-west, they were again a power to be reckoned with." Certainly they collected taxes as well as rents in the nineteenth century, and local memory credits them with taking revenue even from coastal towns in the north Tihamah, They retain considerable lands in the west to the present day.'

Yemeni values have traditionally relied on a hierarchical, tribally organized, and sex-segregated society. In 1962, following the overthrow of a conservative monarchy that had been supported by members of the Zaydi Islamic sect, the Republic was established, marking Yemen's entry into the modern world.'

Al-Qasim himself, who early in his fight against the Turks had wept over his children starving at Barat, was wealthy when the truce was signed. He built the mosque at Shaharah, then built houses for himself and his followers, planted coffee in al-Ahnum, and amassed more land than the public treasury (Nubdhah: 258, 334-6). The court expanded with the southern conquests. Al-Mutawakkil received an embassy from Ethiopia and exchanged gifts of fine horses with Aurangzib of India (Serjeant 1983: 80-1), while his relatives expressed concern about his monthly demands for funds from Lower Yemen. Further criticism of his taxation policy came from Muhammad al-Ghurbani at Barat, but in 1675 the levies on Lower Yemen were redoubled (ibid. 82). Under Muhammad Ahmad, 'He of al-Mawahib'" (1687-1718), the exactions became more severe still, in support of a grandiose court and a large standing army complete with slave soldiers (ibid., Zabarah 1958: 451, 457; alShawkani 1929: ii. 98).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_YeQasmi] Dresch implies that the imamic capital was moved at least once: 'At times of truce, al-Qasim had acted against some of the tribes' own practices: for example, he put a stop to pilgrimages and sacrifices at a tree near Wadi Mawr and flogged men from alAhnurn for drinking (ibid. 338); his appointee even wheedled out of the tribes their 'books of tiighiit' and duly burned them (ibid. 435). Under al-Qasirn's successors, however, the tribes were treated carefully. Al-Mu'ayyad (1620-44), for example, seems not to have pressed the point of Islamic inheritance law and to have left the taxation of Barat in the hands of Bayt al-'Ansi, while his successor, al-Mutawakkil (1644-76), paid the tribes of Barat to support his campaign against Hadramawt (Serjeant 1983: 79-82). Aden and Lahj, which had already seceded, were retaken; a decade later alBaYQa' and Yafi' were subdued; Hadramawt was invaded; and the Zaydi arms were carried at one point to the borders of Dhufar in what is now Oman. The Qasimis also became involved in, though they did not conquer, areas north of Najran and 'Asir: 'the conquests spread with the support of the Hamdan tribes and the leadership of the Qasimi family' (al-Sharnahi 1972: 145), and alMutawakkil moved his capital from Shaharah to Dawran, south of San'a'. The state (now called a dawlah by its own chroniclers) had to link the north, where armed force still lay, to the richer tax base of Lower Yemen.'

Regional variations in the pronunciation of certain Arabic phonemes (especially the phoneme /q/) differentiates the speech of northerners from southerners, for example.

The Ottoman Empire gained control of the region in the first half of the 16th century CE before being overthrown by the Qasimi dynasty.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_YeQasmi] The Qasimi dynasty ruled until the 19th century, when Yemen was divided up between the Ottomans in the north and the British in the south.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_YeQasmi] North Yemen became independent in 1918, while South Yemen did not gain its independence until decades later in 1967. The two countries were united in 1990.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_YeQasmi][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]During the Qasimi period, Qasimid imams and their retainers and courtiers co-existed and occasionally competed with tribal shaykhs and their followers.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_YeQasmi] Tribal leaders retained significant power, although the imams still collected taxes.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_YeQasmi] Tribal authority remained important even under British and Ottoman rule. Some Yemeni leaders sided with the colonial powers, while others continued to resist.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_YeQasmi] Nor did the new government supplant autonomous tribal power after independence: the tribes were stronger than the new imamate, although they remained fragmented.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_YeQasmi] After 1962, when the imamate was overthrown, the new government created a more structured bureaucracy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_YeQasmi][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Secure population estimates for the Qasimi or colonial period in Yemen are lacking. In 1990, the population of Yemen was estimated at between 10 and 11 million.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_YeQasmi]</div></body></html>
