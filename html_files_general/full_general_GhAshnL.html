[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_GhAshnL] 'Looking back they recall how, until the last quarter of the nineteenth century, they controlled an ever-increasing area which at its peak stretched over 550 km into the interior and encompassed many distinctive groups and regions. Asante armies were powerful and well-organised, equipped with imported firearms scarcely available to poorer and more isolated northern groups.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_GhAshnL] Within this general trend of military conquest and domination, the peak period was likely the early 19th century, characterized by military successes against the British: 'One major reason for this increase in British influence came as a result of Asante expansion toward the coast. For the Asante this was vitally necessary to ensure a ready supply of European firearms to maintain their hold over their outlying provinces. [...] In 1806 the Asante, under their dynamic leader, Asantehene Osei Bonsu, defeated the Fante and besieged the British fort at Anomabu. In 1811, 1814, and 1816 the Asante again invaded the Fante area and finally established domination over the coast. [...] A dispute over jurisdiction eventually led to war, but Macarthy's forces proved no match for the Asantes. In 1824, at the battle of Nsamankow, they were ambushed and the governor and seven of his officers were killed. At this point the Asante empire was at the height of its power.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_GhAshnL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 1701-1895 CE ♥</b> This period begins in 1701 CE when 'the Asantemanso under the leadership of Osei Tutu (d. 1717) rebelled and defeated the Denkyira'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_GhAshnL]. This period ends in 1895 CE, 'the last year in which the Union was intact before defeat by the British, exile of the King, and conquest.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_GhAshnL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ confederated state ♥</b> The Union founded after Osei Tutu's military victory against the Denkyira incorporated a set of allied sub-polities under the overall authority of the Asantehene based at Kumasi: 'In the aftermath of the Denkyira war the military coalition of states was transformed into a political union.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_GhAshnL] For Hayford, this union was essentially a confederation of several 'imperia in imperio' under the paramount authority of the Asantehene: 'The Native State, in its highest development, is to be found where a number of considerably important communities combine and own allegiance to one central paramount Authority. Such Authority is the King, properly so called. Thus in Ashanti, before the breaking up of the Court at Kumasi, there were the Manpons, the Juabins, the Kokofus, the Beckwas, the Adansis, and several other large and important communities, owning allegiance to the stool of Kumasi as the paramount stool of all Ashanti. Each of these important communities, when regarded with respect to the entire State, was a sort of imperium in imperio-in fact, several distinct native states federated together under the same laws, the same customs, the same faith and worship, the people speaking the same language, and all owning allegiance to a paramount king or president, who represented the sovereignty of the entire Union.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_GhAshnL] For Arhin, the 'official', confederated character of the Ashanti Union was being increasingly eroded during the time period in question, with the Asantehene seeking to concentrate power in Kumasi: 'Formally the Asante lived within a system of decentralized ‘patrimonialism’: that is to say, under the authority of hereditary rulers selected by the heads of the constituent units of the  oman, the localized matrilineages, the villages and the districts who were, in the main, a gerontocratic body. The members of the various units also enjoyed rights of use in land. But the political history of Asante, from the beginning of the eighteenth century to the eve of colonial rule, was the history of the erosion of these political and economic rights. It was a history of the increasing personalization of power at the expense of the holders of hereditary authority and also of commoners.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_GhAshnL] British colonial incursions subsequently upset the indigenous power structure and weakened Kumasi by imposing their own administration on the native system, including a court of 'appeals in the hands of a British administrative officer' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_GhAshnL], and by backing indigenous resistance against the King. Wilks describes a dynamic struggle between competing interests:  'The Kumaseman sought to build up its power to ensure not only its de jure but also its de facto preeminence within the Asanteman. It moved slowly but surely towards a form of absolutism. The  aman resisted the engrossment of power by Kumase and strove to maintain a “parcellization” of sovereignty of the sort also characteristic of feudalism.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_GhAshnL] This supports the characterization of Asanteman as a confederated state despite of this process of centralization: 'It is arguable that the union, the Asanteman, has survived precisely because different (and even conflicting) concepts of its nature have always been possible. Did member states, for example, have a right to secede, or was the union indissoluble? In the early nineteenth century the Dwabenhene clearly believed that he did have the right, the Asantehene that he did not.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_GhAshnL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥</b> 'Although ethnically and culturally closely related, the Akan have never had a common polity, and they may be roughly divided into the Brong, Akyem, Akuapim, Kwawu, Assen-Twifo, Wasa, Fante-Agona, Nzima-Evalue, Ahanta and Ashanti, each group speaking a distinct dialect.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_GhAshnL] 'Greater Asante' was a conglomerate made up of sub-polities paying allegiance to Kumasi and tributary states: 'First, there was the Kumasi state, administered like any other Asante state by the Asantehene and his council members. Second, Kumasi, together with the neighbouring Asante-Twi-speaking states, formed the Asante Union, with a council consisting of the Asantehene, some members of the Kumasi state council, and the heads of the other Asante states. Third, there were the “provinces,” consisting of the other Twi-speaking peoples north and south of Asante. Fourth, there were the non-Twi-speaking protectorate and tributary states southeast and north of the Twi-speaking peoples.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_GhAshnL] This structure did not depend on alliances with external forces.

Drawn by the trading activity on the coast, descendants of the defunct Bonda and Kumbu kingdoms settled along the north-south trade routes connecting the coast to the Niger bend region. The Queen mother of the Bonda founded the Akyerekyere kingdom along one trade route, which became a clearinghouse for goods from the coast. A prince of the former Kumbu royal house founded the Akumu-Akoto kingdom on another trade route. The Portuguese referred to this latter kingdom as the 'Acanes,' hence the name Akan. Emigrants from Akumu-Akoto founded a second city-state to the east, called Akwamu. Emigrants from Akwamu in turn founded the Asantemanso kingdom in the Kumasi region. Mande-speaking immigrants conquered the Akyerekyere kingdom and later the Asantemanso kingdom to become the dominant power in the region, the Denkyira. In 1701, the Asantemanso under the leadership of Osei Tutu (d. 1717) rebelled and defeated the Denkyira.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_GhAshnL] 'He became the overall King (or Asantehene) of a group of allied towns or states centred around Kumase. According to Asante traditions he followed earlier rulers, the almost mythical twins Twum and Antwi, then Oti Akenten and Obiri Yeboa, his predecessor, slain in war. Traditions indicate that the kingdom's founders spread out from an early settlement in Adanse to settle at Kumase, near the earlier trading town of Tafo. They conquered groups already settled in the area and were joined by other bands of immigrants from earlier states to the south, attracted by the opportunities the new area offered. The new kingdom included the towns of Bekwae, Kokofu, Mampon, Nsuta, Dwaben and Edweso and was apparently organised on principles evolved in earlier, more southerly kingdoms like Denkyira and Akwamu. The founding  [...] states each had its ‘paramount chief’ or  Omanhene.'

Obiri Yeboah died in war with the Dorma people, then located within four miles of Kumasi, and was succeeded by Osei Tutu (died 1717). Osei Tutu defeated the Dorma (Reindorf, 1895: 50; Fuller, 1968: 2) and led the Asante to conquer Denkyira (Bosman, 1705), their south-western neighbour and erstwhile overlords, in 1699-1708  [...] Between Osei Tutu and Osei Bonsu (1800-1824) the Asante conquered or otherwise brought into subjection to the Asantehene (King of Asante), nearly all the peoples now inhabiting all the regions of modern Ghana and also east-central and south-western Ivory Coast (Rattray, 1923: 287-293; Priestley and Wilks, 1960; Fynn, 1971: 105, 155; Meredith, 1812; Wilks, 1975; 43-79).'

When they did not recognize Ashanti sovereignty in the area, the Ashanti invaded. In 1874, British forces launched a counteroffensive and sacked Kumasi. In 1883 a general uprising led to the overthrow of the Ashanti chi ef Mensu Bonsu and four years of civil war (1884-1888). A faction representing mercantile interests prevailed, although an Imperial faction regained power in the following decade. This led to another war with the British, who again attacked Kumasi in 1895 and captured the Ashanti king and chiefs. The king and chiefs were exiled and in 1901 the whole region was declared a British possession.'

To the south are groups like the Fante, Akwamu and Akyem, speaking virtually identical tonal languages (sometimes called Twi, or Akan) of the Kwa family and with whom the Asante share many elements of culture. Among these groups, for example, there are traces of the great matrilineal clans [...] formerly recognised in Asante, the practice of naming children according to the day of birth (for example, Kofi, a Friday-born male; Abena, a Tuesday-born girl), and many closely similar religious ideas and rituals. Some of these groups also retain traditions of a move to the south from the open areas north of the forest.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_GhAshnL] Sarbah agrees with this view: 'The common origin of the inhabitants of the Fanti districts, Asanti, and wherever the Akan language is spoken, has been already shown. The Customary Laws of the inhabitants of these places are in the main identical, and the national constitutions resemble each other in many points, although Asanti military organization had been developed in a greater degree.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_GhAshnL] Hayford comments on cultural and linguistic similiarities between the Ashanti and Fante peoples: 'They speak the same language with only a difference of accent, such difference being a refinement upon whichever form of speech was the original type. It is probable the Ashanti type is the original, since it is reasonable to suppose that the coast tribes were detached from the Ashantis, and not  vice versa. There is no tradition showing that the Fantis were ever a distinct and separate people from the Ashantis. On the other hand, there is historical evidence that, at the dawn of European intercourse with the Gold Coast, the Ashanti Union fully recognised the existence and independence of the Fanti Union; and the current of immigration southwards from the north of tribes now dwelling between Ashanti proper and Fanti proper, all of whom have in common the same language with the Ashantis and Fantis, lends weight to this striking fact.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_GhAshnL] The scale of supracultural interaction was amplified with the intensification of colonial penetration: 'But in the mid-nineteenth century, and for the economic and political reasons outlined above, Asante society became much less confined, and much more permeable and accessible. I think that it would be missing the point to see this matter in the short term, and to interpret it from the viewpoint of - for example - formal conversion to Christianity or numbers of political or economic refugees. What, I think, is of paramount importance is that it was in this period that Asante became massively exposed to novel options, to different (and even contradictory) ways of looking at the world. These influences would take a long time to germinate and to bear fruit, but in retrospect we can see that this period represented a watershed in the understanding of values and beliefs. In cognitive terms - and we can see this prosopographically - the ‘generation’ of 1880 was further removed from that of 1830 than that ‘generation’ had been from any of its predecessors throughout Asante history (Wilks and McCaskie, 1973-79).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_GhAshnL] The Columbian Exchange and contact with European traders, missionaries, and colonizers had lasting effects on culture change in Southern Ghana and were probably more important than Asanteman's interactions with fellow Akan peoples.

In the 19th century, the culture of Kumasi, with its heterogeneous population including peoples drawn from all over the territories under the Asantehene, Muslims from as far afield as the Maghreb and Mecca, and European visitors from the coast, took a shape distinct from that of the surrounding villages (Bowdich 1819, Freeman 1967 [1898]). Kumasi dwellers believed themselves, and were believed to be, more refined than villagers, and the term  kuraseni became one of insult, meaning a “rude” person. The word  Kumasisem, meaning “the Kumasi way of life,” was in turn applied to the new settler in Kumasi who outdid the old-timers in exhibiting the Kumasi life-style.'

This region has seen the emergence of various autonomous states, including Bono, Djomo, Akwamu, Fante, and Asante. Later in its history, the founders of the Ga and Ewe states arrived from what is now Nigeria.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_GhAshnL] In 1471, Portuguese sailors reached this stretch of coast and quickly established trade with the coastal Akan states, exchanging European goods for gold.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_GhAshnL] Trade routes soon connected the coast to the Niger bend region, along which descendants of the former Bonda and Kumbu kingdoms founded the Akyerekyere and Akumu-Akoto kingdoms respectively. The Portuguese referred to this latter kingdom as the 'Acanes', which is the source of the name Akan.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_GhAshnL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In 1701, the Asante rebelled against the dominant Denkyira state and formed a confederacy of Akan states who accepted Asante rule. This confederacy began to conquer the surrounding polities, and by 1764 the Greater Asante controlled an area nearly the size of present-day Ghana.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_GhAshnL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Europeans continued to be drawn to the Ghanaian coast in search of gold and, by the 19th century, the British were the strongest European power in the region. In 1827, British-led troops defeated an Asante army at Katammanso.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_42_GhAshnL] In 1831, the British and Asante signed a peace treaty that allowed trade in all ports, and by 1844 the British gained control over criminal matters in the areas around trade forts. By 1872, the British had complete control of the coast, and when they did not recognize Asante sovereignty, the Asante attacked. The British were victorious, and after another war in 1895, the Asante king and chiefs were exiled. The entire region was declared a British territory in 1901.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_43_GhAshnL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]During the pre-Asante period, each Akan state consisted of a single kingdom ruled by an <i>omanhene</i>, which literally translates to 'state-chief'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_44_GhAshnL] This king came from a royal clan, and was elected by various officials, most notably the <i>ohemmaa</i> ('queen-mother'), who was a senior woman of the clan. The king was a sacred person who could not be observed eating or drinking; nor could he be heard to speak or be spoken to.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_45_GhAshnL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]After 1701, political organization within the region became far more bureaucratic and specialized. Kumasi became the capital of the union of Asante states and the seat of the empire. Appointed officials began to replace those wielding hereditary authority, and a treasury partly operated by literate Muslims was created.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_46_GhAshnL] However, while bureaucrats ran many of the day-to-day operations of the empire, the authority of the king was still absolute.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_47_GhAshnL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Population estimates are not available for the pre-Asante period.
