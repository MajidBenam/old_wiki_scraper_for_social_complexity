In fact, the seat of the political centre shifted from Miwa, during the Early Kofun, to Kawachi, in the Middle Kofun, and finally to Asuka in the Late Kofun period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_JpKofun][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Early Kofun period is characterized by the spatial distribution of many contemporaneous large keyhole shaped tumuli, which represent the presence of several different polities and regional leaders.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_JpKofun][MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_JpKofun] In this period, bronze mirrors, beads of jasper and green tuff, <i>haniwa</i> vessels, iron weapons and tools were deposited in the large mounded tombs, which likely hosted the burial of a regional chief.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_JpKofun] The burial chambers were either cists made of slate stone in oblong plan or vertical pitsdug on the top of the mound.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_JpKofun] The political centre was Miwa, in the south-eastern Nara basin. Thi centres incorporated the Makimuku district, which housed the large Hashikaka keyhole-shaped tomb (280 m long), considered to be the burial place of the queen Himiko.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_JpKofun] The power was held at Miwa by the Sujin dynasty.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_JpKofun][MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_JpKofun][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Middle Kofun period is characterized by the spread of large keyhole-shaped mounds in the Osaka Plains.The grave assemblage met substantial change: bronze mirrors and fine beadstone objects were no longer deposited.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_JpKofun][MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_JpKofun] Instead, the amount of iron deposited in the tombs in form of weapons and/or tools increased.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_JpKofun] Beads, armlets and talismans begant to be made of talc, and they were not only deposited in burials but also used in landscape rituals.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_JpKofun][MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_JpKofun][MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_JpKofun] Horse trappings, gilt-bronze ornaments and gold jewellery began being deposited in the grave assemblage of large burial mounds.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_JpKofun] In this period, the power was exerted by the Ojin dynasty in the centre of Kawachi, in the east central Osaka prefecture.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_JpKofun][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the Late Kofun Period the size of the burial mounds decreased significantly and the construction of large keyhole-shaped tumuli ceased, except for the Kanto region. Thereafter, the tumuli of the regional leaders were downsized and built in a rectangular and square shape.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_JpKofun][MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_JpKofun][MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_JpKofun] This decline was followed by the proliferation of clusters of small round tumuli called "packed tumuli clusters".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_JpKofun] They have been interpreted as the result of the emulation of the chiefly habits by powerful extended family-scale groupings.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_JpKofun] In this period were also introduced the corridor-chamber tombs and the cliff-cut cave tombs.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_JpKofun] The power was held by the Keitai dinasty in the centre of Asuka, in southern Nara prefecture.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_JpKofun] The introduction of Buddhism in 552 CE, determined a new Buddhism-based culture in the area.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_JpKofun][MAJIDBENAM_BR]We have estimated the population of Kansai to be between 150,000 and 200,000 people in 300 CE, and between 1.5 million and 2 million by 500 CE. An estimated 16.8% of the Japanese population lived in Kansai from 250-599 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_42_JpKofun] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_43_JpKofun]</div></body></html>
