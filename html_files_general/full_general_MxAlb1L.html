Neither conquered the other (based on distinct material culture and architectural styles) but did trade with one another.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_MxAlb1L] Monte Alban Late I: “The expansionist tactics adopted by the rulers of Monte Albán apparently took many forms—including not just conquest, but also colonization, episodic raiding, the establishment of marriage alliances and/or trading relationships (perhaps backed by threats or occasional military force), and co-option of existing political structures.”[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_MxAlb1L]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ MxAlb1E ♥</b> </div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b> The Zapotec polity continued to be centred at Monte Albán, but began to extend its territory at the beginning of this phase.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_MxAlb1L][MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_MxAlb1L]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ MxAlb2* ♥</b>  </div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b> Distinctive pottery styles suggest that there were around 745 communities in the Valley of Oaxaca during this period,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_MxAlb1L] although burnished grey ware is considered characteristic of MA I pottery.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_MxAlb1L]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Monte Albán ♥</b> Monte Albán was the largest city in the Zapotec polity at this time and had an estimated 17,242 inhabitants (or one third of the entire population of the valley).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_MxAlb1L]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Zapotec ♥</b> “…the iconography and hieroglyphic writing of Monte Albán I suggest that we are dealing with people who spoke an early version of Zapotec and practiced an early form of Zapotec religion.”[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_MxAlb1L]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic Family ♣ Otomanguean ♥</b> Both the Zapotecan (Zapotec and Chatino) and Mixtecan (Mixtec, Cuicatec and Trique) languages belong to the Otomanguean language family, which also includes: Otopamean, Chinantecan Popolocan, Huave, Amuzgo and Manguean language groups.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_MxAlb1L]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language Genus ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious Tradition ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Sect ♣ ♥</b>The Monte Albán Late I period ran from 300 to 100 BCE. Archaeologists Charles Spencer and Elsa Redmond argue that the Zapotecs had formed a state by the beginning of this period (around 300 BCE).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_MxAlb1L] The Zapotec polity based at Monte Albán started to expand to areas outside the valley at the beginning of this period, but could not yet control all areas within the Valley of Oaxaca.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_MxAlb1L] It is thought that the unification of the whole valley by the Zapotec state did not occur until the following period (Monte Albán II).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_MxAlb1L][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]There is evidence of an elite during this period. However, the nature of government is still unclear, as is the relationship between elites and non-elites.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_MxAlb1L] Richard Blanton et al. summarize the situation: 'Obviously, powerful authorities at Monte Albán could collect taxes, wage wars, engage in diplomacy, erect carved stone monuments, construct public buildings, manage urban problems, appropriate surpluses from producer households, and adjudicate disputes. But who were these authorities and how did they come to positions of power? Were there rulers or a governing council?'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_MxAlb1L][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Violent conflicts were rife, and one third of the population of the valley eventually moved to fortified or defensible settlements by the end of Monte Albán I (including Monte Albán itself, which had a three-kilometre defensive wall and was built on a defensible hill top).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_MxAlb1L] The <i>danzantes</i>, or carved images of captives, date to the first Monte Albán phases (MA Early-Late I) and may be linked with the expansionist policies and propaganda of Zapotec leaders. It is also worth noting that the richest burials date to this period  and, like the danzantes, may be linked with an expression and justification of power by Zapotec elites.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_MxAlb1L][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The population of the Zapotec polity grew during this period, particularly at Monte Albán, which housed around 17,000 people, and many new settlements were established within a roughly 30-kilometre radius of Monte Albán.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_MxAlb1L] This was part of a general trend of population nucleation during this period, particularly to sites with civic-ceremonial functions.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_MxAlb1L] The entire population of the Valley of Oaxaca during the Monte Albán IC phase has been estimated at around 50,000,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_MxAlb1L] although it is not clear whether the entire valley was under Zapotec control at this time.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_MxAlb1L]</div></body></html>
