He has also been called el prudente-"the wise" or "prudent." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_EsHabsb][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"With the passing of Felipe II, the Spanish politico-military hegemony did not by any means come to an end but would last half a century more. The Spanish sense of providential mission, however, of being the sword arm of Catholic Christendom, of expanding a divinely guided empire, was indeed beginning to wane."

In any event we must be careful not the judge the Monarchy from our own perspective of the compact nation state. The Spanish Habsburgs looked upon their network of domains as a family patrimony, and this concept of patrimony was accepted and understood by the elite.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_EsHabsb][MAJIDBENAM_BR]“It was attempts at increasing control beyond what was customary which led to unrest and rebellion, as happened with the Dutch in the sixteenth century and the Portuguese and Catalans in the seventeenth.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_EsHabsb][MAJIDBENAM_BR]“In New Spain and Peru, a series of extraordinary vicerorys brought administrative order out of the chaos of conquest and shaped a well-structured hierarchy of power that relied on the loyalty of soldiers, clerics, nobles, bureaucrats, and ordinary citizens…Some area in the Americans continued to resist Spanish control, but overall the empire functioned as an evolving fusion of Spanish and New World laws, peoples, institutions, and social structures.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_EsHabsb][MAJIDBENAM_BR]“From the time of Charles V, the military leaders of Italy, notably from the families of Gonzaga, Colonna and Medici, took service with the Spanish crown and helped to impose Spanish influence over the Italian states. At the same time, these military leaders strengthened the links of the Crown with local governing elites. The efficiency of the council of Italy lay in the fact that it was linked to a network of influence that spread throughout Italy. The community of interest, therefore, between local nobility and the distant crown, made it possible for a system of ‘empire’ to develop whereby the ruling circles benefited considerably from the Spanish presence, at the same time as they sought to make that presence less onerous. The crown had two powerful inducements it could use. It could offer posts in the bureaucracy to local nobility and thereby confirm their power; it could also distribute honours, titles, privileges and pensions, and in that way build up a network of eager clients.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_EsHabsb]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Crown of Castile and Aragon ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b> “Ferdinand and Isabella had been remarkably successful in carrying out the union of the two Crowns, but their lack of a male heir threatened to undo that work. As a result of the premature death of their only son, as well as other deaths in the family, their youngest daughter Juana stood to inherit the throne, but Juana, known as ‘La Loca’ was widely deemed incapable of ruling Spain. Because of Juana’s mental state and her marriage to a member of the Habsburg family (rulers of the Holy Roman Empire), it fell to Ferdinand and Isabella’s grandson (and Juana’s son) Charles to inherit the Spanish throne in 1516.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_EsHabsb]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ House of Bourbon-Spain ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣ ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Madrid: 1561-1601 CE; Valladolid: 1601-1606 CE; Madrid: 1606-1700 CE ♥</b>Capital in Madrid was established in 1561.

When he died in 1516 CE, his grandson Charles I—son of the Aragon Queen Joanna and the Habsburg Philip, a Prince in the Holy Roman Empire—became the first crowned King of All Spain.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Spanish Habsburg empire held territory in northern Europe, Italy, the Mediterranean, the Americas, Africa, India, and the Orient. “Yet Spain itself was rather unpromising material for greatness; the land was barren, the economy backward and the peninsula was politically fragmented.”[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_EsHabsb][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Austrian Habsburg family inherited the Valois duchy of Burgundy (present day Holland, Belgium, Luxemburg, and part of Burgundy) and the crowns of Aragon (including Balearics, Sardinia, Naples, and Sicily) and Castile (including Navarre, and the Americas- Mexico and Peru). This territory was inherited by Charles Habsburg (Charles V, 1519-56). When Charles V abdicated in 1555-56 he spilt the territory between his brother and his son (Austrian and Spanish branches of the Habsburgs), thus expanding the Spanish Habsburg Empire even further by 1556.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_EsHabsb][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Spain's territorial conquests brought in a wealth of gold and other resources from around the world. This boom led to a rapid growth in urbanization and marketization, as several Spanish cities became major hubs of production for manufactured goods (metal products and textiles especially).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_EsHabsb][MAJIDBENAM_BR]By 1550 the Habsburg Empire had a population of 29 million across the world, including 9 million native people in the lands they had colonised.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Spanish Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Spain_1500CE: 1516CE-1599CE; Spain_1600CE: 1600CE-1699CE; Spain_1700CE: 1700CE-1700CE ♥</b> Spain_1500CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_EsHabsb] Spain_1600CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_EsHabsb] Spain_1700CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_EsHabsb] </div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  572379: 1516CE-1599CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Italic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Spanish ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Christianity ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Catholicism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Sect ♣ Roman Catholic ♥</b></div></body></html>
