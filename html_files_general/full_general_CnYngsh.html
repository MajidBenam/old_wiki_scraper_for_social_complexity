[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_CnYngsh] Miaodigou is an umbrella term for many other archaeological subcultures though: "However, although sharing Miaodigou-style painted designs and some typical vessels, local archaeological cultures in these areas also show their own characteristics. While Yan’s classic definition of the Big Yangshao model is still influential, more and more archaeologists are inclined to name the local archaeological remains as independent cultures, each having its own local cultural tradition and developmental sequence (Zhang Zhongpei and Qiao 1992; Henan Sheng 1994; Wang 2010). Some scholars suggest a core-periphery model for the relationship of the local cultures with the heartland area of the Miaodigou Type (Wang 2010)."

Andersson in 1920 at Yangshao village in Mianchi county, Henan, this was the first Neolithic culture to be found in China and is still the best known. More than a thousand archaeological sites of this culture have been found distributed in the Yellow River valley from Zhengzhou in the east to the upper reaches in Gansu and Qinghai. Within this vast area, the culture can be divided into several phases on the basis of ceramic styles. All of these, however, are of reddish color and are painted with various designs in black or dark brown (Fig. 1.4). Major vessel types include the bowl, water bottle, jar, and urn. Tripods and bowls on ring stands are seen in the east only, possibly being forms introduced from the eastern coastal areas.The Yangshao was a culture of millet farmers, already planting both Setaria and Panicum millets. The people lived in lineage units regularly laid out in villages.

For example, among pottery vessel types, the ding and the dou are found in every region, often in large numbers, suggesting the wide distribution of a style of cooking formerly prevailing only in the Dawenkou and Daxi cultures. The perforated slate rectangular and semilunar knives represent another horizon marker, as do some pottery and jade art motifs that, as pointed out earlier, may reflect deeper substratal commonalities than recent contact. With the definition of "interaction spheres," for the first time we can discuss the issue of the name "China." I suggest that from this point on, as the regions with which we are concerned came to be joined together in archaeological terms and exhibit increasing similarities, the interaction sphere may be referred to as "Chinese."

Men most likely hunted, and men and women farmed and produced goods.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_CnYngsh][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Yangshao villages were often surrounded by a ditch, and contained groups of semi-subterranean round or square houses constructed using the wattle and daub method, a graveyard and a public courtyard.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_CnYngsh] Homes contained hearths for cooking and wide benches.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_CnYngsh] Yangshao culture is characterized by the presence of painted black and red pottery featuring animals and geometric designs.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_CnYngsh]Pottery, jewelry and stone, bone and ceramic tools have been excavated from Yangshao period graves.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_CnYngsh][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the early Yangshao phase, settlements did not have any detectable hierarchies. In the later phase, structures in the settlements began to vary in size, suggesting the existence of settlement hierarchies.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_CnYngsh] In many villages, a large structure is surrounded by smaller dwellings.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_CnYngsh] However, grave goods in Yangshao burials suggest a more egalitarian society.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_CnYngsh] More information is needed on settlement hierarchy and community organization in the Yangshao period. The population of Yangshao settlements varied- smaller settlements had 70 to 80 members while larger settlements housed a few hundred.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_CnYngsh]</div></body></html>
