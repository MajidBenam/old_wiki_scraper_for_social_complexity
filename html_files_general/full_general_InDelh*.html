To maintain a full treasury, the sultan raised the land tax to 50 percent of each crop and strictly enforced its collection from all Hindu subjects in his realm. He also introduced two new taxes, one on milk cattle, the other on houses. His network of spies and loyal courtiers was efficient enough to make him more feared than hated. He introduced a successful system of wage and price control in Delhi. Private holding of gold and silver, common throughout much of Indian history, was temporarily ended during his reign. The prices of food, grains, and cloth were kept low enough to permit soldiers and average workers to survive without high salaries. Merchants were licensed, and their profits were kept under strict state control; peasants were obliged to sell their grains only to registered food merchants at fixed prices. Hoarding was forbidden and, if discovered, severely punished. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_InDelh*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Sultanate was at its height during the early fourteenth century CE, when it was the largest polity in South Asia.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_InDelh*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 1206-1526 CE ♥</b>Start date 1206 CE&nbsp;: Muhammad Bakhtiyar Khalji was murdered in 1206 CE and his vast empire seemed on the verge of disintegration. After the death of his master Muhammad, Qutb-ud-din took the decisive stage of declaring his independence from the Ghurids. Iltutmish, Qutb-ud-din's son-in-low, succeeded him in 1210 CE, and in 1229 CE he was solemnly consecrated as Sultan of Delhi by a representative of the Abbasid Caliph of Baghdad. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_InDelh*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]End Date 1526 CE: Daulat Khan Lodi, the governer of Punjab and a member of the Sultan’s own tribe, rebelled and sought the assistance of Babur, the ruler of Kabul. Babur who was a direct descendant of both Temür and Genghis Khan, had already invaded India three times in an effort to reestablish his family’s supremacy there. He welcomed Daulat Khan’s invitation, captured Lahore in 1524 CE, and two years later advanced on Delhi. The armies of Babur and Sultan Ibrahim (1517 CE-1526 CE) met at Panipat north of Delhi on April 20, 1526 CE. Ibrahim was killed in battle. Babur and his successors became the most powerful dynasty in Indian history, the Mughal emperors. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_InDelh*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ confederated state ♥</b>Centralisation only lasted for a few decades before the polity become much more loosely organised.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_InDelh*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"the Delhi Sultanate was more like a conglomeration of nearly-independent principalities, jagirs and provinces, each ruled by a hereditary chief or zamindar, with their subjects looking more to their immediate governors who had absolute power in the provinces than the sovereign who was far away."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_InDelh*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Only the area around the capital and a few major fortresses elsewhere, were under the direct rule of the sultan. Outlying areas were administered either by Muslim governors appointed from Delhi or by Hindu kings who recognized the sultan’s supremacy. Across most of the sultanate, local power remained in the hands of petty Hindu chieftains. In return for paying the land revenue to muqtas, subject kings, provincial governors, or sultans, the chieftains were allowed to rule their tiny kingdoms more or less as they pleased. Governers and kings alike assumed independence whenever the sultanate was too weak to keep them in check.

After shifting to Daulatabad Muhammad Tughluq lost his control over North India without being able to consolidate his hold on the South. When he finally returned to Delhi this was taken as a sign of weakness and independent states arose in the South. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_InDelh*]. Sikander, the Lodi Sultan, built a new capital at Agra. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_InDelh*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Sikandar (1489 CE -1517 CE) moved the capital down the Yamuna river, from Delhi to Agra, so that he could better watch his outlying dependencies. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_InDelh*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Persian; Urdu ♥</b> Persian (official language). Sanskrit was used by Hindus and local dialects were spoken by the general population  The process of Hindus learning the Persian language for employment in state service caused an upsurge from below. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_InDelh*] Urdu "a mixture of Arabic, Persian, Turkish and Hindu" was developing as a common language.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_InDelh*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Genus ♣ Islam ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Family ♣ Sunni ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Genus ♣ Islam ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Family ♣ Sufi ♥</b> "Two other developments were distinctive to the period.

See the general description for reality of power holding. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_InDelh*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Delhi Sultanate (1206-1526 CE) was created when Muhammad Qutb-ud-din declared his independence from the Ghurids, which in turn followed the defeat of the last Hindu ruler of Delhi in 1192 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_InDelh*] Qutb-ud-din's successor, his son, had his rule as Sultan of Delhi legitimized by a representative of the Abbasid Caliph of Baghdad.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_InDelh*] The Sultanate lasted 320 years which spanned five successive Turko-Afghan dynasties (Mamluk Dynasty, Khalji Dynasty, Tughlaq Dynasty, Sayyid Dynasty and Lodi Dynasty) that spread Islam and the Persian language of administration in northern India.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_InDelh*][MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_InDelh*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Delhi Sultanate had a highly-complex central administration but was not a centralized state. In the provinces, much of its power was devolved to local Hindu rulers and landholders.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_InDelh*] Only the area around Delhi was ruled directly by the Sultan, and here units of land given to military commanders, in return for the right to collect revenue.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_InDelh*] According to Habib (2005) any centralisation that existed only lasted for a few decades before the polity become much more loosely organised.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_InDelh*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Ala al-Din (r.1296-1316 CE) reorganized the revenue and administrative systems in order to support a large standing army. A successful army was crucial for maintaining the personal authority of the Delhi Sultan in India and for expanding, or defending, territory. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_InDelh*] By the fourteenth century, the vizier of the Sultan became more powerful. Whilst earlier his duties were confined only to the military, they were extended to revenue affairs. The vizier was responsible for fiscal administration, income and expenditure, appointment of officials, and the collection of taxes.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_InDelh*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Hindus joined the ranks of the administrative class[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_InDelh*] and "many elements of the Rajput political system, with or without changes, were incorporated into the Turkish administration in India."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_InDelh*] Under the later dynasties, revenue collection began to be less efficient, and conflicts between elite power-holders emerged. The Sultanate ended when Ibrahim was defeated by Babur, the Mongol ruler, in 1526 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_InDelh*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Delhi Sultanate ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Delhi_1200CE: 1206CE-1299CE; Delhi_1300CE: 1300CE-1399CE; Delhi_1400CE: 1400CE-1499CE; Delhi_1500CE: 1500CE-1526CE ♥</b>  Delhi_1200CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_InDelh*] Delhi_1300CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_InDelh*] Delhi_1400CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_InDelh*] Delhi_1500CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_InDelh*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  1625768: 1206CE-1299CE;  1676354: 1300CE-1399CE;  1111682: 1400CE-1499CE;  859750: 1500CE-1526CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Dravidian ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Tamiloid ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Tamil ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Islam ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Sunni Islam ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition ♣ Islam ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religion Family ♣ Suffism ♥</b></div></body></html>
