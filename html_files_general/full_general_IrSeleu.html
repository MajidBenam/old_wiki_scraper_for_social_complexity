The empire reached a peak in territory and population during the reign of it's first king, Seleucus I, when the empire took it's 'final form' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_IrSeleu]. A second peak in territory and population size occurred during the reign of Antiochus III 'The Great' (223 BCE - 187 BCE), who reconquered lost territory and reaffirmed the status of the empire [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_IrSeleu].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 312-63 BCE ♥</b> The rule of the first king of the Seleucid Empire, Seleucus I, began when he was apportioned the satrapy of Babylonia in 319 BCE after the death of Alexander the Great [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_IrSeleu]. However, in 315 BCE Seleucus was overthrown by Antigonus,  but regained power in 312 BCE and began to extend the kingdom. The beginning of the empire is therefore generally agreed to start from Seleucus' return to power in 312 BCE [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_IrSeleu] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_IrSeleu].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The end of the empire was characterized by a decline from the former power of the kings, to the extent that Aperghis (2004, p27, 298) argues that after 129 BCE, when King Antiochus VII committed suicide in Media, the Seleucid Empire had degraded to the Seleucid Kingdom, and would only decline further. Opposition from the indigenous population and from growing rival states (the Parthians and Romans) culminated in irreversible decline for the Seleucids.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_IrSeleu] The remaining polity was eventually overtaken by the growing Roman empire in 64/63 BCE [MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_IrSeleu] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_IrSeleu].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ unitary state; confederate state ♥</b>The Seleucid kings kept as much power as possible in their own hands, and had the final authority over decisions of the state, including the appointment of regional governors [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_IrSeleu] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_IrSeleu].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Prior to the Parthians, political systems in Southwest Asia were for the most part relatively loose confederations in which central government ruled their 'empires' through unstable alliances with vassals and satraps. Even Hammurabi, Darius, and Alexander were only temporarily successful in linking their centralized governments to local administrative institutions, particularly outside of the core areas of Greater Mesopotamia."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_IrSeleu]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ nominal allegiance ♥</b> nominal allegiance: [204-192 BCE] After the death of Ptolemy IV, Antiochus became a 'friend and ally' of the Roman Empire, but without a formal treaty.

The city grew to a population of 50,000-100,000 inhabitants in an area of roughly 550 hectares [MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_IrSeleu].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Greek ♥</b> Greek was used for most written documents.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_IrSeleu] Local languages presumably continued to be spoken (as the Seleucids allowed local religious cults to continue practicing without imposed Hellenistic influences [MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_IrSeleu], but the textual bias is towards Greek written documents.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Genus ♣ Hellenistic Religions ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Family ♣ Seleucid Religion ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Genus ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion ♣ ♥</b>The Seleucid Empire arose in the years following the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE and the subsequent division of his empire. Alexander’s generals each ruled part of the empire, including Seleucus I who became leader of the Babylonian territory in 319 BCE as a reward for having helped Alexander eliminate the regent Perdiccas [MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_IrSeleu]. This date does not however mark the start of the Seleucid Empire as Seleucus was ousted by the rival Antigonus in 315 BCE and did not return to power until 312 BCE, after which the Seleucid Empire truly began as Seleucus began to extent his domain to create an empire large enough to include territories in the Central Asian steppe to European Thrace [MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_IrSeleu]. Seleucus’ territorial achievements were matched by only one of his successors, Antiochus III, whose rule began 60 years later. The last rulers of the empire could not match the charisma and drive of these earlier rulers, especially in the face of growing powers to the west and east of the empire (Rome and Parthia respectively). The empire declined in size and influence until it was taken over by Rome in 63 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Seleucid Empire continued to exert the Hellenistic influences of Alexander the Great’s empire, but like Alexander, the rulers of the Seleucid Empire generally allowed other religions and languages to continue and flourish (a notable exception being the persecution of the Jews by Antiochus IV) [MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_IrSeleu]. Most written documents are in Greek and contain valuable information about the empire, the battles fought and the kings who ruled. The documents are however far from complete and many aspects of the empire are either inferred from other sources or remain unknown. Overall it can be surmised that the Seleucid Empire was ruled by one king at a time who held central authority, but who exerted that authority through his commanders, or satraps, in the various territories of the empire [MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_IrSeleu]. This both gave the king a great amount of power but also made him vulnerable to the ambitions of his satraps, the most notable example being the betrayal of the general Achaios who in 220 BCE took the territories of Asia Minor for himself after conducting campaigns there on behalf of Antiochus III [MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_IrSeleu].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Seleucids ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Seleucid_300BCE: 312BCE-201BCE; Seleucid_200BCE: 200BCE-101BCE; Seleucid_100BCE: 100BCE-63BCE ♥</b>  Seleucid_100BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_IrSeleu] Seleucid_200BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_IrSeleu] Seleucid_300BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_IrSeleu]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  2742225: 312BCE-201BCE;  2234817: 200BCE-101BCE;  79996: 100BCE-63BCE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Graeco-Phrygian ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Greek ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Ancient Mediterranean Religion ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Ancient Mediterranean Paganism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Sect ♣ Ancient Graeco-Phrygian Paganism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition ♣ Zoroastrianism ♥</b></div></body></html>
