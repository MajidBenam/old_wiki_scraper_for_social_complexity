The Tierras Largas phase was a period of “egalitarian or “autonomous village” society, where status could be achieved but not inherited (as suggested by three burials of potentially higher status individuals at San José Mogote and Tierras Largas)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_MxTieLa].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥</b> This phase was characterised by a number of small settlements, with the exception of one larger site (San José Mogote) [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_MxTieLa].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Archaic Period ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b> The main difference between this period and the preceding Archaic Period are the emergence of the Tierras Largas ceramic complex, an increase in the number of settlements and a larger settlement at San José Mogote.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_MxTieLa]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ MxSanGu ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ Early Formative ♥</b> The groups occupying the Valley of Oaxaca at this time were relatively simple, settled communities which shared a widespread ceramic complex (the Tierras Largas pottery). There are no distinct cultural differences across the region at this time and the supracultural entity has therefore been coded as the general phase name for sites of this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_MxTieLa]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣ 3,000 ♥</b>km squared. As there are no distinct cultural differences between the material culture of communities in the valley of this period, the area of the valley has been coded here.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ none ♥</b> The largest settlement was San José Mogote, but there is no evidence for a unified polity and so the settlement cannot be called a capital.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ ♥</b> There are no written records from this phase, but later evidence shows that people in the valley spoke Zapotec, possibly from the succeeding San José Mogote phase, and the Otomanguean language families may have split before the start of this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_MxTieLa]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic Family ♣ Proto-Otomanguean ♥</b> Both the Zapotecan (Zapotec and Chatino) and Mixtecan (Mixtec, Cuicatec and Trique) languages belong to the Otomanguean language family, which also includes: Otopamean, Chinantecan Popolocan, Huave, Amuzgo and Manguean language groups.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_MxTieLa]. These language groups diverged between around 2100 BCE-1400 CE but it is not known exactly when each language or dialect split . It is however likely that Zapotecan and Mixtecan had diverged by 3700 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_MxTieLa]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language Genus ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious Tradition ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Sect ♣ ♥</b>The Tierras Largas phase refers to the period from 1400 to 1150 BCE. It was named for an archaeological site in the Etla subregion of the Valley of Oaxaca, Southern Mexico.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_MxTieLa][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]There is no evidence for a widespread unified polity during the Tierras Largas phase, and very little indication of social differentiation between or within communities. The period has therefore been characterized as one of egalitarian social organization, in which status could perhaps be achieved but not inherited.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_MxTieLa] The population, estimated at 500-1000, was dispersed throughout the valley with settlements clustered on the most fertile land in the Etla arm.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_MxTieLa][MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_MxTieLa][MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_MxTieLa][MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_MxTieLa] Most of these settlements were small (between one and three hectares), except for San José Mogote, which was larger (seven hectares), had a defensive palisade and featured larger buildings that could have been used as public spaces.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_MxTieLa] However, there is no evidence that the influence of San José Mogote extended beyond the village to other settlements.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_MxTieLa] The 'type site', Tierras Largas, covered around 1.6-2.2 ha and consisted of 5-10 households with nearby storage pits.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_MxTieLa] The inhabitants of the valley cultivated domestic crops and supplemented their diet by gathering wild fruits and hunting animals. More intensive forms of agriculture had not yet developed.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_MxTieLa]</div></body></html>
