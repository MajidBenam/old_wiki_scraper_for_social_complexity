Alliances were created for many possible reasons, including political gain, status and increased access to farmland and resources.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_MxAlb5*]  <span style="color:blue">No permanent unions between polities; these alliances seem between individuals.</span></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Monte Alban IIIB and IV  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b> The process of political balkanisation which started at the end of the MA IIIA period continued into this period until the Spanish invasion. Separate kingdoms formed, with Monte Alban still occupied but with a much reduced population.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_MxAlb5*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Spanish colonial rule ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ none ♥</b> There was no single capital in the valley. Instead there were a series of smaller polities, each with a head town and other smaller settlements.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_MxAlb5*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Zapotec ♥</b> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_MxAlb5*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic Family ♣ Otomanguean ♥</b> Both the Zapotecan (Zapotec and Chatino) and Mixtecan (Mixtec, Cuicatec and Trique) languages belong to the Otomanguean language family, which also includes: Otopamean, Chinantecan Popolocan, Huave, Amuzgo and Manguean language groups.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_MxAlb5*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language Genus ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious Tradition ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Sect ♣ ♥</b>The Monte Alban V period is generally known for the balkianisation of polities in the valley.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_MxAlb5*] The length assigned to the Monte Albán V phase is due to the consistency of ceramic style throughout the period, and lack of evidence for major changes in other archaeological remains. There may have been many changes over these centuries, but it has been argued that the conservatism of ceramics suggests a time of relative political stability.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_MxAlb5*] The primary evidence for this period comes from the accounts written by the Spanish after they arrived in the 1520s. This means that there is much more information than previous periods for certain aspects of life for the inhabitants of Oaxaca, such as the name for the head of the ruling class (the coquitao or “great lord”) and full-time priests (bigaña),[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_MxAlb5*] but less information in other respects as there were no longer any monumental buildings or large settlements being constructed. The unified valley under the Zapotec state had gone by this period, replaced by around 15-20 smaller polities[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_MxAlb5*][MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_MxAlb5*] which were often fighting one another (as suggested by the widespread use of fortifications and descriptions in the ethnohistoric records),[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_MxAlb5*] but the overall population of the valley continued to increase to the highest number yet reached in the valley.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_MxAlb5*] In addition, craft work and specialisation became more widespread, with more finely decorated ceramics being produced throughout the valley and were not just concentrated in the main settlements as before.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_MxAlb5*]</div></body></html>
