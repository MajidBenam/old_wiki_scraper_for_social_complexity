[...] Chronological reconstructions fall into two groups. Advocates of the now largely discredited 'long chronology' support the maximal span of c. 475 years derived from the literal reading of the [Puranic king lists] [...]. This interpretation is problematic given the historical context of the Puranas, the lack of concordance among the texts, and the lack of supporting numismatic or incriptional evidence for many of the rulers named. "Advocates of the more widely accepted 'short chronology' [...] combine Puranic records with other lines of numismatic, archaeological, and textual evidence and date the Satavahana rule from the beginning of the first century BCE to the end of the second century CE. Even here, many scholars are reluctant to assign absolute dates to specific kings and those who do often select quite disparate dates and name different rulers. Nonetheless, the shorter chronology is the more reasonable given current evidence [...]" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_InSataL].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ loose; unitary state ♥</b>"The fragmentation of the kingdom was inevitable as the Satavahana state was very loosely organized, with the local administration, even the maintenance of the royal army, being largely left to their feudatories, who even struck their own coins. This loose state organization was necessitated by the limited economic resources of the  kingdom; the soil of their land being poor, the Satavahanas could not afford to maintain a large standing army or an elaborate administrative organization."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_InSataL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Only centralized after moving east after 140 CE: "The continued invasions by the Sakas of Ujjain (Malwa) and the prospects of encroaching upon the rich regions in the southern and eastern Deccan prompted them to shift their political base to the east around AD 140. The Satavahana state brought with it an organized administration and bureaucracy, a standing army, garrison towns, provincial administrative headquarters and a fortified capital."</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥</b> Independent polity.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Mauryan Empire ♥</b> NOTE: The Mauryan Empire was the most powerful polity to rule over Southern India before the Satavahanas [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_InSataL].

Under their governance, Indian commerce with the Western world intensified and there was a florescence of the arts, particularly in the field of Buddhist iconography.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_InSataL] However, records are scanty when it comes to the empire's middle century, which suggests that the Satavahana polity went through two phases of power and prosperity, with an intervening period of regionalization, and perhaps even collapse.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_InSataL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Satavahana polity was ruled by an emperor.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_InSataL] He was aided, at court, by a number of officials, including attendants and advisors, the <i>mahasenapati</i> (army commander), the superintendent of stores, the treasurer, officials tasked with drafting and registering his documents, and officials tasked with supervising feudal lords.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_InSataL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_InSataL] The provinces were governed by feudal lords who were related by blood to the royal family, by lords who struck coins in their own name (perhaps indicating some degree of autonomy from the Satavahanas themselves), and by military commanders in charge of outlying centres.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_InSataL] The fact that the empire likely suffered some sort of collapse in its middle period suggests that it may have been overly dependent on the abilities of individual rulers rather than a well-designed administrative structure.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_InSataL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]No population estimates for this period could be found in the specialist literature.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Satavahana Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Satavanahas_100BCE: 100BCE-1BCE; Satavanahas_0CE: 0CE-99CE; Satavanahas_100CE: 100CE-199CE; Satavanahas_200CE: 200CE-200CE ♥</b>  Satavanahas_0CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_InSataL] Satavanahas_100BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_InSataL] Satavanahas_100CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_InSataL] Satavanahas_200CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_InSataL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  474650: 100BCE-1BCE;  854495: 0CE-99CE;  747833: 100CE-199CE;  905347: 200CE-200CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Indo-Iranian ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Prakrit ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Hinduism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Shaivism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition ♣ Hinduism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religion Family ♣ Bhagavatism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition2 ♣ Jainism ♥</b></div></body></html>
