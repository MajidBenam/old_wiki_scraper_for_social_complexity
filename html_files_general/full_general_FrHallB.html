A cluster of dispersed farms gravitate around a monument, a sort of tomb-sanctuary, which symbolizes the unity of the territorial community. This community is ruled by a chief who occupies one of the farms. 2. A cluster of farmsteads polarized by a village, near which is found the territorial sanctuary. ... 3. Identical in organization to #2, but the central role of the village is held by a fortification. It appears that this type of settlement owes its existence to the control it exerted over long-distance exchange, especially over exchange in metal."

The Greek and Etruscan towns experienced an increasing demand for raw materials which led them to enlarge their supply areas until they embraced a large part of the continent. In this vast exchange system, certain well-positioned local chiefs played the role of privileged intermediaries. They were able to monopolize trade and exchange, and controlled the supply of Mediterranean prestigue goods, ultimately extending their influence into neighbouring territories. They reduced local rulers to vassal status.

It coincides with the North Alpine complex, extending over modern-day central and southern Germany, northern Italy, and Switzerland.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_FrHallB][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the Hallstatt B period (c. 1000-800 BCE),[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_FrHallB] the North Alpine cultural complex gradually became incorporated in trade networks dominated by Greek and Etruscan settlements. Hallstatt chiefs mediated the supply of Mediterranean prestige goods in their own spheres of exchange.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_FrHallB][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The average scale of integration of Hallstatt B polities extended to include land within a roughly 25-kilometre radius.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_FrHallB] The maximal territorial extent of polities could be as much as 1000 square kilometres, as in the case of Wessex.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_FrHallB][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In this period, a three-tiered settlement hierarchy can be discerned archaeologically. Previous units fragmented: new autonomous communities polarized around fortified sites, the proportion of which increased. Tumuli became a more noticeable feature in the Hallstatt B landscape, and iron-working activity became much more prevalent.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_FrHallB]</div></body></html>
