For areas of Anatolia, two additional terms were introduced: Aceramic Neolithic and Chalcolithic. The latter is not, as the name would suggest, determined on the basis of copper artifacts, but on the basis of the emergence of painted pottery. It derives from Mesopotamia, where the division of the Neolithic and the Chalcolithic was related to the introduction of painted pottery.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The most recent attempt to construct a healthy chronological scheme for the Central Anatolian Neolithic was proposed by the CANeW workshop[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_TrClcER]. On the basis of the archaeological evidence from various sites in the region, the time trajectories of the development were identified, taking into account not a wide scope of aspects - architectural developments, burial practices, material culture (pottery, lithic industry, metallurgy etc.) and economy. The main unit of the proposed scheme is ECA - Early Central Anatolian. The ECA IV (6000-5500 cal BC) corresponds to what is conventionally labeled as 'Early Chalcolithic'.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]At the start of the Early Chalcolithic, around 6000 cal. BC, we can see a continuation of the changes settlement patterns that began in the Late Neolithic. This period is marked by a shift in settlement from Çatalhöyük East to Çatalhöyük West and the existence of full- farming sites such as Can Hasan I, Koşk Höyük and Tepecik-Çiftlik. The number of sites in the region increased [MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_TrClcER].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The date 5500 cal BC marks a major disruption: most of the sites were abandoned. This date marks the beginning of the Middle Chalcolithic - it is a completely new period different from the preceding, a prelude of a new system[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_TrClcER]. The nature of this major breakage is still under-recognized.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]As for radiocarbon dating:The levels II-V (Neolithic and Chalcolithic)of Koşk Höyük date to 6300-5600 cal BC[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_TrClcER].From the Early Chalcolithic Level 3 at Tepecik - Çiftlik, we have a single c14 date - around 6000 BC[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_TrClcER].Six radiocarbon dates are available from Can Hasan 2B which, when combined, provide a time range between 5715-5635 cal. BCE. Absolute dates from levels 7-3 are not available[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_TrClcER].As for the Çatalhöyük West, the c14 samples were taken from a deep sounding and cannot draw a conclusive picture yet. Nevertheless, onedate 5980 to 5810 cal BC (68% probability[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_TrClcER]).</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ quasi-polity ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣  ♥</b>The area of Central Anatolia is distinct for the fact that each site corresponds to a separate culture.

However, it is possible that Can Hasan I, which would provide smaller villages with raw materials, could have had a similar function. Also, Çatalhöyük West, with its 8 ha, is much larger than other sites, and it has beem suggested that it played a role of a central site[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_TrClcER].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Indo-European language ♥</b>  Indo-European language&nbsp;?

There is a hypothesis proposed by Colin Renfrew in 1987 - that Indo-European languages ​​began to spread with the beginning of agriculture[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_TrClcER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The work on this codebook is focused on the area of the Central Anatolia Plain (including Cappadocia with occasional references to Cilicia) and North-Central Anatolia within the bend of the Kızılırmak River. The main sites include Çatalhöyük West, Canhasan, Yümüktepe / Mersin, Köşk Höyük, Gelveri Güzelyurt, Tepecik - Çiftlik, Gözlükule / Tarsus. The majority of the data was obtained from reports of excavations at three of the mentioned sites: Çatalhöyük West, Canhasan and Köşk Höyük. The chronology for areas of Central Anatolia is based on a modified version of the three-age system developed in European archaeology (Stone, Bronze and Iron ages). However, for the Anatolian areas, it was necessary to introduce two additional terms: Aceramic Neolithic and Chalcolithic. The latter was to be determined on the basis of copper artifacts. However, it became known that the origins of manufacturing copper tools date back to Aceramic Neolithic. So, instead, the beginning of the Chalcolithic in Central Anatolia came to be determined by the emergence of painted pottery.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Some geometric wall paintings and decorations on ceramics from the Early Chalcolithic period have been found, and can be considered as 'Nonwritten records'. Pottery in the Early Chalcolithic is mostly painted. The majority of these paintings are red or brown straight-line geometric motifs, applied over a cream or yellowish-buff slip. In addition to the expanded production of ceramics, stone and flint was used for tools. However, the dominant material for manufacturing tools was obsidian, which was probably imported from the Ilıcapınar areas (Cappadocian sources- Niğde area, where sites of Tepecik - Çiftlik and Köşk Höyük are located-PF). Metallurgy of the period is not different from that of the Neolithic, except for copper pins and small ornaments at Mersin XXII-XXI.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The area of Central Anatolia is distinguished by the fact that each site corresponds to a separate culture. However, the contacts between them are possible, since there are similarities in the pottery decorations and in architecture.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Completing the codebook for Early Chalcolithic Konya Plain was not an easy task, as we do not always have a requisite amount of relevant data from archaeological research. However, an attempt was made to reconstruct the functioning of the societies of the Early Chalcolithic period, based on the data available. The information was primarily gathered from the reports from excavations, as well as general studies on prehistoric areas of Anatolia. The most problematic variables were, for example, "Society variables" , "Law", "Bureaucracy characteristics", for it is a society for which we have no written sources.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Floors were made of compact clay.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Many clay figurines were recovered from one of the burnt structures (House 3) at Can Hasan in 2B level as well as a clay spindle-whorl; sling stones; stoppers; and animal figurines. Some of the women figurines in various sizes are flat and schematic; but the eyes; ears; nose; and chin were clearly depicted. Plain or painted ones are existent. Another group was depicted in crouching or sitting position. Their necks are high and details are observed to be shown besides the chin. They are all painted." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_TrClcER] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_TrClcER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]At Çatalhöyük West, L-shaped clay objects were found, with geometric incised decorations. The same objects were also found in Çatalhöyük East [MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_TrClcER].In total,  nearly 400 of those objects were recorded at Çatalhöyük[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_TrClcER]. These are the so-called 'potstands'. Placed in pairs over the fire they would support a cooking pot[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_TrClcER]. As they appear in the Late Neolithic, they may be an important index of shift away the use of interior fixed architectural fire installations for cooking, towards the use of ceramic vessels balanced on potstands [MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_TrClcER].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Potstands have been also found at Can Hasan (mainly in levels II and I).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_TrClcER].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"In all Chalcolithic Age levels of Yumuktepe; baked clay spindle whorls and clay sling pallets are the dominant types. There are also loom weights and a number of figurines." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_TrClcER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"At Gelveri Güzelyurt a baked clay animal figurine is the only figurine for now. There are other clay finds like a brush and a pintaderas stamp. A female figurine was found during 2007 excavations made of terra cotta with coarse paste in beige color." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_TrClcER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]At Köşk Höyük in level I were found two female figurines: one seated, the other standing and two horn-shaped objects recovered in the so-called sanctuary[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_TrClcER]. Also at level II, there were more female figurines found, whole and pieces.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Wooden supports in two-storied buildings. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_TrClcER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]It may be assumed the wood was easily obtained as the forests covered vast areas in the region [MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_TrClcER].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Pieces of blades and flakes were found at 2A at Can Hasan." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_TrClcER] "Careless work is observed in flintstone and obsidian tools of 2B." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_TrClcER] "Blades and flakes made of obsidian were recovered from the third level. A retouched piece is thought to be used as a perforator." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_TrClcER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"At Yumuktepe level XXIV was found tools in Neolithic tradition and biface points are observed to continue. In general; blade and large flake industries are dominant. Both obsidian and flint are used." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_TrClcER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Obsidian tools were found at Gelveri Güzelyurt: knives and scrapers shaped from flake-blades. Long sickle blades are also present. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_TrClcER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]At Köşk Höyük, obsidian is the dominant material for producing tools.Also, pieces of obsidian mirrors have been found.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Cappadocian sources - Göllüdağ and Nenezi Dağ- are of significance since the Neolithic period[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_TrClcER].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Polychrome stone vessels; stone and shell beads; axes; marble bracelets; and grinding stones were recovered from the 2A level at Can Hasan."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_TrClcER]" Grinding stones; mortar; pestles; shallow bowls; spouted vessels; marble bracelets; and stopper were recovered from the 2B structures."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_TrClcER] "The ground stone finds of the third level consist of pestles; grinding stones; and beads."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_TrClcER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Small stone bowls made out of white or red- green marble were recovered from Köşk Höyük; other stone finds include: celts, querns, mortars, pestles, hammering and grinding stones[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_TrClcER].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]At Tepecik-Çiftlik stone artefacts include mortars, pestles, grinding slabs, basins made of basalt and rhyolite, axes made of limestone and basalt and finally- polishing stones made out of pebbles[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_TrClcER].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The site of Çatalhöyük West brought about a number of stone tools: these are grinding stones (querns), axes, pestles and stone vessels[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_TrClcER]. The raw material of these artefacts is usually of volcanic origin.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]At Gelveri Güzelyurt, many stone tools were found, e.g. vessels, numerous broken pestles and mace heads. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_TrClcER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Flat axes (polished {?} flat axe) in various sizes and grinding stones are recovered almost in all levels; from Level XXIV at Yumuktepe site. There are stone object pieces that are interpreted as idols by the excavator."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_TrClcER]At the sites of the land of Cappadocia, stone was used for building houses (among others, the sites Köşk Höyük and Tepecik-Çiftlik)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_TrClcER].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"A piece of copper; and traces of copper / bronze observed on earth hint the existence of usage of metal at 2A level at Can Hasan. A mace head made of copper; a bracelet made of copper or bronze found on the arm of a skeleton; and a piece of copper were recovered from 2B level at Can Hasan." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_TrClcER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The most interesting finds of the site are the copper finds. One of the oldest copper pins in Anatoila is recovered in Levels XXIII-XX at Yumuktepe." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_42_TrClcER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Beads made of shells; and although its raw material is not known for sure; a bracelet made of ivory from 2A level at Can Hasan are the other interesting finds." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_43_TrClcER] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_44_TrClcER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]At Gözlükule/Tarsus, a lead ring and other lead pieces were found[MAJIDBENAM_REF_45_TrClcER].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Bone finds like axe rod-handles made of antler; hammers; awl; spatula; bone hook; palettes; and points were recovered from the 2A settlement at Can Hasan. One of the spatulas are decorated with geometric motifs. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_46_TrClcER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Awls and pins are existent; carrying the same features; in all levels at Yumuktepe." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_47_TrClcER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Among stones used for making of ornaments at Tepecik - Çiftlik are pyrites, goethites, limestones, turquoises, malachites  and azurites[MAJIDBENAM_REF_48_TrClcER].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The most common bone finds inside level 3 during 2007 campaign at Tepecik - Çiftlik are the awls. This is followed in quantity by a large amount of "phalanx idols" made of the phalanx bones of wild horses and wild donkeys." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_49_TrClcER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Beads made out of marine shells are recovered on a floor form Level II at Köşk Höyük. The researches that were performed on the southern wing in 2005 revealed a burnishing stone made of hematite; and a pig head shaped necklace bead made of agate underneath the floor in the northern half in phase I. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_50_TrClcER] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_51_TrClcER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]On Köşk Höyük pottery, we can see a scene of agricultural work that looks like harvesting crops[MAJIDBENAM_REF_52_TrClcER].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Technically, Early Chalcolithic metalwork is virtually indistinguishable from that of the Neolithic, except for copper pins and small ornament at Mersin XXII-XXI, which suggest an interest in small luxury items." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_53_TrClcER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"At Yumuktepe at level XXIV was found rectangular structures with stone foundations and round storage bins; most probably in open courts. The storage bins are interpreted as granaries." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_54_TrClcER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]At Köşk Höyük at level I, in the Northeastern trench, is an area interpreted as a sanctuary[MAJIDBENAM_REF_55_TrClcER]. "The sanctuary/cult building in level II is a rectangular structure with a regular sill and door. In this two-partitioned sanctuary; horns and bones of bulls and cows are found well-arranged on a platform. The place is interpreted as a sanctuary due to the relief decoration on a potsherd. The relief is of a human figure with thin and long body; and a scepter in one hand; interpreted as a god." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_56_TrClcER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]At Gelveri Güzelyurt an alley/street was found, which extends in the East-West direction between buildings inside trech AI[MAJIDBENAM_REF_57_TrClcER].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]During 2002 excavations at Köşk Höyük, two streets were found at the site[MAJIDBENAM_REF_58_TrClcER].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Based on the available data, it can be concluded that there was some exchange. But it was rather the exchange of ideas and thoughts on the technical side, rather than the exchange of finished materials.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Pottery imports. This is just a hypothesis, since the ceramics show, inter alia, the influence of Halaf culture.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_59_TrClcER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The ceramics of Can Hasan 2B began largely as a mixture of painted (red-on-cream wash)and burnished wares: vertical and horizontal rows of zigzag lines are the basic painted patterns. Gradually, the quality of both types improve, and the burnished fabrics (gray, red-brown and buff) have their surfaces both well polished and incised; in the last building level a new pottery type appears - white-slipped red ware with painted designs of simple horizontal lines and cross-hatched triangles executed in brown or black." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_60_TrClcER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Ceramics at Yumuktepe Level XXIV: White incrustation on black surface is seen on sherds; besides the Hassuna-like pottery with red paint decoration on crème surface or with incised decoration. Levels XXIII-XX: The same wares continue with little change in the decoration motifs[MAJIDBENAM_REF_61_TrClcER]. Painted pottery similar to painted Halaf wares that were scarce in lower levels increase in number from Level XX on. There are also sherds related with Can Hasan III, Çatalhöyük West, and Hacilar.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Pottery of Köşk Höyük is hand-made and consist mostly of monochrome wares with black; dark gray; light and dark red pastes. Level II yields a small amount of polichrome ware with geometric decorations painted in red; brown; and black on light colored surface. Geometrical decorations are applied also by incrustation; but rarely. The forms are bowls with or without handles; mugs; rectangular vessels; globular vases with long neck; everted rim; and flat base; storage jars of various sizes."
