He gave presents and rations to the people, yet, though he found the Treasury ruined, he brought it round, by his own hard work, into a flourishing state. ... Thus he so charmed the nations near him that they entered into a league with him, hoping that he would be their King. The merchants, too, from diverse provinces, flocked to his dominions, for so great was the order which he maintained, that if any one wished to leave gold or silver on his land (in his country house) it was as safe as in a walled city. A proof of this was the fact that he never made gates for any-city of Italy, and the gates already existing were not closed. Any one who had business to transact could do it as safely by night as by day." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_ItOstrg] "the great economic symptom of Theodoric's reign--and under the circumstances a most healthy symptom--was that Italy, from a corn-importing became a corn-exporting country."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_ItOstrg] Odovacar assassinated by Theodoric 493 CE after Church mediated peace treaty which gave "absolute equality of power" to both leaders.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_ItOstrg] Period ends with Justinian's Pragmatic Sanction after the Gothic War. "By 554 the Ostrogothic Kingdom was gone. A few Gothic garrisons held out in the north for almost seven years. Finally in 561, the garrisons at Verona and Brixia capitulated."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_ItOstrg][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Theoderic, who had emerged successfully from a power struggle between various competing groups of Goths and their leaders in the Balkans in the course of the 470s and 480s, had recently plundered Thrace and was at the time threatening Constantinope. For Zeno, dispatching Theoderic to fight Odovacer in Italy provided a way to deal with two problems at once. Theoderic entered Italy in 489 and prevailed over Odovacer after a period of intense warfare In 493, following a protacted siege of the capital Ravenna whence Odovacer had retreated, the two general agreed to share rule over Italy. Theoderic, however, murdered Odovacer shortly after entering the city (allegedly with his own hands) and had many of his followers killed. Thereafter, Theoderic's army, the exercitus Gothorum, proclaimed him king. Theoderic had been king of the Goths already since 474, and the renewed proclamation in 493 was probably meant to underline his claim to power over Italy and all of its inhabitants."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_ItOstrg][MAJIDBENAM_BR]After Byzantines under Justinian ended Ostrogothic rule he "ostentatiously reclaimed imperial prerogatives and the traditional markers of civilitas such as coinage, taxes, care for the annona, public buildings, and most importantly, legislative authority."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_ItOstrg]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ loose; unitary state ♥</b>Loose[MAJIDBENAM_BR] "Governing Ostrogoths was a constant struggle to pull the forces of villages and kindreds, nobles and their followers, farae and allied peoples into line behind the will of the monarch. Tradition strengthens the hands of the nobility, prolonged crisis those of the royalty. Under such circumstances, Rome usually held the initiative and the Goths reacted as best they could. Consistent and long-term policy was virtually impossible. Even on campaigns, the king was rarely able to control his own people except <i>in extremis</i> ... even Theodoric himself at Marcianopolis... Ermanaric created the Ostrogothic confederacy as a military structure to establish a broad regional control over the numerous groups in the area and then led it against the Huns. And in this way he endeared himself to generation after generation. ... The Hunnic episode raised an elite far above the masses. The Amalian line profited from Hunnic favor, but the basic problems of leadership remained."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_ItOstrg][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Unitary state[MAJIDBENAM_BR] "Once the Ostrogoths took over Italy from Odovacar ... In terms of government there was, of course, but one alternative - the late Roman imperial system. As a king of an allied people and as magister militum praesentalis, consul for 484, patrician, and Flavius, Theodoric saw his task as essentially the establishment of an adequate system of government over the Goths to refocus gradually their personal loyalty from him onto his agents and officers. Insofar as possible, he allowed the Roman bureaucratic state and its many departments to function as usual."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_ItOstrg][MAJIDBENAM_BR] "The Anonymous Valesianus reports that Theoderic 'made peace with the emperor Anastasius with regard to the presumption of the rule (presumptio regni) and Anastasius sent back to him all the ornaments of the palace, which Odovacer had transferred to Constantinople [in 476]'. This symbolic act of returning the ornamenta palatii in 498 signalled the acceptance of Theoderic's independent rule in the Italian provinces."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_ItOstrg]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ nominal allegiance; alliance ♥</b>Nominal allegiance to the Emperor in Constantinople[MAJIDBENAM_BR] "Thus then it came to pass that a formal interview was arranged between Emperor and King (perhaps at Constantinople, though it seems doubtful whether Theodoric could have safely trusted himself within its walls), and at this interview the terms of the joint enterprise were arranged, an enterprise to which Theodoric was to contribute all the effective strength and Zeno the glamour of Imperial legitimacy... If the Emperor would send Theodoric thither with his people, he would be at once relieved from the heavy charges of their stipendia which he was now bound to furnish, while Theodoric would hold the land as of the free gift of the Emperor, and would reign there as king, only till Zeno himself should arrive to claim the supremacy."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_ItOstrg][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Alliances with the Visigoths and others:[MAJIDBENAM_BR] "In the year 490 Gundobad, king of the Burgundians, crossed the Alps and descended into Italy to mingle in the fray as an antagonist of Theodoric. In the same year, probably at the same time, Alaric II., king of the Visigoths, entered Italy as his ally. A great battle was fought on the river Adda, ten miles east of Milan, in which Odovacar, who had emerged from the shelter of Ravenna, was again completely defeated. He fled once more to Ravenna, which he never again quitted."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_ItOstrg][MAJIDBENAM_BR] According to the Bishop of Ravenna, Theodoric: "He gave one of his daughters in marriage to the King of the Visigoths in Gaul, another to the son of the Burgundian King; his sister to the King of the Vandals, and his niece to the King of the Thuringians.

In 476 CE, a Roman military officer of likely Germanic decent (though his exact ancestry is not certain) named Odoacer led a revolt against the western emperor Romulus Augustus (r. 475-476 CE), a child whose rule was overseen by his father, a high-ranking general named Orestes. Odoacer and his fellow soldiers killed Orestes and effectively deposed Romulus Augustus, and Odoacer's authority was recognized by the Eastern Roman emperor at the time, Zeno, although he was not proclaimed Emperor in the West. In 480 CE, after the death of Julius Nepos, whom Zeno recognized as the legitimate Western Emperor, Zeno abolished the co-emperorship, claiming to rule over both halves of the Empire, although much of the Western Empire had already been lost and Italy itself remained under the control of Odoacer, who ruled as king.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_ItOstrg][MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_ItOstrg][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In 488 CE, the Eastern Roman Emperor Zeno convinced Theodoric, King of the Ostrogoths (r. 475-526), to invade Italy and remove Odoacer from power.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_ItOstrg] Theodoric and his Ostrogoths were successful, expelling Odoacer from Italy and establishing an Ostrogothic Kingdom over most of Italy, which lasted from 489 to 554 CE. Theodoric's agreement with Zeno, which may have been written down but no longer exists,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_ItOstrg] led Theodoric's rule to be officially recognized by the Eastern Empire in Constantinople.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_ItOstrg][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The period ends with Ostrogothic Italy's defeat at the hands of the Byzantine/Eastern Roman Emperor Justinian I in 455 CE. Justinian managed to reassert Roman rule and institutions over much of Italy, though this quickly evaporated in the face of invasions by Salvic, Turkic, and Germanic tribes. Only central and some parts of southern Italy remained under Byzantine authority into the later half of the 5th century CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_ItOstrg][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Ostrogothic Kingdom was essentially split between three separate power centres: Constantinople, Ravenna and Rome. The Ostrogothic king, traditionally elected by a Gothic military elite,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_ItOstrg] but made hereditary after Theodoric, made high-level administrative appointments to a court based in Ravenna and to the northern Italian cities of Pavia and Verona.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_ItOstrg] The Ostrogothic King was, however, in principle under the authority of the Byzantine/Eastern Roman Empire in Constantinople, on whose invitation Theodoric had invaded Odoacer's Italy. The emperors in Constantinople retained the right to name senators, consuls, and other high-ranking officials for the West,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_ItOstrg] while Rome remained an influential symbolic, economic, and ecclesiastical centre.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_ItOstrg] The Roman Senate at Rome functioned as a local governing centre;[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_ItOstrg] many wealthy Romans found traditional positions of authority and prestige in the administration at Ravenna.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_ItOstrg][MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_ItOstrg] Ostrogothic kings kept the existing late Roman governmental structure relatively unchanged,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_ItOstrg] but reduced in size[MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_ItOstrg] and more tightly centred on the royal court.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_ItOstrg][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The king's administrative and advisory council was made up of both Gothic and Roman officials.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_ItOstrg][MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_ItOstrg] This period also saw a 'blurring of the boundaries between civil and military functions'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_ItOstrg] The praetorian prefect was the most powerful individual in the kingdom below the king; he was responsible for enforcing the king's laws, had some power to issue his own edicts and set taxation rates, received the taxes from all provinces, paid military and administrative salaries, made personnel recommendations to the king and had the right of dismissal.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_42_ItOstrg] He also commanded the largest branches of the bureaucracy, was responsible for the public food supply, and was the final judge of appeal.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_43_ItOstrg][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Ostrogothic Kingdom reached a population of approximately 5.5 million people and witnessed a revival in economic fortunes for the region of Italy. Apart from the many Roman institutions, the Roman aristocracy and their privileges that were maintained, tax receipts were spent on public services[MAJIDBENAM_REF_44_ItOstrg] and Theodoric commanded that money be set aside for the restoration of walls and monuments in several Roman cities.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_45_ItOstrg] Theodoric also oversaw the construction of baths and an amphitheatre, and restored aqueducts from Ravenna to Rome - the latter had seen its population fall to around 100,000-200,000 inhabitants - and built churches such as the Arian Saint Theodor, the palatial San Apollinare Nuovo, and the San Andrea dei Gothi.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_46_ItOstrg]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Ostrogothic Kingdom ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Ostrogoths_500CE: 489CE-554CE ♥</b>  Ostrogoths_500CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_47_ItOstrg]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  549555: 489CE-554CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Italic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Latin ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Christianity ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Arianism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition ♣ Christianity ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religion Family ♣ Catholicism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religion Sect ♣ Roman Catholic ♥</b></div></body></html>
