They include: 1. A renewed "quest for new religious solutions which emphasized individual salvation. Generally, people were perhaps less optimistic that a virtuous life would bring them a blessed eternity, and more reliance was placed on the gods as a source of comfort. Traditional preparations for the afterlife continued, but people were also determined to enjoy their daily pleasures while they were still alive." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_EgSaite] 2. "Although weak and foreign dynasties tried to revive the myth of the god-king in order to support their royal status, the political power of the king continued to decline, along with his influence on religion." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_EgSaite] 3. An "increased association between the temples and lay people. One noticeable feature was an increase in the custom of setting up personal statues inside the temples so that the owners could benefit from the regular rituals for the gods (which were the same as those performed in earlier periods), and thus receive sustenance from the divine food offerings. It also emphasized the owner's devotion to the god, and gave him a claim on the deity's attention. This tradition emphasized the fact that the gods were now regarded as better guarantors of individual postmortem protection than the age-old mortuary cults." "One of the most characteristic developments of this later period is the importance of animal cults." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_EgSaite] 4. "One of the most characteristic developments of this later period is the importance of animal cults." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_EgSaite] Because it doesn't seem that these changes affected most of the variables we are interested in, it seems reasonable to infer continuity with earlier periods in terms of equality, prosociality, slavery, human sacrifice, and morality. Indeed, the the first millennium BCE was characterised by a "deep-rooted revival of things past that affected many aspects of Egypt's court culture, religion, script, literature, art, architecture, and burial practices."

The Saite kings, from their palace at Memphis,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_EgSaite] gradually managed to construct a considerably more centralized state than that of the preceding period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_EgSaite] The high point of Saite power was the reign of Amasis II, whose administration commanded sufficient revenues to enable him to build a fleet to conquer Cyprus.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_EgSaite] An important phenomenon of this period was the development of the Demotic script (from the Greek word <i>demos</i>, 'the people'), which originated in the delta but spread throughout Lower and Upper Egypt under Psamtik I and his successors.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_EgSaite] Based on Hieratic, a cursive script using simplified Egyptian hieroglyphics, Demotic was useful in everyday contexts such as accounting, letter-writing and non-religious literature, which grew in importance during the period.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Upper Egypt, which before the Kushites had long been ruled by a militarized priesthood, was always a difficult nut for the central administration in the Nile Delta to crack. At first, the main influence the Saites had over the Twenty-fifth Dynasty aristocracy at Thebes was through the priestly position of the God's Wife of Amun. This was held by a Saite priestess at the Amun temple, and an observer (<i>rsw</i>) based in Thebes who was often called 'governor'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_EgSaite][MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_EgSaite] Established in the Kushite Period, the God's Wife of Amun role was of 'very great and publicly acknowledged' political importance.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_EgSaite][MAJIDBENAM_BR]To increase their hold over Egypt, Saite strategy, under the first ruler Psamtik I, sought the removal of the nome system of administration; instead a military official was directly appointed to oversee the whole Southern Land (covering the region from Aswan to Memphis).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_EgSaite] Named leader of the fleet and based in Herakleopolis, this official also acted as the 'revenue accountant for Middle and Upper Egypt'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_EgSaite] The Saite king ruled from Memphis, where there was a High Council of aristocrats who reported directly to him.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_EgSaite] The vizier acted as the supreme judge of the realm.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_EgSaite] In the Late Period, almost all officials were also priests[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_EgSaite] and oracles featured in the elections of officials and even of kings.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_EgSaite] The military was usually led by the supreme chief of the expedition,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_EgSaite] but under Amasis II the chief physician also occupied important military roles such as 'leader of the Aegean foreign (troops)' and 'admiral of the royal fleet'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_EgSaite][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Theban Egypt was not brought under the effective control of the Memphite kings until Psamtik II's campaign against the Kingdom of Napata between 592 and 591, which ended what had essentially been a 'period of compromise' in Upper Egypt.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_EgSaite] Before that time, Saite authority was so weak that they were forced to acknowledge the legitimacy of the Kushite pharaohs of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty. After Psamtik II's military successes of the 590s, however, their policies changed and they began to portray the Nubian kings as usurpers.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_EgSaite] With the Saite Dynasty now in a more powerful position, there was a return to the nome system of provincial organization, with governors once again stationed in the regions.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_EgSaite] The title of leader of the fleet seems to disappear around this time,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_EgSaite] and by 592 BCE Herakleopolis had a 'governor'.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Unfortunately, again, reliable population estimates at this time are difficult to find, but every indication suggests that the total population remained fairly steady at roughly three million people.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_EgSaite]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Egypt Saite Period ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Egypt26th_600BCE: 664BCE-525BCE ♥</b>  Egypt26th_600BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_EgSaite]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  510431: 664BCE-525BCE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Afro-Asiatic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Egyptian-Coptic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Demotic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Ancient Egyptian Religion ♥</b></div></body></html>
