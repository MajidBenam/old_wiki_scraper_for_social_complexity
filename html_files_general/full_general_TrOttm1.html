Breakdown was a "struggle for power between the Turkish notables and their descendants, who wanted to restore the gazi tradition and the primacy of the High Islamic institutions of the Seljuks, and the survivors of the kapikullars and the Christian advisors, who proposed opposite policies... As Bayezit's sons fought for power, they gained support of one or another of these groups, with the alliances changing rapidly as the groups changed their estimates of which prince had the best chance of leading them to victory."

The Largest and longest lived was the emirate of Karaman in south-central Anatolia, with the old Seljuk capital of Konya as its principal city. In western Anatolia, Byzantine rule did not survive Turkish immigration of the late thirteenth century, and by 1300 Turkish rule had replaced Greek with several Turkish principalities on the former Byzantine territory. In the former Byzantine province of Bithynia was the emirate of Osman, the founder of the Ottoman dynasty whose lands would form the nucleus of the Ottoman Empire.

The Mevlevi Order, founded by the son of the 13th century poet Rumi, was the order of Ottoman intellectuals and attracted poets, musicians, and calligraphers. The order established convents or hostels (tekke) in various Ottoman cities and these served as centers for the teaching of art and music as well as being places of spiritual retreat. The Bektaşi Order, by contrast, was the order of the Janissaries and its traditions were oral rather than literary. Although many of its practices were unorthodox, such as the drinking of wine, it too received official recognition from the sultans as a way of keeping the troops happy. The sultans and their families supported both orders financially by establishing some of their convents and bestowing lavish gifts on the orders’ sheikhs."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_TrOttm1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Genus ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion ♣ ♥</b>The polity of the Ottomans was originally one of many small Turkish principalities on the border of the Byzantine realm[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_TrOttm1] against whom their ghazi chieftain launched raids for territory and plunder. Through both warfare and diplomacy with farmers, townspeople and Christian nobles, they eventually forced the submission of the western Balkans and then annexed their rival Turkish principalities in western Anatolia.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_TrOttm1] The massive expansion of the Ottoman polity (18,000 km2 in 1320 CE to 690,000 km2 by 1400 CE) came to an abrupt halt with the invasion of Timur in 1402 CE who conquered the Ottomans and made its ruler a vassal. There was then a civil war for control of the Ottoman state which ends the first period (1290-1402 CE).[MAJIDBENAM_BR]As the polity rapidly expanded, the Ottoman government was run out of a succession of capitals: Sogut (1299-1325 CE), Bursa (1326-1364 CE), and Adrianople (1364-1413 CE) all provided a base for a period. The title of Sultan was introduced in 1383 CE by Murat I (1362-1389 CE). His government was an extension of his court and the top officials were directly appointed, and increasingly powerful through the period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_TrOttm1] An Imperial Council (divan)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_TrOttm1] issued his decrees and made less important and administrative policy decisions.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_TrOttm1] Viziers in the government were able to make some appointments in the name of the Sultan at the very least by the fifteenth century.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_TrOttm1] The date when the Grand Vizier became the most powerful official in the state is disputed; some scholars believe this occurred c1360 CE[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_TrOttm1] while Ottoman tradition has it when Mehmed II stopped attending meetings in early 15th century.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_TrOttm1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Provinces with governors probably did not exist until the 1380s CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_TrOttm1] The rapid increase in size of the Ottoman state meant that the winner of the Ottoman civil war would gain control of territory that held 5 million people.</div></body></html>
