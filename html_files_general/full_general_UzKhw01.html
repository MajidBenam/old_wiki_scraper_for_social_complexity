The idea of a pre-500 BCE 'Great Khwarazm Empire' with influence over Sogdiana and other regions, mentioned briefly in Frederick Starr's book, doesn't appear to be common among scholars of Iron Age Central Asia.</span>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Francfort writes that the Middle Iron Age (c. 1000-560 BCE) in Central Asia is one of the most poorly understood when compared to other prehistoric periods. He sees no reason to qualify older historians descriptions of it as a dark age ('âge sombre').[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_UzKhw01] However, what we can see is the architecture that emerged during the period in Khwarazm and elsewhere: 'Dans le nord de l'Afghanistan et en Ouzbékistan surgissent de vastes établissements que leurs occupants munissent de puissants remparts: Merv, Samarkand, Kyzyl Tepé, Bandykhan Tepé, Altyn Dilyar, et d'autres sont de véritables villes fortifiées, souvent de forme circulaire.

This was a second, large-scale urbanization that equally affected Khwarazm (Kalaly-Gyr)].[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_UzKhw01][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"On arrival in the fertile lands of Khorezm the steppe tribes entered into interaction with the farming population - representative of the indigenous culture of Suyargan."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_UzKhw01][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"According to  S. P. Tolstov and M. A. Itina (1960), the Tazabagyab Culture coexisted in Khorezm with the Suyargan Culture. This culture appeared in the first half of the second millennium B.C., developing out of the local Kelteminar Culture (Gulyamov et al. 1966), which was influenced by southern farmers. In the latter half of the second millennium B.C., the Suyargan and Tazabagyab populations were in the process of active assimilation."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_UzKhw01][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Tazabagyab culture 15th-11th centuries BCE: "The legitimacy of distinguishing the sites of Khorezm as a particular Tazabagyab culture is borne out by the statistically stable combination of characteristics marking it off from the Timber-grave and Andronovo cultures."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_UzKhw01][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Amirabad culture continues on from Tazabagyab: in the first third of the 1st millennium BCE, 'in the lower reaches of the Amu Darya [i.e. Khwarazm], we have the Amirabad culture, which continues to a great extent the traditions of Tazabagyaba. The settlements consisted of large-frame houses of the semi-mud hut type; hand-molded dishes are occasionally decorated with notches. The wide distribution of domesticated horses is significant.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_UzKhw01][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Discussing finds from Koktepe in Sogdiana (to the east of Khwarazm), Rapin and Isamiddinov refer to 'la civilisation qui, du Turkménistan au Xinjiang, s'étend dans la période de transition entre l'âge du bronze et l'âge du fer, du dernier tiers du IIe millénaire au début du Ier millénaire av. n. è.'

Before the arrival of Iranian peoples in Central Asia, Sogdiana had already experienced at least two urban  phases.  The first was at Sarazm (4th-3rd m. BCE), a town of some 100 hectares has been excavated, where both irrigation agriculture and metallurgy were practiced (Isakov).  It has been possible to demonstrate the magnitude of links with the civilization of the Oxus as well as with more distant regions, such as Baluchistan.  The second phase began in at least the 15th century BCE at Kök Tepe, on the Bulungur canal north of the Zarafšān River, where the earliest archeological material appears to go back to the Bronze Age, and which persisted throughout the Iron Age, until the arrival from the north of the Iranian-speaking populations that were to become the Sogdian group.  It declined with the rise of Samarkand (Rapin, 2007).  Pre-Achaemenid Sogdiana is recalled in the Younger Avesta (chap. 1 of the Vidēvdād, q.v.) under the name Gava and said to be inhabited by the Sogdians.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_UzKhw01][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The most interesting Early Iron Age culture of ancient Khorezm was that of Amirabad in the tenth to eighth centuries b.c.2 Dozens more settlements were found in the lower reaches of the former channels of Akcha Darya, the ancient delta of the Amu Darya. The most interesting was Yakka-Parsan II, alongside which were found ancient fields, and the remnants of an Amirabad-period irrigation system (Fig. 1). The old channel passed near by, its banks being reinforced with dykes.Two rows of semi-dugout houses - some twenty in all - were found in the Yakka-Parsan II settlement. Large numbers of storage pits were found around the houses, and the entire site is rich in animal bones, pottery, grain-querns and so on. The houses stood between two canals that merged to the south, all the doors giving on to the canals. Rectangular in ground-plan, the houses were 90 to 110 m2 in area and had two or three rooms. The interiors contained many storage pits and post-holes, each with a long fireplace in the centre. The major finds were pottery, hand-made with a darkish brown, red or greyish slip, the shoulders of the bowls being decorated with small crosses, lattice-work or 'fir-trees'. Accord ing to S. P. Tolstov, the Amirabad culture was genetically akin to the Kaundy complex and dates from the ninth to eighth centuries b.c. It should be observed that the pottery shows more obvious traces of Karasuk influence, the commonest shapes being similar to the ceramics ofthe latter; this entitles us to date its origins to a somewhat earlier period - the tenth century b.c. Other finds include bronze artefacts - a needle with an eye, a sickle with a shaped handle, a bronze arrow¬ head with a shaft - and stone moulds for casting shaft-hole arrowheads and sickles. A bronze sickle, large numbers of grain-querns and the advanced irrigation network and fields together show that agriculture was widely practised, while the bone finds further indicate that the population was engaged in stock- breeding.3" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_UzKhw01][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The Achaemenids found in Sogdiana an urban civilization. Along two divergent canals fed by the Zarafshan, the proto-Dargom and the Bulungur, two gigantic sites, Afrasiab-Samarkand and Kök Tepe - each covering more than two hundred hectares - were occupied from the 8th or 7th century before our era.2 The valley of the Zarafshan had already known an earlier urban phase at the site of Sarazm, a small distance upstream from Samarkand, but this phase had ended a millenium before.3 Kök Tepe declined rapidly, but Samarkand became for two millenia the greatest city of Sogdiana, and, with Merv and Bactra, one of the very great cities of western Central Asia. The Achaemenids brought writing to Sogdiana, and the written language long remained the Aramaic of the Achaemenid Empire." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_UzKhw01][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The 6th and 5th cenuries BC are represented by only a few monuments, and the nature of Persian political and economic control over Chorasmia is,, therefore, still in question. Similarly unresolved is the question of the introduction of large-scale irrigation to the area - whether this was an indigenous development, gradually evolving as the cattle-breeding nomadic tribes became sedentised, or whether it was a new technology introduced by an hydraulic imperial state, the Achaemenid Empire under Darius I, in about 525 BC. Up until last year only three large-scale settlements of this period were properly documented - i.e. Kiuzeli-g'ir, Kakal'i-g'ir, and Chirik-rabat."

Isakov, “Sarazm: An Agricultural Center of Ancient Sogdiana,” Bulletin of the Asia Institute 8, 1996, pp. 1-13.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]'The process of urbanization began earlier and on a greater scale in Chorasmia and on the left bank of the middle Syr Darya, localities which were more advanced in economic and cultural terms. They were geographically closer to the ancient urban centres of south-western and southern Central Asia and were open to their influence through Margiana and Sogdiana. They were later incorporated as provinces of the Achaemenid Empire and came into its socio-economic orbit for a time. In the southern Aral region, the sedentary farmers and pastoralists of the Chorasmian oasis represent the Late Bronze Age Amirabad cultural pattern seen in the Dzhanbas and Yakka-Parsan settlements. At that time they had master craftsmen (the 'house of the caster') with settled houses and social gradations. [...] The oldest Chorasmian city, and the key monument of this period, was Kyuzeli-gir, dating from the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. It lay on the left bank of the Amu Darya in the Sarîkamîsh region of the delta. Standing on a natural elevation, roughly triangular in ground-plan, it occupied an area of 25 ha. The city was surrounded by a powerful defensive wall with oval bastions. Its residential district was densely packed with buildings of rectangular unbaked brick and pakhsa. It had an advanced pottery industry, based on the wheel, and art objects of a type common in Saka burial complexes of the period have been found. Another early city of the same date, Kalalî-gîr, was surrounded by triple walls with bastions and had four gates with entrance barbicans and a hill-top palace, but it was never completed.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_UzKhw01][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Throughout the periods Helms and Yagodin focus on in their 1997 article (from the end of the Bronze Age to the incursions of the Hephthalites, Turks and early 'Afrighids' in the mid-1st millennium CE), 'the region saw the infiltration of many nomadic groups (initially cattle-breeders, later also sheep-goat and camel) some of which formed settled communities, even states and empires. These are the Scythians (a generic term), Massagetae, Sacae, Sav[u]romats, Yueh-chih (later "Kushans"), Sarmatians, and others of the Greek, Persian, and Chinese sources. Identifying evidence of their presence has never been easy: the bulk of data has had to come from burials (kurgans) whose contents have been loosely arranged in a relative chronology (see Itina 1979). Recent work by Yagodin has provided more precise information regarding tribal groupings in and about ancient Chorasmia, including the Ustiurt Plateau, as early as the "Archaic" period (Yagodin 1990) and, more generally, the major trade routes (i.e., the Silk Road) through northern Central Asia (Yagodin 1994)'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_UzKhw01]</div></body></html>
