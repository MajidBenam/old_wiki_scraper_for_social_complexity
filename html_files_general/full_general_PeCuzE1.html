[...] numerous chiefdoms had developed across the region. The largest and most powerful of these were located in the areas of greatest agricultural production, including the Plain of Anta, the Cuzco Basin, the Lucre Basin and the Huaro Basin. Elsewhere, smaller chiefdoms also developed. Depending on their locations, these were most likely in a constant state of conflict or alliance formation with the large polities of the region."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_PeCuzE1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ PeCuzLF ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b>  Although Bauer and McEwan propose different names for the cultures of the Cuzco Valley and Chanapata can either designate a previous polity, or the polity preceding the Wari, there is a sense of continuity for the polities of the Cuzco Valley before the arrival of the Wari. "In the Cuzco region at this time, there was a culture called Chanapata by archaeologists. The Chanapata peoples are little known and in many respects seem to be a continuation of the preceding Marcavalle culture."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_PeCuzE1][MAJIDBENAM_BR][MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_PeCuzE1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Early Intermediate Period of Andean history lasted from 400 BCE to 550 CE,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_PeCuzE1] and is known for the emergence of regional forms of political organization, such as the Moche in northern Peru (100-800 CE) and the Nazca in the Rio Grande de Nazca and Ica regions (100 BC-800 CE). In the Cuzco Valley, this period saw the development of numerous chiefdoms of varying sizes.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_PeCuzE1] One of these polities is known as Qotakalli (200-500 CE),[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_PeCuzE1] and may have controlled an area of up to 1000 square kilometres.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_PeCuzE1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The period also saw a change in settlement patterns. Wimpillay no longer dominated the valley, as several new large sites grew in the west of the basin, with a possible large settlement under the modern city of Cusco.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_PeCuzE1] New settlements grew along the lower valley slopes below 3500 metres above sea level, which archaeologist Brian Bauer interprets as evidence for population growth and a possible shift in the valley's economy towards maize production.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_PeCuzE1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the Lucre Basin further to the east, the Chanapata culture still flourished in the form of small farming villages until 600 CE: Chanapata ceramics were found in the lowest strata during excavations at the site of Choquepukio.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_PeCuzE1] These polities may have centred around the sites of Choquepukio and Mama Qolda.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_PeCuzE1] Furthermore, the presence of Pucara ceramics and early Tiwanaku-related wares indicate possible contacts between the Cuzco Valley polities and the Titicaca cultural sphere, perhaps through trade, but not through political assimilation.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_PeCuzE1][MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_PeCuzE1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Although the population of the region during this period is currently impossible to determine, it is worth mentioning that 16 Qotakalli sites with an area of between 1 and 5 hectares have been surveyed, as well as 35 sites between 0.25 and 1 hectares,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_PeCuzE1] suggesting a possible two-tiered settlement pattern.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_PeCuzE1] The density of sites near modern Cuzco may indicate various groups of elite households interacting with each other within the Qotakalli chiefdom.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_PeCuzE1]</div></body></html>
