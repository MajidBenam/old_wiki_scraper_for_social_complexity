[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_GrCrMPa] The beginning of this era is marked by the destruction of most Minoan sites and and its end by the destruction of the Knossian palace, seat of a political authority controlling the greatest part of the island.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣polity♥</b> Two different narratives have been proposed based on archaeological data and epigraphy. Bennet argued that Crete, except the east region of the island,  was divided into a series of provinces, hierarchy organized, and centered upon Knossos. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_GrCrMPa] Driessen suggested that  the Knossian satellites acted more as local extractions nodes. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_GrCrMPa].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b>It is very likely that the ruling Knossian elite was in contact with the powerful dynasties of mainland Greece.

To use the worlds of M. Popham "Close control over much of the island was being exercised, in part throughout a centralized bureaucracy which recorded contributions in produce, flocks of animals, localized labour forces, manufactured goods and stores of military equipment and their owners, the last indicating the build-up of considerable part in weapons and chariotry. Perhaps it was fear of this potential threat which led some other powerful state  to extinguish the danger and to pillage and burn the Palace at Knossos along with its surrounding mansions."

The use of Linear B script in the Knossian administration suggest that the elite segment of the polity was familiar with the archaic version of Greek. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_GrCrMPa]</div><div class='meatypart'></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b>  Minoan. Early Greek belongs to the Indo-European language family.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Crete is a large island in the Eastern Mediterranean. Here we consider the phase of its history best known as the Monopalatial Era. This period began following the destruction of many Minoan sites around 1450, due either to natural catastrophes or human agency[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_GrCrMPa][MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_GrCrMPa], and it ended with the destruction of Knossos[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_GrCrMPa] Throughout this period, Knossos was the main political, administrative and economic centre of the island: analyses of both textual and archaeological data shows that Knossos controlled a series of second-order (e.g. Kydonia and Phaistos) and third-order (e.g. Tylissos) centers[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_GrCrMPa][MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_GrCrMPa]. However, a resurgence of elite display at second-order sites, starting in 1370, suggests a possible power shift in the final decades of this era, and the decline of Knossian influence over the island[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_GrCrMPa].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and Political Organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The supreme leader of the state was the king, known as <i>wanax</i>[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_GrCrMPa] He presided over the political, economic and religious  hierarchy. It is not certain, however, whether he had any  military or judicial duties. Ranked second was the <i>lawagetas</i>,  a military leader. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_GrCrMPa] Below these leaders were the <i>hequetai,</i> followers,  who accompanied military contingents and may also performed other functions. Other officials, the so-called collectors, were involved in acquiring and distributing exchange commodities. Among the figures at a lower level were the <i>qasireu</i> who served as overseer of group of workers -the predecessor of the word known from ancient Greek as the word for the king (baseless) - the <i>telestas</i> , officials, the <i>korete</i> and <i>porokorete</i>, mayor and vice-mayor, and scribes[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_GrCrMPa].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Firth estimates that, at this time, Crete numbered 110,000 inhabitants[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_GrCrMPa].</div></body></html>
