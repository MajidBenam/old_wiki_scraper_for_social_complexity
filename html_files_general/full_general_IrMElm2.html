Three phases have been distinguished, each marked by a different dynasty named after its founder or most significant early leader (thus the Kidinuids, Igihalkids and Shutrukids). This is the period when the title 'king of Susa and Anshan', as it is expressed in Akkadian texts, or 'king of Anshan and Susa'. according to the usage of the Elamite sources, is attested."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_IrMElm2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Peak Date ♣ 1300 BCE ♥</b> "The 'golden age' of the united federal Elam was toward the end of the second millennium B.C., when, after a period of decline, the empire enjoyed a renaissance of power and achievement in arts and architectures; one of the federated states, Kassite, conquered and ruled Babylonia for 567 years, and Elam expanded to almost all of Mesopotamia and Asia Minor"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_IrMElm2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"At the same time as the rise of the Middle Assyrian state, the Middle Elamite state grew under Humban-nimena, Untash-Humban, Unpater-Humban and Kidin-Hutran. Internally, the most influential Elamite king was Untash-Humban, who founded the city of Dur-Untash (Choga Zanbil, south-east of Susa). Dur-Untash was a small city, but certainly an important religious centre, with a ziqqurat that could have been completed with the Babylonian ones and a rich set of temples and public buildings ... Therefore, Elam was clearly influenced by the tendencies of the time ... founding royal residences and artificial capitals ex novo."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_IrMElm2] -- <i>c1350 BCE</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]reign date?[MAJIDBENAM_BR] "the reign of Untash-Humban constituted the apogee of the Middle Elamite period."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_IrMElm2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 1399-1200 BCE ♥</b> Middle Elamite II (1400-1200 BCE)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Ike-Halke - founder of the new Elamite dynasty.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_IrMElm2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]1420 BCE - Knowledge of the beginning of the Middle Elamite Kingdom is limited. Names of probable kings are known from the fifteenth and fourteenth centuries but there is no defined point between the intermediate period and the start of the Middle Elamite Kingdom. 1420 CE is chosen as a representative starting point, rather than the date of a particular event. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_IrMElm2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]1100 BCE - The Middle Elamite Kingdom ended when the Babylonian army, led by Nebuchadnezzar, defeated the last Middle Elamite king, Hutelutush-Inshushinak and seized Susa. Nebuchadrnessar reported in a letter that Huteleutush-Inshushinak disappeared, but bricks bearing his name found at Tal-i Malyan give some credence to the suggestion that he retreated to Anshan after defeat. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_IrMElm2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"In the mid-fourteenth century BC, Kurigalzu II defeated the Elamite king Hurba-tilla. However, the latter does not appear in the Elamite dynastic sequences. Therefore, it is possible to assume that he was a king of Susiana with a Hurrian name, and that this defeat and Kurigalzu's expedition to Susa did not threaten the stability of the Elamite confederation."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_IrMElm2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ unitary state ♥</b> It is known that kings appointed regional governors. The title King of Anshan and Susa infers greater centralised control of Elam than in previous and later periods, but it is likely that there were periods when there was greater regional power. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_IrMElm2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Without exaggeration, the Elamite federated system of government can be considered as perhaps the earliest formal federalism on a large scale in history."

In this period it became embroiled in Mesopotamian politics and became part of the supraculture of Mesopotamia. At the same time Elamite kings held the title of king of Anshan and Susa.

Susa ceased to be the political centre of Elam. The seat of power moved further inland, beyond the mountains, in Anshan (modern Fars). Consequently, Middle Elamite kings began to use the title of 'king of Anshan and Susa.'"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_IrMElm2] Which period does this quote refer to?: "The kings used two capitals: one in the lowland city of present Dizful and the other in Susa"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_IrMElm2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Reacting against Mesopotamian cultural influence, an Elamite dynasty of the fourteenth century restored Anshan (henceforth called Anzan in inscriptions) to a kind of theoretical preeminence. Around 1340, with a view to assuring the cohesion of his empire, Untash-Napirisha, the fifth king of the dynasty, founded a new royal center that later bore his name, Al Untash-Napirisha (modern Chogha Zanbil), twenty-five miles southeast of Susa ... This new foundation ... was built around a great national temple complex called the siyan-kuk, or 'holy place.' Originally the complex, dedicated solely to the patron god of Susa, Inshushinak, consisted essentially of a building resembling a secular caravanserai, with an open court surrounded by rooms, and containing two small sanctuaries. Cult ceremonies probably took place in the courtyard in the open air, as had been the custom in the high places of the mountain peoples outside the great urban centers."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_IrMElm2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Elamite; Akkadian ♥</b> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_IrMElm2]  After mid-14th BCE: "The official language (also for royal inscriptions) was once again Elamite, and not Babylonian, as it had been before the dark age."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_IrMElm2] "The Elamite written language was used as the official language in the bureaucracy for a long time, rivaling the Sumerian and Akkadian languages even over a thousand years later, during the Old Persian Empire of the Achaemenids."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_IrMElm2]</div><div class='meatypart'></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ none ♥</b> "Elamite is a language which belongs to no kno wn language family" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_IrMElm2][MAJIDBENAM_BR][MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_IrMElm2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Middle Elamite kingdom, about 250,000 square kilometers, was located in what is now Southwestern Iran. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_IrMElm2] The kingdom is commonly split into three phases: the first before 1400 BCE; the second, 1400-1200 BCE, which was characterised by intermarriage with the Kassites; and the third, 1200-1100 BCE, characterised by war with the Kassites.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The First Period lacks the evidence of the later periods, but can be seen to be a substantial state, where the kings held the title of king of Anshan and Susa, even if it is not clear how much control they exerted over Anshan. The kings of the First Period had local governors and diplomats, craft and cult organisation, and could wage war against the Babylonians. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_IrMElm2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Second Period has a comparative wealth of evidence, mostly royal inscriptions from building or dedicatory texts. During this period, the empire expanded and many building works were undertaken, including the construction of the new city al-Untash Napirisha. This period also saw the Elamites becoming increasingly involved in Mesopotamian politics. There were many marriages between Elamite princes (the Igihalkids) and Kassite princesses. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_IrMElm2] The "Berlin letter", an important text, names four marriages between Elamite princes and Kassite princesses. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_IrMElm2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Third Period involved military battles with Babylon, which had been annexed by Assyria. in 1158 BCE, the Elamite king Shutruk-Nahhunte invaded Babylonia and overthrew the Kassite king Zababa-shuma-iddina, probably giving the throne to his son Kutir-Nahhunte. The Middle Elamite Kingdom ended when the Babylonian army, led by Nebuchadnezzar, defeated the last Middle Elamite king, Hutelutush-Inshushinak and seized Susa in revenge for taking their god and invading their kingdom. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_IrMElm2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Kings of this period were commonly referred to by the title 'king of Susa and Anshan' in Akkadian and 'king of Anshan and Susa' in Elamite.  It is a period characterised by this unity between the highlands, Anshan, and the lowlands, Susa. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_IrMElm2] A powerful bureaucracy had religious and secular influence in the government. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_IrMElm2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The population for the entire empire is unknown, but the largest settlement is estimated at between 1,500-6,000 people during the early period, 2,750-11,000 people in 1300 BCE, and 5,000-20,000 in 1200 BCE.</div></body></html>
