[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_TrCappL] The polity gradually fell into other hands, and was fought over by the more prominent powers in Asia Minor, Pontus and Bithynia, as well as the Roman Empire to the west [MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_TrCappL] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_TrCappL]. Cappadocia was in a good strategic position for all of these polities to either extend their own states or to buffer the territory they already had. The end of the rule of the Ariarathid dynasty came in the 90s BCE, although the exact dates are unknown. At this time, the kingdoms of Pontus and Bithynia were fighting over Cappadocia (and murdering or marrying those in the Cappadocian ruling family to gain a footing), until Rome declared the ‘freedom’ of Cappadocia. From then on, Cappadocia was ruled by Ariobarzanes, by the grace of Rome, and was eventually to be annexed by Rome [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_TrCappL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_TrCappL]. The end dates correspond to the end of the Ariarathid dynasty (c. 95 BCE) and then to the end of the rule of Archelaus (17 CE)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_TrCappL].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The rulers of Cappadocia: [MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_TrCappL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_TrCappL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_TrCappL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Datames (c. 380-362 BCE)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Ariamnes I (362-350 BCE)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Mithrobuzanes (died 334 BCE)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Ariarathes I (350-331 BCE)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Ariarathes I (331-322 BCE)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Ariarathes II (301-280 BCE)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Ariaramnes (c. 275-225 BCE)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Ariarathes III (c. 225-220 BCE)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Ariarathes IV Eusebes (220-163 BCE)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Ariarathes V Eusebes Philopator (163-130 BCE)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Orophernes (157 BCE)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Ariarathes VI Epiphanes Philopator (130-116 BCE)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Ariarathes VII Philometor (116-101 BCE)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Ariarathes VIII (101-96 BCE)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Ariarathes IX (c.95 BCE)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Ariobarzanes I Philoromaios (95-63 BCE)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Ariobarzanes II Philopator (c. 63-51 BCE)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Ariobarzanes III Eusebes Philoromaios (52-42 BCE)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Ariarathes X Eusebes Philadelphos (42-36 BCE)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Archelaus (36 BCE - 17 CE)</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ nominal; unitary state; loose ♥</b> 380-331 BCE: nominal; {331 BCE; 301 BCE}-96 BCE: unitary state; 99 BCE - 17 CE: loose <i>dates are not machine readable yet - ET</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Cappadocian rulers paid nominal allegiance to the Achaemenid Empire before it collapsed in 331 BCE [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_TrCappL]. After Alexander’s conquest of Asia Minor, Ariarathes I established himself as the first king of Cappadocia (a region largely left alone by Alexander) and ruled from 331 - 322 BCE. There was, however, some disagreement with Rome after Ariarathes I and the dynasty only continued when his son, Ariarathes II, regained the throne from the Roman Eumenes in 301 BCE. The Ariarathid dynasty then ruled until the 90s BCE, and ruled as the head of all state and religious affairs.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The last Ariarathes (IX Eusebes) was the son of the Pontic king Mithridates VI Eupator, who was ousted by the Roman Senate and eventually replaced by the elected Ariobarzanes I [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_TrCappL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_TrCappL].  Ariobarzanes I, II, III and Ariarathes X then ruled Cappadocia from 95 - 36 BCE and maintained friendship with Rome during that time, leading up to Cappadocia becoming a province of the Roman Empire in AD 17.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ nominal allegiance; alliance; personal union; vassalage ♥</b>  {380-331 BCE: nominal allegiance}; 331-95 BCE: alliance, personal union; {95 BCE - 17 CE}: vassalage[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The kings of Cappadocia maintained their position in through alliances with the neighbouring powers, including Rome, Bithynia, Pergamon, Pontus and the Seleucid Empire [MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_TrCappL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_TrCappL]. Marriage arrangements were made between the royal dynasties of some of these polities (most importantly the Seleucid empire and the Pontic kingdom) [MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_TrCappL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_TrCappL]. The alliances were however, often short-lived and either followed or were followed by aggressive relations between the two polities. Before 322 BCE, Ariarathes I (the ruler of Cappadocia) may have nominally been under the authority of the Achaemenid Persian Empire; and after the brief rule of Ariarathes IX Cappadocia effectively became a Roman province and was ruled by Ariobarzanes (I, II and III) in ‘friendly’ relations with Rome. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_TrCappL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_TrCappL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]It should also be noted that even when the kingdom of Cappadocia was ruled by independent kings as a unitary state, Rome still exerted influence on Cappadocian politics. Twice, when there was internal feuding between claimants to the Cappadocian throne, Rome intervened and either declared the kingdom split between the monarchs or freed from the monarchy altogether. This happened after the dispute between the brothers Ariarathes V and Orophernes in 159/8 BCE [MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_TrCappL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_TrCappL]; and between Ariarathes IX (Mithridates VI Eupator of Pontus’ son) and the claimant put forward by Nicomedes, king of Bithynia around 97 BCE [MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_TrCappL].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Seleucid Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Late Roman Republic  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b> km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Mazaca-Eusebeia; Mazaca ♥</b> {Mazaca; Ariaratheia; Mazaca-Eusebeia} Mazaca, or Mazaca-Eusebeia, was the main capital of Cappadocia(Sherwin-White, 1984, p40), although Araiathes II attempted to build another capital named after himself (Ariaratheia) which “sank into oblivion” (Rostovteff, p839)</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Greek ♥</b> "Cappadocia is another example of a kingdom which adopted Greek as the language of administration, and whose kings energetically sponsored cultural Hellenism (high literary culture, gymnasion culture; euergetism abroad), to gain acceptance in the international scene."

The kingdom grew out of suzerainty to the Achaemenid Empire when Alexander the Great toppled the Achaemenids and largely bypassed Cappadocia [MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_TrCappL], but the kingdom eventually returned to being a province under the next greatest power, Rome, in the early first century CE. Even during the peak reign of Cappadocian kings, the polity was fought over and used by the kings of its neighbouring polities to strengthen their positions of power or to buffer their state against the ambitions of another. This happened to such an extent that Mithridates VI Eupator, king of Pontus, placed both his nephew and son on the Cappadocian throne, only to kill the first to reinforce the claim of the latter, much to the antagonism of Nicomedes III, king of Bithynia at the time, who claimed his own right to a puppet on the Cappadocian throne. The incident resulted in the intervention of Rome who declared the ‘freedom’ of Cappadocia from monarchs (in theory) so that neither the kingdoms of Pontus or Bithynia could use Cappadocia for their own gains. The kingdom was then ruled by kings favoured by the Roman Senate until the death of Archelaus who was the last king of Cappadocia, places there by Antony.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]As a result of Cappadocia’s relatively minor position during this time, very little textual (or other) direct evidence from the kingdom has survived. Numismatic evidence does give some detailed information about the chronology of kings, but even this is debated [MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_TrCappL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_TrCappL]. Instead, much of what is known about the kingdom of Cappadocia comes from accounts of the foreign policy of its neighbours, particularly Rome at the time. The main historian who discussed Cappadocia was Strabo, and his accounts lack the detailed information on Cappadocia which other polities have [MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_TrCappL].</div></body></html>
