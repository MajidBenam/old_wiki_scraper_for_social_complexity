Together this coalition was responsible for the fall of the second Turkic empire." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_MnUigur] "Uighur political organization was relatively centralized, with several levels of administration, including a system of tax collection. Still, a leader often served dual civil and military functions. Some evidence indicates that local leaders were relatively autonomous and that royal edicts were not always the law of the land (Mackerras 1990, p. 328)."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_MnUigur] "Like the Türks before them, the Uighurs ruled in a virtual symbiosis with the Sogdian merchants of Bukhara and Samarqand. Their attitude toward the Chinese, how- ever, was very different from the Türk rulers’ usually hostile stance. Facing a much weaker China, the Uighur rulers treated the Tang as a protectorate. In return for fighting rebels and Tibetans, the Uighurs expected vast sums of silk, as much as 230,000 bolts in a single year, and imperial princesses. Although the Uighurs also traded horses and presented “tribute goods” at the same time, the Tang found Uighur assistance very expensive, while Uighur troops were often as destructive as the rebels they were fighting."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_MnUigur] "The Toquz Oghuz formed an important but turbulent subject population for the two TÜRK EMPIRES (552-630, 682-742). In 742, in cooperation with the Basmil near the Tianshan Mountains, and the QARLUQS in Zungharia, the Uighurs overthrew the second Türk Empire. Three years later the Uighurs drove out the Basmil and elevated Qulligh Boyla as the Qutlugh Bilge Kül Qaghan (744-47), establishing their capital, ORDU-BALIGH, in the ORKHON- RIVER-TAMIR region that had been the Türk Empire’s sacred center." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_MnUigur] "The first Uighur rulers considered themselves continuers of the Türk tradition, and claimed legitimacy by linking themselves with Bumin Kaghan, the founder of the First Türk empire. The difference separating Türks from Uighurs must have been purely political. As is clearly shown by the inscriptions commemorating the deeds of their great men, Türks and Uighurs spoke the same language, used the same runic-type script and lived within the same geographic boundaries. Were it not for their name, the Uighurs would be indistinguishable from the Türks."

The most famous is the huge capital city of Ordu Balik (Khar Balgas), currently being excavated by a Mongolian-German project. It is estimated that the city encompassed a walled area of 25 km2 (Kiselev 1957; Radloff 1892; Rogers et al. 2005). In A.D. 821 the traveler Tam ̄ın ibn Bahr visited the city and described it as agriculturally rich with many outlying villages (Minorsky 1947, p. 283)."

Were it not for their name, the Uighurs would be indistinguishable from the Türks." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_MnUigur] "The Türks spoke a dialect of Old Turkish belonging to the Oghuz family, close to modern Uighur, Uzbek, Türkmen, and Turkish, somewhat more distant from the Qipchaq family of Kazakh and Tatar, and quite far from the Oghur family of Chuvash and Old Bulghar. Although many other tribes also spoke close or identical dialects, the Türks’ imperial prestige gave a single name to the whole family of dialects."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_MnUigur] "Uighur culture changed dramatically with Bayan-Chor’s forced conversion of his people to Manicheism. Manichean doctrines required strict vegetarianism of the elect priests, including the renunciation of KOUMISS. Bogu exhorted his people to “let [the country] with barbarous customs and smoking blood change into one where people can eat vegetables; and let the state where men kill be transformed into a kingdom where good works are encouraged.” By 821 the Arab visitor Tamim bin Bahr at the capital, Ordu-Baligh, found the city’s population primarily Manichean. Manicheism also adapted to Uighur life; Manichean hymns, for example, incorporated the Turk-Uighur reverence for otuken." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_MnUigur] "However, there is no evidence or reason to believe that conversion ever advanced far beyond the Uygur ruler and segments of his family, clan, entourage, and administration during the steppe empire. On the contrary, opposition to the new religion could have been one of the factors in the palace coup that resulted in the execution of Bugu Khan and his Sogdian advisers in 779, since Manichaeans also suffered grievously in the purge. 29 Although Manichaeism was restored to an official status under the rulers Ay Tangrite ulug Bulmis Alp Kutlug Ulug Bilga Khagan/Huai-hsin (795- 808) and Ay Tangrite Kut Bulmis Alp Bilga Khagan/Pao-i (808- 821), it surely served as one of the ideologies of the leadership and not as a belief system that integrated secular and religious life for the peoples of the realm."
