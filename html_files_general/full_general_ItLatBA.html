However, it is worth noting that most sites of this period cluster along the Apennine mountain range; for this reason, Italian Bronze Age culture is sometimes referred to as 'Apennine culture' (<i>cultura appenninica</i>).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_ItLatBA] In the Late Bronze Age, the main cultural traditions were the Subapennine (12th century BCE, <i>subappenninica</i>) and the Proto-Villanovan (11th and 10th centuries BCE, <i>protovillanoviana</i>)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_ItLatBA] These traditions brought greater sophistication in agricultural techniques, a greater number and variety of agricultural tools, and advances in metalworking.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_ItLatBA][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]It is difficult to infer much about the political organization of the average Italian settlement, either in the Middle or in the Late Bronze Age. There are very few signs of status differentiation, whether in burials, architecture, or material culture more generally.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_ItLatBA][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Population was probably sparse up to the Middle Bronze Age in Italy, with settlements of no more than a few dozen inhabitants each. In contrast, the Late Bronze Age witnessed a significant demographic increase, suggested by an increased number of sites and increased site size. Settlements were probably home to a few hundred inhabitants.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_ItLatBA]</div></body></html>
