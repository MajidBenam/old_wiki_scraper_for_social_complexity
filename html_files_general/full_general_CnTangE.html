Through the Chinese living through the troubled and disturbed decades which followed his abdication, his reign represented a golden age of departed glories, an era of good government, peace and prosperity, equally successful at home and abroad."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_CnTangE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Reign of Li Shimin (Taizong) 627-649 CE was "the zenith of the T'ang dynasty... More than a century of internal peace followed Tai-tsung's reign..."  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_CnTangE] However the zenith of the T'ang dynasty might not mean the same thing as the zenith of the T'ang dynasty's polity.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]During reign of Xuanzong (712-756 CE) "the Empire seemed - at least outwardly - to be more prosperous and stable than ever before. The increase in population was steady ... The wealth of the country was obvious ... and 'one could undertake a voyage within the empire for a distance of 10,000 li without being armed'. Thus, it seemed that the T'ang had reached a new pinnacle of glory. This is especially true if the period were to be regarded from the point of view of the arts, for it was precisely in this era that the greatest flourishing of T'ang culture took place."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_CnTangE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Xuanzong (712-756 CE): "it was not he who ruled during the latter period from about 740 but his Chancellor Li Lin fu (in office 736-752), who established himself an unchallenged master of the Empire."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_CnTangE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 617-763 CE ♥</b>"In 617, when it was obvious that the Sui were finished, Li Yuan marched on Ch'ang-an with an army of 200,000 which included many Turkish auxiliaries. In the subsequent year Li Yuan proclaimed himself Emperor of the T'ang (Kao-tsu 618-626)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_CnTangE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The policies established at the outset of the T'ang era were followed, in general, during the long reign of T'ai-tsung's successor, Kao-tsung (650-683)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_CnTangE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"In 712 Jui-tsung resigned in favour of his son who was to become the famous Emperor Hsuan-tsung (712-756). His long and eventful reign marks, in fact, a turning-point in the development of China and in the fate of the T'ang dynasty..." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_CnTangE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"In a long and costly campaign the T'ang succeeded in crushing the rebellion by 763. An Lu-shan himself had been killed earlier, in 757, by his own son. The son was, in turn, slain by Shih Ssu-ming who was then commander of all the rebel armies. Shih Ssu-ming, whose military ability was undoubted, suffered an identical fate and was subsequently murdered by his own son. Although ultimately defeated, the An Lu-shan rebellion revealed fully all the inherent weaknesses of the T'ang government. In effect, it broke its power, and while the dynasty lasted almost another century and a half it never recovered fully, in spite of the attempts made by some of the subsequent T'ang rulers, as for example Emperor Hsien-tsung (806-820), to restore a strong, centralized monarchy."

Their policy, however, differed in one very important respect from that of the Han: the establishment of semi-independent princedoms was not permitted and the entire country was ruled as one state and empire."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_CnTangE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Sui Dynasty ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuation ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Later Tang Dynasty ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ China ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣ [5,000,000-6,000,000] ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Chang'an ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Chinese ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Sino-Tibetan ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Genus ♣ Chinese State Religion ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Family ♣ Imperial Confucian Traditions ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Genus ♣ Buddhism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Family ♣ Chinese Buddhist Traditions ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Genus#2 ♣ Daoist Traditions ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Family#2 ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion#2 ♣ ♥</b>"Map 11. T'ang China 742 CE." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_CnTangE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Tang Dynasty is widely considered a cultural and political high point of imperial China. The dynasty was founded by Li Yuan, the Duke of Tang, when the threat of insurrection forced the previous Sui dynasty court to flee from Luoyang, the capital, to Yangzhou. Li Yuan marched to Luoyang and seized the abandoned capital in 618 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_CnTangE] He became the first emperor of the Tang dynasty (r. 618-626 CE) and is posthumously known as Gaozu. Under the Early Tang Dynasty, the capital was moved from Chang'an to Luoyang.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_CnTangE] We divide the Dynasty into an Early period (618-763 CE) and Late period (763-907 CE), separated by the decline in imperial authority and instability of experienced by the Tang in the 750s, culminating in the An Lushan rebellion to close out the Early period (755‒763 CE).[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Under Early Tang leadership, China's territory expanded considerably. Conquered territories included large areas of Central Asia and northern Korea (Koguryō).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_CnTangE] In later years, however, China pursued a defensive, non-expansionist policy towards groups on the steppe and frontier.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_CnTangE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The dynasty, also known as the Tang (T'ang) Empire or Li Dynasty, is famous for its poetry, literature, increased trade and general cosmopolitanism.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_CnTangE] In 660 CE, Empress Wu became the first woman to rule China, first governing as a regent to her young son and later ruling as empress dowager and regent until her death in 705 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_CnTangE] Emperor Xuanzong's 44-year reign (712‒756 CE) ushered in a cultural and economic golden age, which declined as he aged and ended in rebellion and an overthrow of the dynasty.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_CnTangE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Emperor Gaozu worked to restore control of the imperial government that had been established by the Sui Dynasty, and founded frontier garrisons controlled directly by the capital.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_CnTangE] The Tang instituted the much discussed 'equal fields' system, in which land owned by the state was parcelled out in equal allotments to citizens in return for taxation. The Tang also minted many new coins in an attempt to stabilize the economy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_CnTangE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Early Tang imperial government was characterized by an emperor who theoretically had absolute power, but was often in practice overruled by ministers or regents.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_CnTangE] The central government was headed by three chief ministers who ran the Imperial Chancellery, Imperial Secretariat, and the Department for State Affairs.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_CnTangE] The government also included a large central and state bureaucracy, marked by the expanding use of merit examinations.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_CnTangE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The population of the Early Tang Dynasty is estimated at 37 million in 700 CE and increased to almost 53 million by 754 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_CnTangE] In the 8th century, there were an estimated 1 million people living in Chang'an.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_CnTangE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Tang Dynasty ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Tang_600CE: 617CE-699CE; Tang_700CE: 700CE-763CE ♥</b>  Tang_600CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_CnTangE] Tang_700CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_CnTangE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  2983900: 617CE-699CE;  4204756: 700CE-763CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Sino-Tibetan ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Sinitic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Old Chinese ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Confucianism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Imperial Confucianism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition ♣ Buddhism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religion Family ♣ Chinese Buddhism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition2 ♣ Daoism ♥</b></div></body></html>
