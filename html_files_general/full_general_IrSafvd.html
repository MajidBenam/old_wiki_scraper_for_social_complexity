[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_IrSafvd] Under Abbas I "military, political and economic stability."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_IrSafvd][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Iran’s role in the silk trade led to the forging of important diplomatic relations with European powers. The death of Abbas is usually seen as the beginning of the slow decline of Safavid rule; certainly by the end of the 17th century they were no longer a great military force and their administration had stagnated.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_IrSafvd]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 1501-1722 CE ♥</b> Note: Secondary literature dates the start of the polity a year earlier than we do. 1501 is the year Ismāil defeated the Āq Qoyunlu and proclaimed himself Shah. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_IrSafvd]  The end date is the same 1722 when the Afghans forced Solṭān-Ḥosayn to surrender to them. He gave the title of shah to the Afghan leader Maḥmud Ḡilzay.

In 1501, the Safavid army broke the power of the Āq Qoyunlu by defeating their ruler, Alvand (r. 1497 in Diārbakr [q.v.], and then in Azerbaijan until 1502, d. 1504), in the Battle of Šarur, in the Aras valley." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_IrSafvd]  Core region: Anatolia and Azarbaijan: "A once parochial and religiously ambiguous millenarian movement that had depended heavily on the nomadic elements of the Anatolian and Azarbaijani environments now inherited the dynastic infrastructures of two well-established empires (the Aq Qoyunlus and Timurids) and annexed cities and territories from equally centralized polities, such as the Ottomans and the Mamluks."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_IrSafvd]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ elite migration; continuity ♥</b> The Safavids drove out the Āq Qoyunlu from Persia with the help of Qezelbāš tribal forces. They installed themselves as Shahs, princes etc and Qezelbāš were given regional governorships. They declared the new regime to be Shi'i and the existing Sunni population was "persecuted, driven out, or killed". [MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_IrSafvd] Evidence for this is material cultural e.g. new coins minted and texts such as chronologies. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_IrSafvd] "the Safavids were themselves the posterity of the Aq Qoyunlu, not only in a genealogical sense, but also as heirs to a tribally constituted military elite". [MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_IrSafvd] Ismail began from a power base in the Caspian region, before moving into western Persia and Azerbaijan after defeating the the Āq Qoyunlu.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_IrSafvd]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣  ♥</b> Solṭān-Ḥosayn surrendered to the Afghans and gave the title of shah to their leader Maḥmud Ḡilzay.

This Universalist emphasis was in part inherited from the Turco-Mongol world of the Fourteen and Fifteenth centuries, but we also cannot dismiss the importance of those Universalist empires and world conquerors of the Archaemenian and Sasanian eras represented so faithfully as exemplars in Perso-Islamic literature and art."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_IrSafvd] "The 'Shi'fication' and Iraniation' of the Safavid Empire over a period of a hundred years prepared the landscape for a regional split into distinct Sunni Ottoman and Shi'i Safavid dominions."

Source: wiki commons.</b>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Safavid period of rule in Persia (1501-1722 CE) was begun by Shah Ismail (1501-1524 CE) and is known as a 'gunpowder empire' due to the now widespread use of artillery and muskets on the battlefield.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_IrSafvd][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Shah Ismail, whose original power base was near the Caspian sea, began the conquest of Iran with the capture Tabriz from the Ak Koyunlu. He declared that the state religion was Shi'ia and the Safavids were decisive for the spread of Shi'ism in Iran.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]While initially the governing system was "largely a continuation of its Aq Qoyunlu counterpart and its Turco-Mongolian traditions"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_IrSafvd] it eventually became a "highly cen­tralized and complex bureaucratic system"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_IrSafvd] based at the Safavid court in the capital city.  The highest officials of the Safavid court included the Vazir-e-azam (chief minister), Amir al-omard (commander in chief of the army, later titled Sepdhsdldr-e koll-e lasgar-e Iran), the Sadr (judiciary and religious minister), and vice-regent. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_IrSafvd][MAJIDBENAM_BR]As a defensive measure against Ottoman attacks Shah Tahmasp (1524-1576) moved the capital from Tabriz to Qazvin, but Shah Abbas I (1587-1629 CE) moved it again, further south, to a new monumental city at Isfahan. Under Shah Abbas Isfahan’s population grew to 200,000.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_IrSafvd] The rule of Shah Abbas I (1587-1629 CE) is widely thought of as representing the peak Safavid achievement. Incredible wealth acquired from the state monopoly over the silk trade, was spent on large-scale building works. Abbas also made key reforms to improve the administration and the army.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_IrSafvd][MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_IrSafvd] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_IrSafvd]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Safavid Emirate ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ SafavidEmirate_1500CE: 1501CE-1599CE; SafavidEmirate_1600CE: 1600CE-1699CE; SafavidEmirate_1700CE: 1700CE-1722CE ♥</b>  SafavidEmirate_1500CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_IrSafvd] SafavidEmirate_1600CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_IrSafvd] SafavidEmirate_1700CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_IrSafvd]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  205461: 1501CE-1599CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Indo-Iranian ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Middle-Modern Persian ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Islam ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Shia Islam ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Sect ♣ Twelver ♥</b></div></body></html>
