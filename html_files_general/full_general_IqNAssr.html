Sharrukin was important between 707-705 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Despite the constantly moving king and capital the Assyrian government put down literary roots in a state archives[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_IqNAssr] and perhaps the world’s first organized library was built at Nineveh under Asurbanipal (668-627 BCE). Here scribes copied texts from a 1,000 year old Babylonian literary tradition. These included medical works, mythologies, religious guides and astrology.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_IqNAssr] The high level of sophistication the Assyrian civilization achieved is reflected in ruins of water reservoirs and sewerage systems[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_IqNAssr], an aqueduct built in Nineveh[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_IqNAssr] and "traditional Mesopotamian mud-brick architecture ... monumental stone sculptures and wall reliefs."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_IqNAssr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Assyrian government was the personal project of the king who appointed all officials at the state, regional and local levels as well as the priesthood.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_IqNAssr] He was advised by officials called Magnates.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_IqNAssr] The king's provincial governors also lived in palaces[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_IqNAssr] and were initially direct relations of the king until the reign of Shalmaneser III (r.859-824 BC) who instead made governors directly appointed eunuchs.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_IqNAssr] Historians believe governors had a lot of freedom over the day-to-day running of the regions since letters that have been recovered sent from governors to the king primarily concern unforeseeable problems.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_IqNAssr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the 7th Century population of Mesopotamia reached its height of about 2 million. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_IqNAssr] At its height, after Egypt was conquered in 671 CE, combined with south-eastern Anatolia, the Levant region and western Iran, the total population of the tribute-paying empire may have reached 7 million people.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_IqNAssr]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Neo-Assyrian Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Neo_Assyria_900BCE: 911BCE-801BCE; Neo_Assyria_800BCE: 800BCE-701BCE; Neo_Assyria_700BCE: 700BCE-612BCE ♥</b>  Neo_Assyria_700BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_IqNAssr] Neo_Assyria_800BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_IqNAssr] Neo_Assyria_900BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_IqNAssr]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  125759: 911BCE-801BCE;  310292: 800BCE-701BCE;  609413: 700BCE-612BCE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Afro-Asiatic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Semitic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Aramaic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Ancient Anatolian Religion ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Assyrian Religion ♥</b></div></body></html>
