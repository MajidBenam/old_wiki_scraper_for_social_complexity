During his reign prosperity spread throughout his empire and an era of wealth began to be established.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_MlSong2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Songhai height in the 16th century [MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_MlSong2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Askia Daud (r.1549-1582 CE) "was widely praised for memorizing the Quran and for supporting learning and religion.

Rulers converted to Islam  - perhaps influenced by Berber traders - beginning 11th century, possibly 1010 CE, and then capital transferred to Gao.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_MlSong2] Gao was a centre for trans-Saharan trade even before 1000 CE and had been a state well before the establishment of the Songhai empire.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_MlSong2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"In methods of government, it seems that the new Songhay leadership mainly took over the old Malian system, and this tendency became clearer when, soon after the death of Sonni Ali, power was seized by one of his generals, the Askiya Muhammad Ture, whose name would strongly suggest that he was not of Songhay but of Soninke (i.e., northern Mande) origin, and that his coup d'etat represented a return to Mande leadership in what was predominantly a Mande-speaking empire."

These kings consolidated Songhay power by building on the legacy of their Malinke predecessors and took control of more territories, extending their reach over the Niger Inland Delta, westward to the Atlantic ocean, northward to the salt pans of Taghaza, and eastward to the Tuareg kingdom of Agadez.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_MlSong2][MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_MlSong2][MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_MlSong2] However, the empire was brought to an abrupt end in the late 16th century: after a succession crisis which sparked a civil war, the Sultan of Morocco invaded in 1591.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_MlSong2][MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_MlSong2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Unlike the preceding Ghana and Mali Empires, Songhay operated as a centralized unitary state.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_MlSong2] The king was a revered figure but his authority was tempered by the precepts of Islam from the 11th century, and this religion became increasingly prevalent under the Askiya dynasty.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_MlSong2] The imperial council coordinated the activities of the central government, which was divided into ministries including those of agriculture, finance, the army and the naval fleet.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_MlSong2] The two major provinces, Kurmina in the west and Dendi in the southeast, were ruled by princes who were responsible for their own armies.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_MlSong2] Thriving trading towns like Jenné, Timbuktu, Teghazza and Walata enjoyed a certain degree of autonomy due to the power of guilds and local chiefs, but had to report to a superintendent, tax inspectors, customs officials and other state appointees.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_MlSong2] Vassal and tributary countries also bowed before the power of the Askiya when disputes arose.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_MlSong2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Songhay empire is associated with the establishment of high centres of learning in Jenné, Dia, Gao and Timbuktu. The latter in particular was famed for its university, holy men, doctors and teachers, who contributed to the spread of Islamic humanism among the urban elite in the region from the 15th century.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_MlSong2] The rural Songhay continued to venerate a pantheon of divinities and local spirits until Islam penetrated the countryside via the peaceful incursions of traders and government-sponsored marabouts.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_MlSong2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]It is difficult to find substantiated population estimates for the Songhay Empire, but one scholar believes there could have been 70,000 people living in the city of Timbuktu by 1580 under Askiya Daoud.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_MlSong2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Songhai Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Songhay_1500CE: 1493CE-1591CE ♥</b>  Songhay_1500CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_MlSong2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  799004: 1493CE-1591CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Songhay ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Songhay ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Songhay ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Islam ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Sunni Islam ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition ♣ Sahel Religion ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religion Family ♣ Songhai Religion ♥</b></div></body></html>
