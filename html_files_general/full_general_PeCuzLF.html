The association of finer craft production with the largest village of a basin to serve the demands of a developing elite class is frequently observed in the archaeological record. It lends support to the unique importance that Wimpillay may have held among the Late Formative Phase sites of the basin." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_PeCuzLF][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"On the basis of these findings, it can be suggested that the production of Chanapata and related ceramics started around 500-300 BC and continued until after the turn of the first millennium AD."

This cluster is made all the more notable by the fact that there are no Formative Period sites in the high watershed area between the Cachimayu area and the Cuzco Basin. These sites most likely represent a small village cluster that paid allegiance to the elites of Cuzco or a similar chiefly society developing in or near the Plain of Anta, further to the west." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_PeCuzLF]Bauer also refers to the existence of "important villages near the modern towns of Yaurisque and Paruro", in the Cusichaca area, in Chit'apampa and the Cuyo Basin, and a chiefdom in the Lucre Basin. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_PeCuzLF] "Since periods of chiefdom developmment are frequently marked by conflict as many roughly equal polities compete for dominance, it is possible that additional research in the Cuzco region will not only help us to better define the political divisions of the area, but will also bring forth evidence of conflict and alliance formations between the many different chiefly centers."

Traditionally, it has been subdivided into three periods. The Early Formative (2200-1500 BCE) corresponds to the beginning of ceramic production and quinoa cultivation and the establishment of large, permanent villages.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_PeCuzLF] During the Middle Formative (1500-500 BCE), Marcavalle ceramics appeared and villages grew, possibly leading to the beginnings of ranked village societies.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_PeCuzLF] The domestication of camelids was also under way.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_PeCuzLF] The Late Formative (500 BCE-200 CE) saw the emergence of a three-tiered settlement pattern in the Cuzco and Oropesa basins, dominated by the settlement of Wimpillay.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_PeCuzLF] This period is also known as Chanapata, in reference to a dominant ceramic style discovered in the 1940s.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_PeCuzLF] It is possible that other small chiefdoms existed in the region: a few early villages have been found near Raqchi in the Chit'apampa Basin,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_PeCuzLF] and there may have been some small independent polities near Paruro and Cusichaca.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_PeCuzLF] In the Lucre Basin to the east of modern Cuzco, a small chiefdom may have centred around the site of Choquepukio.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_PeCuzLF][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The population of these early polities remains unknown, but over 80 archaeological sites dating to this period have been surveyed in the valley by archaeologist Brian Bauer.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_PeCuzLF] Some of these were identified as hamlets and small villages, with between a few dozen and a few hundred inhabitants.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_PeCuzLF] More research is needed in order to understand sociopolitical relations at the time, but Bauer has interpreted the Late Formative as the period in which chiefdoms begin to emerge.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_PeCuzLF] This process continued and solidified in the Early Intermediate Period.</div></body></html>
