'The new surveys show that, at its peak (about ad 1100-1300), Angkor was probably the world’s most extensive low-density city, covering 1,000 square kilometres and with half a million or more inhabitants.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_KhAngkC] 'The temple of Angkor Wat was built during the height of Cambodian political power, during the reign of King Suyavarman II (r. 1113-ca. 1150).'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_KhAngkC] 'Angkor under Suyavarman [II] was at the peak of its glory. The institutional reforms of Rajendravarman were secure, giving a measure of centralisation to the administration of the empire.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_KhAngkC] 'The history of the Khmer empire from its vague and possibility fictitious beginnings in the centres of Funan and Chen-la to its apogee from the eleventh to the thirteenth centuries, and decline thereafter, is beyond the scope of this present work.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_KhAngkC] 'An analysis, albeit not universally accepted, of the Great Lake in Cambodia argues that in Angkor’s heyday, c. 1000-1300, it held considerably more water than in later periods.52'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_KhAngkC] 'Angkorean power reached its greatest height during the reign of Jayavarman VII (r. 1181-c. 1218). His capital was Angkor, at the centre of which was Bayon, a huge pyramidical temple and one of more than 900 Buddhist temples built by Khmer rulers from the 9th century onwards.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_KhAngkC]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 1100-1220 CE ♥</b>This period begins in 1100 because that is the year that is approximately the year that a new dynasty (the Mahīdharapura, originally from the Khorat area) began under Jayavarman VI.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]This period ends in 1220 CE (death of Jayavarman VII).[MAJIDBENAM_BR]'Despite the control of the means of destruction by the overlord through his army and war elephants, a steady flow of goods from the countryside was essential. It is possible that the excessive demands of Jayavarman VII, and the spread of Hinayana Buddhism, which stresses the importance of the individual, undermined that relationship. Certainly, the building activity declined after the death of Jayavarman, and the central grip of provinces which formerly deferred to Angkor, slackened. But Angkor was not alone: the Chams to the east represented a potent force, as did the vibrant Thai state centred at Ayutthaya. When the latter invested and sacked Angkor, they removed a competitor, but maintained the traditions of kingship expressed in the rituals and esoteric language that a Loubere was to encounter at the court of King Narai.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_KhAngkC] 'The last Sanskrit inscription carved in Angkor commemorates the ascension of a minor king. Archaeologists consider this the end of the Classic Khmer period.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_KhAngkC] 'Cambodian history is normally divided into the pre-Angkor (third century to 802 CE), Angkor (802-1432), and post-Angkor periods. The pre-Angkor period is mainly known from seventh-century inscriptions; Angkor epigraphy begins in the late ninth century. Thus there is a crucial gap in our sources during the critical transitional phase.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_KhAngkC] 'Harsavarman III ascended the throne of Angkor in 1066. According to inscriptions from Mi Son, the Cham defeated him in a battle at Somesvara and devastated Sambhupura (Sambor), taking captives to serve in sanctuaries of Sri Isanabhadresvara in Mi Son. Harsavarman died in 1080 and received the posthumous name Sadasivapada. It seems that upon his death, a power struggle broke out. A ruler named Nripatindravarman may have ruled at Angkor until around 1113, whereas another ruler named Jayavarman VI is also mentioned in one unfinished inscription at Angkor, and in later inscriptions. No kinship relationships among any of these individuals can be ascertained.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_KhAngkC]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ unitary state ♥</b> 'All the institutions of government reviewed above give the impression that they belong to an apparatus of (as least potentially) oppressive, even totalitarian, power. Indeed, it is altogether likely that after the time of Rajendravarman the kings of Angkor presided over a much more centralized regime than the Khmers had known before. Institutions of government embodied no principles of constitutional checks upon royal power beyond the notion of religious morality. An impulse to totalitarian government was present, and found expression whenever rulers found themselves temporarily without dangerous rivals still at large. We must remember, though, that this tate lacked all the advantages of modern communications and technology to assert its control in detail, and that all sorts of regional, personal and factional loyalties were liable to obstruct the impulse to totalitarianism before too long.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_KhAngkC] 'Angkor under Suyavarman [II] was at the peak of its glory. The institutional reforms of Rajendravarman were secure, giving a measure of centralisation to the administration of the empire.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_KhAngkC] 'The central administration in Angkor must have had fairly detailed information for the purposes of taxation and core labour of all the empire's inhabitants, for according to Zhou a census was taken during the ninth Cambodian month, where everyone (or, more likely, all heads of families) was called to the capital, and passed in review before the Royal Palace. Such census registers were kept in Aymonier's day, and revised every three years.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_KhAngkC] 'Because the Angkor kingdom commanded a significant army and a large centralized administrative apparatus and because thousands of workers were needed to build and maintain its enormous building complexes, it has been assumed that around the stone constructions of the palaces and temples a city with a substantial population must have existed.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_KhAngkC] 'All such leaders were tied to the overlord by webs of family, marriage, and patronage whose instability ensured constant fluctuations in the center’s territorial influence. Reliable royal control in the sense of resource exaction was therefore confined to the capital zone, which normally included the empire’s most populous districts but which might not exceed a 60-mile radius. In Pagan, Angkor, and to a lesser extent perhaps early Champa and Dai Viet, temples and monasteries served simultaneously as agencies of agricultural reclamation, ritual validation, and intra-elite alliance. Because these wealthy, self-regulating religious institutions helped to stabilize labor and to concentrate resources, they tended to compress and, in some ways, to obviate royal administration. Nonetheless, the ruler remained indispensable as ritual intermediary between kingdom and cosmos, as military leader, and as coordinator of temple as well as secular patronage. Thus, while accepting that these were weak forms of the genus, we can still recognize charter-era entities as “states” according to Charles Tilly’s minimalist definition: “coercion- wielding organizations that are distinct from households and kinship groups and exercise clear priority in some respects over all other orga- nizations within substantial territories.”45'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_KhAngkC]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥</b> Although Sūryavarman I formed alliances with Champa and China against Annam as did other leaders, these alliances were not long-standing or enshrined by inter-marriage.

Jacques argues that there is no proof that Mahidharapura is around this site (Jacques and Lafond 2004:301). Both Jayavaraman VI and his successor, Dharanindravarman I, appear to have maintained their control away from Angkor [i.e. Yasodharapura].' However, 'Suryavarman II took the throne in 1113 CE, returning the focus to Angkor as the centre of the Khmer political world' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_KhAngkC]. 'Early Angkor, in the eighth and early ninth centuries, consisted of two centers: one around Ak Yum dating from the seventh century, under what is now the western end of the West Baray; and the other, Hariharalaya, from the eighth century, at what is now called Roulos in Southeast Angkor. Both enters were unbounded and apparently low-density settlements (Pottier 2006). [...] In the late ninth century, the centre was moved to Phnom Bakheng and the East Baray built. This capital, named Yasodharapura, was also unbounded (Pottier 2000) and incorporated both Hariharalya and Ak Yum to form Greater Angkor. Thereafter until the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries, the locations of administrative enters and palaces moved around within the network of the urban complex. Only in the late twelfth century, with the construction of the walled and moated central enclosure of Angkor Thom, did the practice of relocating the administrative centre cease. Thereafter, the Bayon, the central temple of Angkor Thom, also became the permanent state temple at Angkor'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_KhAngkC] 'Circa 928 Jayavarman IV rules from Koh Ker, wehre he has estates some 50 miles northeast of Angkor. There he builds a new urban center, with his palace, a baray, and a stepped pyramid temple to Shiva. 944 Rajendravarman II returns the capital to Angkor. The name “Angkor,” from the Sanskrit word for “city,” was given to the capital only in the 16th century. Temple inscriptions during imperial times call it Yashodharapura, “glory—bearing city.”'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_KhAngkC] 'The Khmer pronunciation of Sanskrit negara, signifying capital of a kingdom.

Archaeological remains have shown that they inhabited the area of the Mekong Delta and Tonle Sap regions of present- day Cambodia, northeast Thailand, and around the Gulf of Thailand from at least the beginning of the Common Era (C.E.). Perhaps they date even earlier, as evidence of an Austro-Asiatic group has been found in western Thailand in Kanchanaburi Province near the village of Ban Kao, dating from Neolithic times (10,000 B.C.E.). Archaeological remains indicate that a Mon civilization based on Theravada Buddhism was present in northeast Thailand up to around the early ninth century, when it was overtaken by the Khmers of Angkor expanding from cen- tral Cambodia at the beginning of the reign of Jayavarman II (770/790/802?-834 C.E.).'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_KhAngkC] 'In northeast Thailand, for example, most Hinayana Buddhist stupas yielded to the standardized prasat structures of Angkorian Hinduism or Mahayana Buddhism.58 In 1200 people who spoke Khmer as their primary tongue probably formed a majority in the Cambodian plain, the Mekong basin as far north as That Phanom, much of the Chi and Mun river valleys, and the area im- mediately north and east of present-day Bangkok.59 But the lowlands also contained very substantial non-Khmer populations. Those parts of the Chaophraya basin subject to Angkor, for example, were dominated by Mon- and later by Tai-speakers, both of whom tended to be more attached to Hinayana Buddhism than to Hinduism. The basin also included people who in later times might be labeled Malay, Cham, or Karen.60 Angkor itself by 1297, according to Zhou Daguan, had Siamese (Tai) settlers as well as a large population of enslaved hill peoples, who were treated as a race apart.
