It was in this area, now part of Livingston and Ontario counties and the southern portion of Monroe County, that the Senecas built the various villages they occupied from at least the early sixteenth century until the American Revolution. Their hunting territory was considerably larger. It extended north to Lake Ontario, south to the headwaters of the lesser Finger Lakes, and east to the highlands between Seneca and Cayuga lakes (“The League of the Iroquois: Its History, Politics, and Ritual,” fig. 1, this vol.) (Fenton 1940:225). After the Iroquois had defeated the other Iroquoian speakers who lived in the area--Eries, Neutrals, and Hurons--the Senecas extended their hunting territories to the west, ranging into Ohio and southern Ontario, and established some small settlements in these regions notably at Niagara.'

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_UsIroqE] The individual member nations were represented in a common leage council: 'The Seneca ([unknown] sen[unknown] ku, locally also[unknown] sen[unknown] k[unknown] ), westernmost of the Iroquois tribes, were the largest in the Confederacy. Their numbers were often reported to be almost equal to or to exceed those of the other four Iroquois tribes combined (“The League of the Iroquois: Its History, Politics, and Ritual,” table 1, this vol.). Nevertheless, of all the Iroquois tribes they had the fewest number of chiefs on the League council; they held eight such chieftainships.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_UsIroqE] The Iroquois Confederacy was effective in dealing with external enemies until the American revolution, but individual nations also enjoyed considerable agency in handling their own affairs: 'The Iroquois Confederacy differed from other American Indian confederacies in the northeastern woodlands primarily in being better organized, more consciously defined, and more effective. The Iroquois used elaborately ritualized systems for choosing leaders and making important decisions. They persuaded colonial governments to use these rituals in their joint negotiations, and they fostered a tradition of political sagacity based on ceremonial sanction rather than on the occasional outstanding individual leader. Because the league lacked administrative control, the nations did not always act in unison; but spectacular successes in warfare compensated for this and were possible because of security at home.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_UsIroqE] The Confederacy was therefore an alliance of independent nations rather than a confederate state: 'Thus the League of the Iroquois was an alliance conceived among aboriginal nations which, though culturally related and speaking languages fundamentally similar but differing in vocabulary and idiom, had recurrently been in conflict. The league brought them out of conflict into peace. Then came the French, the Dutch, and the English, and the doom of the league was sealed, its desired results nullified. Here was an alliance binding together five distinct nations, based upon an orally transmitted constitution. It had no inscribed statutes, no taxes or levies, no gendarmerie, no hireling politicians. We hear, however, of tribute exacted of subjugated tribes. Tribute, as the Iroquois took it, consisted of stipulated sums of wampum demanded of the Algonkian tribes on the Atlantic Coast who produced it; and wampum was not an item of money, cash, or currency in native economy before the coming of Europeans to the Hudson Valley. Its function was that of a symbol, valuable in a spiritual sense and capable of serving the purposes of mnemonic record making. Thus the wampum tribute we read so much about would seem to be a measure pressed upon subjugated smaller tribes in the shell-bearing coastal regions, requiring them to furnish the wampum the Iroquois needed in the score of ceremonial uses they had developed for it.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_UsIroqE] 'During the 15th and early 16th centuries, warfare in the Northeast culture area fostered the creation of extensive political and military alliances. It is generally believed that this period of increasing conflict was instigated by internal events rather than by contact with Europeans; some scholars suggest that the region was nearing its carrying capacity. Two of the major alliances in the area were the Huron confederacy (which included the Wendat alliance) and the Five Tribes (later Six Tribes), or Iroquois Confederacy. The constituent tribes of both blocs spoke Iroquoian languages; the term “Iroquoian” is used to refer generally to the groups speaking such languages, while references to the “Iroquois” generally imply the tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy alone.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_UsIroqE] 'The Five Tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy lived south of the St. Lawrence River and Lake Erie, for the most part in the present-day state of New York. The alliance comprised the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca peoples; the Tuscarora joined the confederacy later. Evenly matched with the Huron alliance in terms of aggregate size, the Iroquois were more loosely united and somewhat less densely settled across the landscape. While the Huron nations traded extensively for food, this was less the case for the Five Tribes, who relied more thoroughly upon agriculture. Before colonization they seem to have removed southward, perhaps in response to raids from the Huron to their north. The alliances among the Five Tribes were initiated not only for defense but also to regulate the blood feuds that were common in the region. By replacing retributory raids among themselves with a blood money payment system, each of the constituent nations was better able to engage in offensive and defensive action against outside enemies.'

'The languages of the 6 tribes are classified in the Northern Iroquoian branch of the Iroquoian language family.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_UsIroqE] The Iroquois Peoples include the Iroquois Confederacy, but also other independent nations: 'Iroquois, any member of the North American Indian tribes speaking a language of the Iroquoian family-notably the Cayuga, Cherokee, Huron, Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Seneca, and Tuscarora. The peoples who spoke Iroquoian languages occupied a continuous territory around Lakes Ontario, Huron, and Erie, in present-day New York state and Pennsylvania (U.S.) and southern Ontario and Quebec (Canada). That larger group should be differentiated from the Five Nations (later Six Nations) better known as the Iroquois Confederacy (self name Haudenosaunee Confederacy).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_UsIroqE] 'Between the Hudson and lake Erie, our broad territory was occupied by the Ho-de[unknown] -no-sau-nee,   or Iroquois, scattered far and wide, in small encampments, or in disconnected villages. Their council-fires, emblematical of civil jurisdiction, burned continuously from the Hudson to Niagara. At the era of Dutch discovery (1609), they had pushed their permanent possession as far west as the Genesee; and shortly after, about 1650, they extended it to the Niagara. They then occupied the entire territory of our State west of the Hudson, with the exception of certain tracts upon that river below the junction of the Mohawk, in the possession of the River Indians, and the country of the Delawares, upon the Delaware river. But both these had been subdued by the conquering Iroquois, and had become tributary nations.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_UsIroqE] Iroquois expansionism enabled cross-cultural exchange with defeated enemies: 'The Iroquois were not nomadic hunters like many of their neighbors to the north and west. Instead they settled in more or less permanent villages and depended mainly upon their crops of corn, beans and squash for food. The settled life gave them greater political and social unity and this fact was largely responsible for their success as conquerors and governors. Their conquests brought them in contact with many tribes with cultures varying in  greater and lesser degrees from their own and from each they absorbed elements that modified or enhanced it.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_UsIroqE] The wider sphere of cultural interaction also includes the early colonial powers: 'Thus the League of the Iroquois was an alliance conceived among aboriginal nations which, though culturally related and speaking languages fundamentally similar but differing in vocabulary and idiom, had recurrently been in conflict. The league brought them out of conflict into peace. Then came the French, the Dutch, and the English, and the doom of the league was sealed, its desired results nullified. Here was an alliance binding together five distinct nations, based upon an orally transmitted constitution. It had no inscribed statutes, no taxes or levies, no gendarmerie, no hireling politicians. We hear, however, of tribute exacted of subjugated tribes. Tribute, as the Iroquois took it, consisted of stipulated sums of wampum demanded of the Algonkian tribes on the Atlantic Coast who produced it; and wampum was not an item of money, cash, or currency in native economy before the coming of Europeans to the Hudson Valley.

It sheltered within its walls the five tribes who kept the five fires of the longhouse. At the ends of the house stood the doorkeepers, the Mohawk at the east and the Seneca at the west. In between these were the Oneida who kept the second fire and the Cayuga who kept the fourth fire. They were regarded as the younger brothers whose duty it was to care for the captives. In the center were the Onondaga who kept the ever-burning central fire and presided over the council of the league, and whose principal village (Onondaga, later Onondaga Castle) was the capital of the confederacy. At one time Onondaga was one of the most important and widely known towns in North America north of Mexico.'

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_46_UsIroqE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Finger Lakes region of the modern-day state of New York was once part of Iroquois territory. On the eve of European contact, this territory stretched from Lake Champlain and Lake George west to the Genesee River and Lake Ontario and from the St. Lawrence River south to the Susquehanna River. Originally, the League of the Iroquois was a confederacy of five Native American tribes (the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca), joined by a sixth tribe, the Tuscarora, in 1722, following its northward migration from the Roanoke River. This confederacy was created between 1400 and 1600 CE. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the confederacy was overall able to exploit the establishment of the European fur trade to its advantage, playing French and English interests off against one another, and gaining a major role in economic and political affairs. As a result of this, the Iroquois - particularly the Seneca - also frequently clashed with other Native tribes, such as the Huron, Petun, Neutral and Susquehannock. Eventually, the Iroquois also came into conflict with the Europeans, first with the French, then with the American revolutionaries. Starting in the 19th century, the Iroquois tribes settled on reservations in western New York state, southern Quebec and southern Ontario.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_47_UsIroqE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The central Iroquois League Council dealt with common affairs, while tribal chiefs and councils (as well as the female elders of their respective lineages and more recently created non-hereditary positions) occupied an intermediary position. The council included 50 men and women representing the five original tribes and had legislative, executive and judiciary powers, but it only deliberated on matters relating to foreign affairs (for example, peace and war) as well as matters of common interest to all five tribes.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_48_UsIroqE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]According to Gerald Reid, there were around 5,500 Iroquois at the beginning of the 17th century.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_49_UsIroqE]</div></body></html>
