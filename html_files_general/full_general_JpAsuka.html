These were years of vast and fundamental change in the island kingdom, of cultural forced feeding and vigorous new growth. In particular, they were the years when Japan became fully and for all time a participant in the high civilization of East Asia. Participation meant religious and philosophical orientations, an ideal of imperial rule, legal and administrative structures, techniques and styles of architecture, city planning, sculpture, painting, and music - all derived directly or indirectly from China and shared in one degree or another by the peoples on its periphery.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_JpAsuka]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Asuka; Naniwa; Asuka; Fujiwara ♥</b> Asuka:538-645 CE; Naniwa: 645-672 CE; Asuka: 672-694 CE; Fujiwara: 694-710 CE[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_JpAsuka]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Old Japanese ♥</b>[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_JpAsuka]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Japonic ♥</b>The last segment of the Kofun period is often designated by historians as Asuka period on the basis of the intoduction of the Buddhism religion in 538 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_JpAsuka][MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_JpAsuka] As a consequence the historical period "Asuka" overlaps with the archaeological period "Kofun" until 710 CE.The Asuka period can be divided into two main phases. The first phase covers the period (572-645 CE) when four successive heads of the Soga clan were leading figures at court: Saga no Iname, Saga no Umako, Siga no Emishi, and Soga no Ir. The second period is the phase after the violent overthrow of the Soga which was dominated by Tenchi Tenno, his brother Temmu Tenno, and Temmu's widow Jito Tenno from 645 to 692. It ends with the abdication of Jito Tenno in favor of her son Mommu and the move of the capital to the Heijō Palace of Nara.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_JpAsuka][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]In this period there is the establishment of a central administrative control with the introduction of the Ritsuryo law system based on Chinese style law codes.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_JpAsuka][MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_JpAsuka]The introduction of Buddhism in Japan was favoured by the Soga clan, a Japanese court family, which acquired political prominence with the ascension of the emperor Kimmei in 531.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_JpAsuka] The Soga clan intoduced Chinese model-based fiscal policies, etsablished the first national treasury and promoted trade links with the Korean peninsula.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_JpAsuka] With the Taika reform the size of large burial tumuli (kofun) was strongly decreased by imperial decree.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_JpAsuka] The disappearance of large tumuli coincided with the emergence of a marked pyramidal hierarchy indicated by the difference in the burial assemblage.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_JpAsuka] In the seventh century a deceased person was buried in individual, very small round tumuli, which were much smaller than the preceding monumental mounded tombs. However, burial tumuli disapperead at the end of the seventh century.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_JpAsuka][MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_JpAsuka] During this period elites began devoting resources to the building of Buddhist temples, which explains the reduction in size of tombs[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_JpAsuka][MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_JpAsuka][MAJIDBENAM_BR]We have estimated the population of Kansai to be between 1.5 million and 2 million people in 600 CE, and between 2 million and 3 million by 700 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_JpAsuka] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_JpAsuka]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Asuka Kingdom ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Asuka_600CE: 538CE-710CE ♥</b>  Asuka_600CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_JpAsuka]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  193724: 538CE-710CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Japonic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Japanesic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Middle Old Japanese ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Shinto ♥</b></div></body></html>
