This might be the earliest known reference to the Mongols.  few centuries later, another Chinese document, this time dating to 1084, describes the "Menggu" as a remote tribe that paid tribute to the Khitan; they lived on a mixture of hunting and pastoralism, they were believed to wear fish skins, and their technology was largely made out of wood and bone because of the Khitans' (and, subsequently, the Jurchens') ban on the exportation of iron. With time, more clans joined the Mongols, such as the Jajirad and the Qonggirad. In the twelfth century, under Jurchen rule, the Mongols became one of the leading steppe tribes, and indeed they rebelled against the Jurchen. At first, the Mongols managed to score a number of victories, and for some time the Jurchen had no choice but to appease them through gifts such as cattle, grains, and silks. However, the Jurchen eventually gained the upper hand, capturing Mongol slaves through regular military expeditions between the 1160s and the 1190s, and forcing the Mongol rulers to pay frequent tribute. Chinggis Khan stopped the tributes in 1210.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_MnMongE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]At this time, the Mongols were divided into clans, and each clan belonged to either the Niru'un or the Dürlükin moiety. The Niru'un clans ruled the Dürlükin ones, though, due to traditional rules of exogamy, the Niru'un had to marry among the Dürlükin and vice versa.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_MnMongE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The overall population of Mongolia was 600,000-1,000,000.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_MnMongE] Between 80,000 and 120,000 seems like a reasonable estimate for just the Mongols, who inhabited the region alongside similarly sized peoples, such as the Naimans, Kereids, Tatars, and Merkids.</div></body></html>
