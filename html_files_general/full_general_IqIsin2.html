We know of around twenty provinces ruled by a governor (šakin ma¯ti, then šakin te¯mi). Some of these provinces were named after their main city (Nippur, Isin, Dur-Kurigalzu, and so on). There were also other territorial entities and tribal ‘houses’ (defined with the term Bït plus the name of the ancestor). The ‘urban’ provinces were mainly in the north (in the former land of Akkad), and less in the south, where Ur seems to have been the most vital city. ‘Tribal’ provinces were mainly located in the area east of the Tigris. It is possible that, within the land, the traditional duties of the ‘governors’ were taking care of irrigation systems and temple architecture. In the provinces along the borders, these tasks were more military and governors had a more personal, rather than administrative, relationship with the king."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_IqIsin2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ IqBabKs ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Second Sealand Dynasty ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Babylon ♥</b> "The first kings of the new dynasty of Isin had to face the Elamite pressures of Kutir-Nahhunte and Shilhak-Inshushinak.

As a confederated state there were around twenty provinces that were ruled by a governor who had an administrative role in the more urban northern provinces. The smaller provinces along the border were more likely to be run by the military while the governor had a personal relationship with the king and their role was more honorary than administrative.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_IqIsin2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Goods were transported by water and traded through exchange, with the main commodities being silver and grains.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_IqIsin2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Written records, scripts, poems, religious texts and ‘scientific’ literature increased during this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_IqIsin2]</div></body></html>
