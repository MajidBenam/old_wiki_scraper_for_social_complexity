According to most scholars this period spans from around 300 BCE to 300 CE [MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_JpYayoi][MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_JpYayoi]. According to Mizoguchi (2013) this period spans from ca. 400 BCE to ca. 200 CE. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_JpYayoi]. This period is divided into three sub-phases: Early Yayoi (400 BCE - 200 BCE; 300 - 100 BCE),Middle Yayoi (200 BCE - 1/50 CE; 100 BCE - 100 CE), and Late Yayoi (1/50 CE - 250 CE; 100 CE - 300 CE).</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ quasi-polity ♥</b> i.e. not a unitary state.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣  ♥</b> Vassalage to China?From the chinese dynastic histories <i>Houhanshu</i> and <i>Weizhi</i> it is known that people from western Japan sent envoys to the Han Dynasty court probably through the Lelang commandery in Korea in 57 and 107 CE. Also, between 238 and 247 BC four envoys were sent from western Japan to Taifang for submitting tribute, which consisted of cloths, jade, pearls, bows and arrows, cinnabar, and slaves. They returned with several gifts from the court: silk, gold, swords, bronze mirrors, read beads.

These units developed different sets of material culture (pottery, metal object) burial practice and settlement hierarchy.

Rather, they were the largest regional centres in Kansai region. Karako (Nara prefecture) had an extent of about 30 hectares (14.8 hectares excluding circumference ditches). Ikegami-Sone's size was about 25 hectares (7.2 hectares excluding circumference ditches)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_JpYayoi].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Japanese ♥</b>It seems that the agricultural immigrants of the Yayoi period brought the Japanese language from the Korean peninsula[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_JpYayoi].</div><div class='meatypart'></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Japonic ♥</b>Japonic, the language family containing Japanese, Ryūkyūan and other dialects appears to have its roots in the Korean Peninsula. Nevertheless, attempts to determine the origin of Japonic are still controversial[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_JpYayoi].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Yayoi period in the Kansai region (Yayoi period in the Kinki region) is an Iron Age period in Japan marked by the introduction of rice farming, metalworking, cloth making, and new forms of pottery from continental Asia.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_JpYayoi] The beginning of the Yayoi period was characterized by substantial changes and the introduction of new cultural features in the daily life. In the early Yayoi period (ca. 400 BCE - 200 BCE; 300 - 100 BCE) such innovations consisted of new type of houses, burial practices, settlement structures and more importantly of the introduction of full scale farming.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_JpYayoi] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_JpYayoi] The new type of house, consisting of a rectangular or round sub-types,spread throughout western Japan (from Kyushu to Kansai) by the end of the Early Yayoi period. In this period settlements started being enclosed by V-sectioned ditches.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_JpYayoi] Another important change was that, in a given settlement, burial grounds were separated by the dwelling area. The dead were mostly buried in rectangular ditch-enclosed burial compounds covered by low earthen mounds. The introduction of rice paddy field agriculture had big impact in the social structure of the Japanese Yayoi communities. The archaeological evidence of paddy fields suggest that Yayoi communities were able to set up paddies in different topographic and climatic environments. Their maintenance and construction required an unprecedented scale of collaboration and social organization.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_JpYayoi][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Middle Yayoi period saw also an increase of stone and metal tools, bronze mirrors and weapons deposited mainly as grave goods and <i>Dokatu</i> bronze bells deposited as ritual tools. The spread of bronze mirrors and metal objects can be interpreted as the result of trade contacts between western japanese chiefdoms and the Chinese Lelang commandery in Korean peninsula.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_JpYayoi] During the Late Yayoi period (1/50-200 CE; 100 - 300 CE) we have marked evidence of social stratification.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_JpYayoi][MAJIDBENAM_BR]During the Yayoi/Kofun Transition Period (200-250/75 CE), according to Mizoguchi's periodization,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_JpYayoi] or the final Late Yayoi period, according to Barnes' periodization, in western Japan emerged the polity (perhaps a chiefdom) of Yamatai ruled by the queen Himiko. Unfortunately, the evidence of the presence of this polity come from the Chinese dynastic histories and there is not agreement among the scholars about the location of Yamatai. Some scholars located Yamatai in northern Kyushu,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_JpYayoi] while others located it in Kansai.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_JpYayoi][MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_JpYayoi] The queen Himiko may have seized the power between the 189 and the 238 CE and her death could be dated to the 248 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_JpYayoi][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the Early Yayoi period, significant features such as ditch-enclosed settlements, paddy fields and irrigation systems required a hierarchical structure able to mobilize the needed labour force and coordinate different tasks. As consequence, the Early Yayoi period saw the emergence of a ranked society, where members of a "warrior class" were responsible for guaranteeing and protecting communal interests.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_JpYayoi][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the Middle Yayoi period (ca. 200 BCE - 1/50 CE; 100 BCE - 100 CE) there is a significant increase in the population, which results in the emergence of large central-type settlements. Hence, there is a two-tiered settlement hierarchy characterized by larger villages acting as regional centres and smaller satellite settlements. A Middle Yayoi settlement was composed of several residential units (hamlets)that were part of a larger kin-based corporate group cross-cutting several different villages.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_JpYayoi] This would have favoured the relations and cooperation between villages on regional scale. There is a peer-polity interaction between the chiefdoms distributed in Western Japan. Each hamlet had its own burial ground and storage facilities and perhaps was occupied by 30 individuals. The regional centres of Western Japan often contained more than 3-4 hamlets and could reach an overall population higher than 200 inhabitants. More research is needed on total Yayoi population.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]We know from the Chinese documents that the Japanese chiefs acquired the title of <i>wang</i> (king) ad consequence of the tribute they submitted to the Chinese Han dynasty trough the Lelang commandery.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_JpYayoi] In the Middle Yayoi period burial compounds, mortuary rectangular allotments usually enclosed by a ditch and covered by an earth mound, are introduced. The spatial distribution of these burial features (usually located beside large regional centres), their skeletal remains (almost all adult males) and their grave good assemblages (bronze weapons, bronze mirrors, cylindrical beads, etc.) suggest that the individuals buried in the compounds were regional chiefs or leaders belonging to a number of corporate groups.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_JpYayoi][MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_JpYayoi] Overall, the evidence suggest that the status of the elite was achieved rather than being ascribed.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the Late Yayoi period, the elites started showing their dominance within a settlement by living in clear marked compounds enclosed by ditches and containing raised-floor storage buildings. In addition, clustering of iron tools have been found in proximity of the elites compounds. This evidence suggest that the elites controlled the means of production and the storage and distribution of products.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_JpYayoi] In this period in the rectangular burial compounds, not only adults, but also children and infants were buried, suggesting that the elite status was no longer achieved during their lifetimes but inherited at birth. The population saw also an intensification of inter-communal competition.</div></body></html>
