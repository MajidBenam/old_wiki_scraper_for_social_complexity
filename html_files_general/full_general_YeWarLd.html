Control of the Tihama swayed back and forth between the Najahid rulers and the Sulayhid power of the highlands. In the mid 12th century, 'Ali bin Mahdi finally brought about the end of the Najahid dynasty."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_YeWarLd][MAJIDBENAM_BR]An "era of the 'war lords'" existed "until Rasulid times."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_YeWarLd][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The Sulayhids [like Charlemagne] revived an ancient empire by their talents, basing their work on lofty political and religious principle. The latter, however, did not coincide with the aspirations of many of their subjects. Nor do the Sulayhids seem to have had a clear concept of Yemen as an economic unit to be strengthened and articulated."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_YeWarLd][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Sulayhids: Shi'i dynasty which ruled over Yemen as nominal vassals of the Fatimids from 1047 till 1138. It was founded by 'Ali b. Muhammad, who chased the Abyssinian slave dynasty of the Najahids from Zabid, fought the Zaydi Imam al-Qasim b. 'Ali and took San'a' in 1063, Zabid in 1064 and Aden in 1065. He restored order in Mecca and appointed Abu Hashim Muhammad (r. 1063-1094) as Sharif. He was killed by the Najahid Sa'id b. Najah (d. 1088) in 1067. His son al-Mukarram (r. 1067-1091) again conquered Zabid from the Najahids and rescued his other Asma' bint Shihab (d. 1086). In the same year 1086 he instituted a new coinage called 'Maliki Dinars', but left state affairs to his wife al-Sayyida Arwa (b. 1052, r. 1084-1138), who transferred her residence from San'a' to Dhu Jibla in winter, making the castle of Ta'kar, where the treasures of the Sulayhids were stored, her residence in summer. In 1119 the Fatimid Caliph al-'Amir sent Ibn Najib al-Dawla as an emissary to Yemen. He reduced the smaller principalities to obedience but Queen Arwa was able to resist his endeavours. At her death the Sulayhid dynasty came to an end, and power passed to the Zuray'ids, who were to hold it until the arrival of the Ayyubid Turan-Shah in 1174."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_YeWarLd][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Sulayhids: Queen Arwa died aged 92 in 1137 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_YeWarLd][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"the rise and fall of the Najahid princes of Zabid (1020s-1150s), a city that was one of the early recipients of Abyssinian slaves through Dahlak, illustrates the closeness of ties between the Yemeni coast and its opposite shores across the Red Sea, as well as the multifaceted impact of slavery networks in this region. ... On losing their city to the rising Sulayhid power of the Yemeni highlands, the defeated Najahid rulers, who were of Abyssinian slave origin, took refuge in Dahlak, where they plotted their return. In preparation for storming the Najahid city, the Sulayhid leader, al-Mukarram, instructed his troops to refrain from killing black Africans in Zabid, and instead to subject them first to a linguistic test; if when asked to pronounce the Arabic phoneme 'z,' they produced a 'z', then they were fair game, their accent having just betrayed them as pure Abyssinians and presumably part of what was percieved as a foreign Abyssinian cadre ruling the city; but if they pronounced the phoneme in the standard peninsular Arabic way, they were to be considered Arabs and spared, because 'Arab men in these coastal regions have children with black slaves and black skin is shared by free and slave alike.'"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_YeWarLd]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ ♥</b>"From the foregoing brief account, it may be seen that in one sense there was a Yemeni polity during these troubled centuries. At no time did the values and objectives of would-be rulers and of the population at large agree. Tribes, dynasties, and religious leaders nevertheless acted frequently, if intermittently, over most of Yemen's territory ... The ad hoc, evanescent coalitions formed are characteristic of a segmental pattern of authority, and thus of weakness of the political system as a whole. Some dynasties - the Sulayhids, the Zuray'ids, the Najab - succeeded in assembling substantial material resources, and were wealthy by the standards of the time; but they failed in the essential task of mobilizing the human energies needed to build and defend a viable Yemeni state. This consequent debility made Yemen an attractive target for foreign ambitions, and the country was in fact to become a family colony of the Ayyubids."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_YeWarLd]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ nominal ♥</b>Sulayhids: In 1110 CE the Fatimids in Egypt "sent an Armenian commander, Ibn Najib al-Dawla, as a da'i to reign in the chaotic situation in Yemen.
