The first excavation director, Rodney Young, found evidence for substantial destruction during the first decade of fieldwork; this was interpreted as proof that Gordion had been destroyed ca. 700 B.C. by the Kimmerians, a group of invaders from the Caucusus/Black Sea region, as attested in several ancient literary sources. During the last decade, however, renewed research on the archaeological evidence, within, above, and below the destruction level indicated that the catastrophe that destroyed much of Gordion occurred 100 years earlier, in 800 B.C., and was the result of a fire that quickly got out of control rather than a foreign invasion."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_TrPhryg][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"According to Greek tradition, the earliest Phrygians were immigrants from Macedon and Thrace. ...

'Phrygian' is a Greek name while Assyrian texts refer to a Muški kingdom[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_TrPhryg] "a fierce, aggressive, tribal people" who could be a separate people or a people who formed a union with the Phrygians in the 8th century.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_TrPhryg] The kingdom's most developed phase occurred under king Midas who ruled from the city of Gordium in the late 8th century.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_TrPhryg][MAJIDBENAM_BR]We cannot say much about the organization of Phrygia at its peak development except that it was a monarchy that ruled from Gordium, a town of perhaps 20,000 inhabitants. The capital of Midas's hypothesized Mushki-Phrygian union is assumed to have been named after Midas's father. Earlier names in the dynasty are unknown.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_TrPhryg] Archaeologist know of three political documents but have not been able to decipher them. The Phrygian language is not known, and its similarity to Greek languages has only allowed for fragments of texts to be understood.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]While we nothing about a central (palace based?) administration that may have been present archaeologists believe that other cities in Phrygia had their own governments[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_TrPhryg] and a great deal of autonomy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_TrPhryg] The biggest cities had governors.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_TrPhryg][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The beginning date for the Phrygian period is somewhat arbitrary, based on archaeological records. The end of the Phrygian period, however, is clearly marked by a conquest - it is the year when the Phrygian Kingdom was conquered by the Lydian Kingdom, which de facto put an end to the existence of the Phrygian period.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Phrygian Kingdom ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Phrygia_900BCE: 900BCE-801BCE; Phrygia_800BCE: 800BCE-701BCE; Phrygia_700BCE: 700BCE-695BCE ♥</b>  Phrygia_700BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_TrPhryg] Phrygia_800BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_TrPhryg] Phrygia_900BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_TrPhryg]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  109155: 900BCE-801BCE;  177246: 800BCE-701BCE;  149563: 700BCE-695BCE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Graeco-Phrygian ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Phrygian ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Ancient Anatolian Religion ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Phrygian Religion ♥</b></div></body></html>
