The beginning of Mehrgarh I is based on newer dates which suggest that settlement and food production began well before 7000 BCE as originally thought. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_PkAcerN] Earliest occupation at Mehrgarh was identified in the so-called area MR 3 (7 m of stratified deposits). These levels seem to not yield ceramic materials; however, fired ceramic figurines and asphalt-covered baskets are found.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_PkAcerN][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The earliest sedentary populations in  South Asia thus appear to have been relatively small, and to have favoured specific ecological zones for the establishment of their settlements. In this earliest stage, it is likely that sedentary populations co-existed with hunter gatherers, and at least at Mehrgarh, it appears that the initial farming populations also engaged in hunting.

It is impossible to say whether Mehrgarh was part of a wider network of agricultural communities in the region, or whether it was unique and/or isolated. Besides agriculture, the inhabitants of Mehrgarh also relied, at this time, on hunting and gathering, but not yet on pastoralism.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_PkAcerN][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]It is not possible to give an accurate estimate of the region's population at this time,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_PkAcerN] and the size of occupied Mehrgarh is uncertain, as the population shifted over time and part of the site has been cut away by the Bolan River.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_PkAcerN] Similarly, the literature does not provide many clues as to the political organization of Mehrgarh or any other site in the region at this time.</div></body></html>
