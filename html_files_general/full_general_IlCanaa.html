However, cognates of the form כנען (Cana'an) are most common.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternative names ♣ Ga-na-na, Ka-na-na, Kenah, Kena'an, Southern Levant ♥</b> "Ga-na-na" is an obscure reference found on an Eblaite tablet from Tell Mardikh, which may be the earliest reference to Canaan; however, the reference is uncertain.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_IlCanaa] "Ka-na-na" is used in early Egyptian sources to refer to a territory just inside Asia; its use is not concurrent with the use of other forms of Canaan in later Egyptian records, leading some scholars to believe that it is an early term for the same region.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_IlCanaa] "Kenah" and "Kena'an" both appear in the Amarna Letters. "Southern Levant" is a retrospective term for the region used by many modern scholars, though there is disagreement over the exact geographical area so defined.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Peak Date ♣ 1550 BCE ♥</b> The end of the Middle Bronze Age, and the last point at which the Canaanite "Hyksos" controlled the Egyptian Delta. Shortly thereafter, Egypt reunified under Ahmose, who expelled the Hyksos from the Delta. Following this, Egypt launched a devastating series of invasions of Canaan, notably under Thutmose III; the effect of these was to reduce the Canaanite city-states to vassal status, and (judging from Egyptian records) to drain a great deal of wealth away to Egypt.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_IlCanaa]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 2000-1175 BCE♥</b> Beginning with the Middle Bronze Age, c. 2000 BCE, and ending with the chaotic destruction period in which the Canaanite cities seemed to fall for good—perhaps because of "Sea People" invasions, perhaps because of ecological stresses, perhaps from Hapiru revolts, perhaps from Israelite invasion, or other factors, or a combination of all of the above.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_IlCanaa]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ quasi-polity ♥</b> Canaan featured several city-states, which sometimes formed larger coalitions with each other; in any case, there were usually several opposing coalitions within the territory of Canaan.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ unknown: 2000-1550 BCE; nominal allegiance: 1549-1462 BCE; alliance: 1461-1460 BCE; vassalage: 1459-1175 BCE ♥</b>1550 BCE is the approximate point at which Thutmose I expelled the Hyksos from the Nile Delta, following which the Egyptians invaded Canaan and imposed tribute. For the next several decades, Egyptian control was relatively light, and sometime around 1470 BCE (plus or minus a decade) several Canaanite cities joined a confederation led by Durusha, king of Kadesh, in rebellion against Egypt. Thutmose III then invaded Canaan, leading to the Battle of Megiddo in which the Egyptians won decisively. Following their victory, Egyptian rule become much more involved and oppressive; military garrisons and administrative centers were built across Canaan, and heavy tribute was exacted. (However, Egyptian control was not uniform across Canaan, for example: "At the start of the Late Bronze Age (LB IA), Jaffa remained beyond the reach of the ad hoc campaigns of early 18th-Dynasty pharaohs, which appear to have been concentrated in the coastal plain to the south of Jaffa, with occasional raids made into the northern Levant from the Syrian coast. Jaffa’s first historical mention, as Yapu, occurs among a list of towns that were conquered in connection with the first campaign of Thutmose III…"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_IlCanaa]) Egyptian control periodically stimulated violent Canaanite resistance, sometimes to the extent of destroying whole Egyptian settlements (as with the 12th-century destruction of Jaffa).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_IlCanaa] This continued until the fall of Bronze Age Canaan.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Intermediate Bronze-Age Canaan ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Ancient Phoenicia ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ Amorite Near East ♥</b> Canaanites were part of the larger Amorite family of peoples, which included the founders of the first Babylonian Empire. Canaanite city-states had significant cultural links with other societies in the Northern Levant and Mesopotamia, and had thriving trade contacts with them. Canaanite architecture often shows influence from the Northern Levant, i.e. Syria. Religious artifacts are similar enough that it is customary to infer details of Canaanite religion from that of Ugarit, which is outside of Canaan proper.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_IlCanaa]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣ 300,000 ♥</b>km squared. Very rough estimate.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Hazor ♥</b> Repeatedly referenced in external writings as the most prominent of the Canaanite city-states, and sometimes described as the leader of the most powerful confederacy. Is the largest archaeological tel for Bronze Age Canaan. Described in the biblical Book of Joshua (11:10) as the "head of all [the Canaanite] kingdoms." "The textual evidence also implies that Hazor's prominence stemmed from its central inland position and its role as a point of articulation between the peoples of Egypt and Mesopotamia…. It is also the only Canaanite city mentioned in both the Egyptian 'Excration Texts' and the Mari texts."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_IlCanaa]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Canaanite ♥</b> Strictly speaking, "Canaanite" could refer to a number of closely related Northwest Semitic dialects spoken during the period that are distinct from Aramaic dialects (by the use of the h- prefix for the definite article). They include early Phoenician, early Hebrew, and several other local dialects.</div><div class='meatypart'></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Semitic ♥</b>Left map: Rough outline of Late Bronze Age Canaan.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_IlCanaa] Right map: cluster analysis of archaeological sites to identify likely polities, superimposed on a much earlier effort (which assumed that no territory was unclaimed) based largely on the Amarna letters.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_IlCanaa] Note that the right-hand map restricts itself to roughly the territory of modern Israel only for reasons of data availability, not because they claim that "Canaan" did not extend further.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br>The borders of the territory called Canaan are referenced in several places in Egyptian texts, Mesopotamian writings, writings of the Canaanites themselves, writings from polities in the Northern Levant, and twice in the Hebrew Bible. While none of these references is complete in itself, they are all fairly consistent with each other and when combined yield a reasonable set of borders.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_IlCanaa] Canaan extended north just past Byblos, but did not include Ugarit, and went east past the Jordan River to include parts of Transjordan as well as cities such as Damascus and Sidon.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]_Short description_[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Very little is known about the ancient Canaanites and what is known is often through references given by other cultures (such as the Egyptians). Even combined with what is known and not known from archaeological work the overall picture of Canannite society should be taken as a very provisional one.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Canaanites seem to have lived between 2000-1175 BCE, from a time contemporary to the Middle Kingdom of Ancient Egypt, the Canaanite Hyksos Period of Egypt and their expulsion, through the New Kingdom of Egypt, to the invasion of the Sea Peoples (which have often been associated with the destruction of Canaanite cities).[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Outside of the city-state organization the Canaanites did not achieve any territorial centralization in the Levant. The Canaanites lived in hierarchical city-states that would form alliances and fight opposing coalitions of Canaanites. The region as a whole was under Egyptian control after the invasion of Thutmose III.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]One tentative archaeological interpretation of Canaanite government holds that Canaanite regimes were more similar to an household <i>oikos</i> economy than a Mesopotamian-style redistributive state: "in sharp contrast to both the Aegean and the entire ancient Near East, there is not a single indication that literate administration ever played any significant role in the [Middle Bronze Age] Canaanite economy."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_IlCanaa][MAJIDBENAM_BR]However, it appears at least some Canaanites did use writing to record laws. Two fragments of a larger clay tablet (designated Hazor 18) were discovered in 2010 at Tel Hazor, that would possibly have contained as many as 20 or 30 laws (which in turn could have been part of a larger collection of law tablets) in a format similar to the Code of Hammurabi. An earlier tablet, Hazor 5, contains part of the description of a lawsuit, judged by the king personally.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_IlCanaa] It is likely that at least some Canaanite polities would have had formal law codes.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The population of the Canaanites probably never exceeded much beyond 50,000 people in a single polity, though more were likely present towards the end of the period than at the beginning.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br>_Oren's long description_[MAJIDBENAM_BR]During the Bronze Age, Canaan was composed of dozens of "city-states," some strong enough to lead regional confederations against each other or against outside invaders. These city-states appear to have been significantly institutionalized, featuring standing armies, bureaucracies and public works, and official cults. The social structure was highly unequal; most of the land was concentrated in the hands of the small ruling class, with the vast majority of inhabitants being serfs, slaves, or landless vagabonds or nomads. The economy depended heavily on trade, with intensive agriculture of staples such as wine and oil meant for export in exchange for prestige goods such as imported pottery, and tin for making bronze.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Canaan of the Middle and Late Bronze was by no means a unified entity, even as its polities shared significant cultural elements. The varying landscape carried with it different geopolitical conditions for each local polity, strongly conditioning the development of each one and its various political/strategic needs. "The Coastal Plain, the setting for the region's largest political and economic centers, conventionally seen as the hearth of Canaanite civilization, emerges as a hodge-podge of polities with highly variable structures and their attendant political connotations. The Jordan Rift, normally seen as a smaller-scale backwater off the Mediterranean littoral, features settlement patterns most consistent with a series of highly integrated peer polities or city-states, and subregional political coherence. In contrast to both of these lowland areas, the settlement clusters of the Hill Country are more dispersed, with consistent evidence of less settlement integration. When considered structurally, these results suggest three fundamentally different bases for political development in a region normally viewed as a single, albeit fractious, social and cultural entity during the Late Bronze Age. These distinctions help illuminate the foundations of the particularly volatile political dynamics of the southern Levant."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_IlCanaa][MAJIDBENAM_BR]During the Middle Bronze, Canaanite polities were wealthy and powerful enough to extend their influence into the Egyptian Delta (via the so-called "Hyksos). However, the end of the Middle Bronze is marked by the campaign of Thutmose I, who expelled the Hyksos and then campaigned into Canaan proper, imposing Egyptian overlordship over many of the Canaanite cities. As the Late Bronze progressed, Canaanite cities were marked with increasing social turmoil, wracked by repeated uprisings against Egyptian officials or against local elites, and facing periodic invasions from the sea or pressure from the Hittite Empire. The politics of this period are somewhat better understood thanks to the finding of the Amarna Letters, some 350 clay tablets of Egyptian diplomatic correspondence that date to about the middle of the 14th Century BCE. Many of them are from Canaanite "mayors," sending groveling obeisances to the Pharaoh and pleading for military assistance in the face of urgent threats. Finally, during the 12th Century BCE, a series of poorly-understood calamities and city destructions brought the Bronze Age Canaanite civilization to a close; it would be succeeded by the Phoenicians to the north, and the Israelites in the Judean highlands.[MAJIDBENAM_BR](A word of caution is in order about coding methodology. Much of the evidence we have about this polity comes from archaeological finds. However, the brute fact of an archaeological artifact is often used as the basis for considerable interpretation and conjecture. Methods have been improving over time, but still some archaeologists tend to leap far ahead of what the evidence will support. Additionally, the meaning of many finds is hotly disputed by archaeologists, each faction insisting for its point of view: "When any scholar defends the correctness or appropriateness of a singular point of view, or set of data, everything else tends to be analyzed accordingly - alternative views are intensely criticized, dismissed, or ignored entirely, while complementary views or evidence are presented with little critical reflection. Whether the evidence is archaeological or scientific, often it is only partial or ambiguous and so becomes easy to interpret or manipulate in a manner that serves to perpetuate a preconceived idea or point of view. The outcome is often a selective filtering of data and related information and an unwillingness to contemplate or envisage a counter position."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_IlCanaa][MAJIDBENAM_BR]This is a particular problem with regard to establishing chronologies. While on a given archaeological site researchers are (usually) able to determine the boundaries of relative temporal layers, tying those layers to an absolute timeline, or even fitting them into a relative relationship with the layers of other sites, is a fraught business; and when the time period in question is as far back as the Middle Bronze, the available evidence becomes correspondingly scarcer and more difficult to correlate with each other. Unfortunately, many researchers are too quick to claim certainty where none exists.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_IlCanaa][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In short, every data point that is backed up with archaeology must be considered provisional, and new discoveries can totally upend our picture of what happened—as can new interpretations that correct erroneous early interpretations, a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~fisher/hst140/MotelOfMysteries.html">constant danger</a> with motivated archaeologists.)</div></body></html>
