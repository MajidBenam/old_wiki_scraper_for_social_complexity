The presence of the state is suggested by the evidence of political control and the use of an adminsitrative structure. References to units of adiministration and of what appear to be official designations point to a monarchical system. The title of mahamatra is suggestive of the Mauryan designation. The mahabhoja and maharathi as officials may in origin have been associated with high office in the Bhoja and Rathika clans and made the transition to administrative office when the requirements of the state demanded it. The constituents of the seven limbs of the state, the saptanga, are reflected in these and other indications such as the reference to Satavahana armies in action against the ksatrapas, to allies and enemies, to the treasury from the existence of Satavahana coins and revenue collection, to the capital from references to Pratishana and finally to the recognition of territory under Satavahana control."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_InDecKg]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Deccan - Iron Age ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Satavahana Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣ ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣  ♥</b>Here we look at Southern India in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE, that is, between the collapse of the Mauryan Empire and the rise of the Satavahana Dynasty. Unfortunately, this appears to be a very poorly understood period in this region.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]No population estimates could be found in the literature. Information relating to political organization within our region of interest--roughly corresponding to the Bellary district in the modern-day Indian state of Karnataka--is also lacking, though sources suggest the existence of monarchies and an accompanying bureaucratic apparatus (scribes and mints, for example) in neighbouring regions.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_InDecKg]</div></body></html>
