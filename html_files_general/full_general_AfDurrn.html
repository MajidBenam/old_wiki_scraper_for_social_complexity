    <div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Peak Date ♣ 1761 CE ♥</b> Durrani power reached its peak in the aftermath of the Third
        Battle of Panipat during the reign of Ahmad Shah Durrani (1722 CE-1772 CE)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1]</div>
    <div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 1747-1826 CE ♥</b> The Dynasty was founded by a former soldier of the
        Afsharid kindgom, and eventual emir of Khorasan who conquered a large swath of territory. The Durrani dynasty
        was extinguished when Afghanistan fell into a period of sustained civil war in the period between 1818 CE-1826
        CE. The British attempted to install a puppet from the family line but this was not successful. The eventual
        victor was the the Barkzai dynasty, which came to power in 1837. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_2]</div>
    <div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ loose ♥</b> Ahmad Sh¯ah Durr¯an¯ı, Tim¯ ur Sh¯ah and later
        kings ruled through uniting the tribal groups in Afghanistan under them. However, there were internal rebellions
        from tribal chiefs and other ethnic groups. The kings after Tim¯ ur Sh¯ah were much less successful in holding
        the tribes together. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_3]</div>
    <div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥</b> The Durrani Empire was independent of other kingdoms
        and empires, although there were attempts to bring Afghanistan under control of external power e.g. the British.

    <div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b>The Duranni Empire (1747-1826 CE) was a political
        entity that lasted 79 years by plundering its higher populated and wealthier neighbors.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7]
        Founded by a former soldier of the Afsharid Kingdom named Ahmad Shah Durrani, at its maximum extent it covered
        over 1.5 million KM2 of territory surrounding modern-day Afganistan.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8]<br class="innerpar">Ahmad
        Shah Durrani had been elected to the monarchy by an inter-tribal assembly called the Loya
        Jirga.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9] Following his death in 1772 CE , rebellion and internal strife led to a loss of power
        so that by 1818 CE, the Durrani controlled a small territory surrounding the capital of
        Kabul.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10] The regime was finally extinguished when Afghanistan fell into a period of sustained
        civil war. The eventual victors were members of the Barkzai dynasty, who came to power in 1837 CE
        .[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11]<br class="innerpar">The Durrani state was an empire sustained and governed through the
        maintenance of a large number of armed horseman primarily recruited from the Pashtun peoples, although conquests
        in the period of 1747-1752 CE added horsemen from the Turkmen, Uzbek, Tajik, and Hazara tribes to the King's
        army.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12] The army was organized under a hierarchical tribal confederacy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13]<br
            class="innerpar">As a loose confederation of tribes there was not much in the way of an administration
        except for that possessed by conquered elites, who were largely left alone if they made their tribute payments.
        What short term central administrative posts that did exist were given to members of the governing
        tribes.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14] Soldiers received almost all the money: paid through generous land grants called
        Jegeirs, while the remaining revenue was spent on meeting the costs of the large army[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15] which
        expanded rapidly from 16,000 in 1747 to about 120,000 in 1761 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16]</div>
