The word also applies to the archaeological culture created by their ancestors from around A.D. 800 to the Spanish Conquest."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_CoTairo]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Peak Date ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 1050-1524 CE ♥</b>  Chronology: Santiago Giraldo and Juana Saenz [MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_CoTairo] based on radiocarbon dated goldwork (1000-1600 CE) and complete dated contexts with stone architecture and pottery (1100-1600 CE).[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Much like at Chengue Bay, at Pueblito and Ciudad Perdida, many “diagnostic” materials dating to the Neguanje period were found in contexts dating to the 7th, 8th, 9th and even the 10th centuries A.D. Changes in ceramics are so subtle as to be virtually indistinguishable from one phase to the next, or an early phase diagnostic style continues to appear in later phases. This poses some serious difficulties for breaking down larger periods into small phases based on the stylistic changes of diagnostic sherds and associating these to sociocultural changes." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Pollen studies by the Ecoandes Project show that the whole upper Buritaca area was covered by rainforest prior to the ninth century, but around the end of the tenth century human occupation and deforestation began. C14 dates obtained from an excavation I conducted in 1982 confirm that the early occupation of Ciudad Perdida began around 950 ± 60 BP." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"By the eighth or tenth century, transitional Nahuange-Tairona pottery had appeared at Buritaca 200, at 900 to 1,300 meters above sea level (Oyuela Cacedo 1986a), and the mature Tairona tradition was becoming established." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The ecological studies demonstrate how greatly and well the SNSM chiefdoms managed their landscapes, protecting and improving them. The center was occupied until the sixteenth century when the Spanish conquest began its processes of war and destruction.  The effects were catastrophic for the native population, reducing their numbers to less than 1% of pre-Hispanic highs following 100 years of continuous warfare. The region seems to have been completely abandoned around AD 1630 ± 55, based on C14 dates from collapsed structures and garbage (Oyuela-Caycedo 1986c, 1987a)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_CoTairo]"The term Tairona is a general, if not very accurate, label for the contact period Indian groups of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and the adjacent areas of the Caribbean coast (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1953: 17-27; Bischof 1971; 1982-83). The word also applies to the archaeological culture created by their ancestors from around A.D. 800 to the Spanish Conquest. Spanish fleets first visited this coast in 1501-1502, and in 1524 Rodrigo de Bastidas founded the port of Santa Marta, from which military expeditions explored and eventually subjugated the hinterland. Tairona resistance was not finally broken until 1600." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_CoTairo]"Archaeological excavations at Ciudad Perdida indicate two major phases. Between AD 1000 and 1300, ceramic styles suggest a close connection with the coast, while after AD 1300 connections shifted to the highland regions to the west. Ciudad Perdida and surrounding communities were occupied until the late 1500s, when genocidal raids by Spaniards annihilated over 90 percent of the native population, driving the survivors into even more remote refuges." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_CoTairo]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ quasi-polity ♥</b> "Between A.D. 1100-1200 and until their demise around A.D. 1600 after a century of disease, displacement, and war, these people continued to settle the narrow river valleys of the northern and western faces of the Sierra Nevada. It is these polities that are considered to be the “Tairona” proper and upon which the greater part of the research in the area has concentrated." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_CoTairo]"The socio-political organization of Tairona culture during the early part of the sixteenth century consisted of relatively independent chiefdoms, each including a priestly class and a hierarchy of chiefs as well as specialists in arts and crafts (e.g., gold workers, semiprecious stone engravers, merchants). This arts and crafts specialization, coupled with intensive exchange of agricultural products, was possible because of the regional ecological diversity found in the SNSM. The diversity encouraged the development of centers of specialization and regions of production for items such as ceramics, lithic artifacts, and agricultural products. At last archaeologists are beginning to understand the ancient system as they reconstruct the web of roads and pathways that connected all of the sites (Oyuela-Caycedo 1987a, 1990; Herrera de Turbay 1985; Kurela 1993; Herrera 2000)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_CoTairo]"I believe that a religious movement that included peoples with different languages and from diverse political units (Reichel-Dolmattoff 1954a, b; Reichel-Dolmatoff and Dussan 1955; Mason 1931, 1936, 1939; Oyuela-Caycedo 1986a) produced the expansion of the “Tairona culture”. Tairona culture was a religious complex that promoted colonization of the SNSM." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_CoTairo]"The Spanish encountered a truly complicated and fragmented political landscape with an assortment of ethnic and political groups of varying size, complexity, and regional power, amongst them those that may be thought of as the “Tairona”11 proper. Other groups residing in different parts of the Sierra Nevada at the end of the 15th century included the “Orejones” (Big Ears) and Chimilas to the Southwest and Southeast, the Tupe (Bari, Yuko-Yukpa) and Giriguano to the East, and the Guanebucan, Guajiro (Wayuu) and Cocina to the Northeast in the Guajira Peninsula. Spanish sources mention a number of “provinces” that they identify with these socio-political entities and called them accordingly; as in Provincia de los Orejones, Provincia de los Guanebucanes, and so on and so forth (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1951)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_CoTairo]"It is nevertheless, quite clear that some of these polities were larger and more powerful than others and actually exerted some degree of control over subject populations and territories. For example, 16th century Spanish sources constantly mention two notoriously large and powerful Tairona polities that stood out from all others: Bonda and Pocigueica, with whom they warred on and off throughout the 16th century. It is also equally true that no single polity exerted its domain over all others." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]At the time of conquest, various polities (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1951, 61):-Taironas along the rivers Don Diego, Buritaca and Guachaca (northern Sierra Nevada)-Bonda along the river Manzanares-the Santa Marta Coast populations also inhabited the Gaira and Durcino region to the South-another (possibly the same) group occupied the northern bays between Santa Marta and Dibulla-further away from Dibulla, the Guanebucán group-the populations of Betonia and Pocigueica</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ alliance ♥</b> "Major towns, such as Bonda and Pocigueica, were governed by chiefs (caciques) and seem to have formed the nuclei of incipient states. There is an unresolved debate about whether a higher level of organization ever existed. Reichel-Dolmatoff (1951: 88-90) argues that a number of confederations had emerged by the sixteenth century; Henning Bischof (1971; 1982-83) maintains that these were ephemeral alliances and that no permanent supralocal structure can be recognized." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_CoTairo]"The 16th century accounts also suggest that constantly shifting alliances and trading partnerships, as well as occasional warfare leading to control over large areas and neighboring towns were quite common for this time." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_CoTairo]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Neguanje ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b> "Ironically but unsurprisingly, while we were carrying out the architectural and topographic survey of Pueblito near the coast we were able to locate Neguanje period structures buried deep below Tairona terraces and structures on view to visitors and archaeologists alike. They had been, so to speak, underneath our noses all this time but had gone unnoticed by previous projects. Two overlapping Neguanje period dwellings, for example, were found almost 9 feet below the surface of a Tairona period terrace at Pueblito. In subsequent excavations at Teyuna-Ciudad Perdida we found the same pattern: earlier occupations and structures buried below structures that had been on view to everyone. When I discussed these findings in 2010 with Alicia Dussán, she indicated that it was quite clear that they had not been found because of the clean and very thick layers of fill separating the occupation levels. This had led them to assume only sterile layers of fill were to be found below Tairona household floors. This finding has allowed us to better understand the construction sequence of these places in a more nuanced and subtle fashion. Radiocarbon dates from buried occupations at both sites suggest that they were initially settled some time between A.D. 500 and A.D. 700, and grew relatively slowly up until A.D. 1100, reaching a size of about 30 acres. Core area plazas, terracing, and structures were then rapidly built some time between A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1200 and remained unchanged until A.D. 1600. That is, these areas were used and reused continuously but saw no major changes in their architectural layout. Yet both towns continued to expand after this time period, with growth concentrating mainly in residential areas. It is now clear that the Neguanje period peoples were directly related to the Tairona, and that there is a deeper time frame to the inhabitation and transformation of the northern and western side of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_CoTairo] Perhaps not in the Macro Chibchan sphere: "By A. D. 600 the Initial Metal Group had evolved, in the same general area, into the International Group (see Fig. 2 for sorne of the characteristic forms and their distributions). This Group, in turn, disappeared from the archaeological record by about 900-1000. It must be emphasized that the Initial and International Groups constitute a single une of development. The division between them, typological and chronological, is an arbitrary one, and the two groups may eventually have to be combined."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Several urban clusters have been found in the upper Buritaca that consist of collections of terrace groups, making it difficult to determine where a site begins and ends. Deep valleys cut one part of a settlement from another. The largest of the sites is Ciudad Perdida, built between 1,100-1,200 masl." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_CoTairo] Ciudad Perdida in the Upper Buritaca region.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"These figures fit well with the archaeological evidence from coastal and from highland regions for the existence of a three-level hierarchy of sites (Serje 1987; Oyuela Caycedo 1987b) in which the larger ones, such as Pueblito, have some 1,000 structures (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1954a: 161; 1954b; G. Reichel-Dolmatoff and A. Reichel-Dolmatoff 1955).Major towns, such as Bonda and Pocigueica, were governed by chiefs (caciques) and seem to have formed the nuclei of incipient states." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In a discussion about possible major settlements in earlier periods: "First, the conquerors never described the presence of large villages that had ample territorial control, as is the case for Bonda, Pocigueica, and Taironaca to provide a few of the best-known examples (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1951). Fray Pedro de Aguado (/1581/ 1906, 5:69) describes the '...towns of Concha and Ancones, where Jagua and Jairada, and Guachaca, and Nando, and Naguanje are, towns of principal lords, river ports and Ocean ports'. This reference would support the idea of communities of similar prestige, 'towns of principal lords', none of which would have preeminence over the others."  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"According to Groot (1985), and Cadavid and Groot (1987), the levels of architectural elaboration found at Ciudad Perdida vis-a-vis the other 25 settlements found in a 7 kilometer radius indicated that it was the center of political, social, and economic authority in the upper Buritaca river basin. They also suggest that Ciudad Perdida was home to an elite population comprised of civil and religious leaders, warriors, and specialists, with agricultural production concentrated in these satellite settlements (Groot 1985: 96). Though, their arguments are still unconfirmed and further research in these outlying settlements is still necessary, they did recognize in its fabric and texture, in the disposition of its buildings, paved pathways and staircases a number of characteristically urban qualities." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_CoTairo]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Atanque ♥</b> "Despite the evident ethnic and linguistic diversity, according to Bischof (1983, 1971) and 16th century sources (Indiferente General 1528 in Langebaek 2007: 44) a language called atanque was spoken by a majority of the indigenous population. Whether it was a lingua franca in use between the distinct ethnic groups in the surrounding area and these polities, or the most widespread language is still debated." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Even the sacred language of the Kogi mamas - called "Tairona" or teijua - includes Spanish or Latin words and is interpreted by Jackson (1995:68) as a relatively recent derivation of a little-known, more ancient tongue. Even language cannot necessarily be assumed to represent the ancient languages spoken by the inhabitants of the chiefdoms that the Spanish found." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_CoTairo]</div><div class='meatypart'></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Chibcha ♥</b> "Descendents of the original inhabitants still live in both regions. Linguistically, the descendents of the Sinú have lost their language, making it impossible to classify them in terms of known linguistic families (Adelaar and Muysken 2004). However, taking toponyms into consideration the area seems to have been occupied by Chibchan speakers. In the case of the SNSM, the various groups that still exist also belong to the Chibchan language family." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_CoTairo] "Constenla proposes that the language of different Sierra Nevada groups diverged 2200 to 1900 years ago, which is not far from the earliest radiocarbon dates (Constenla 1995: 47). But if that is so, and independent of the interest on the earliest origins of the Sierra Nevada's inhabitants, the whole cultural sequence described would refer to Chibcha language groups; this, it does not explain cultural change processes in the least, nor would it be wise to ingenuously explain the Tairona chiefdoms on the basis of cultural similarities with groups from whom they had separated thousands of years earlier."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The name Tairona is generally used in reference to the indigenous groups of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (a mountain range that stretches along Colombia's Caribbean coast) that came in contact with the Spanish in the sixteenth century, but it is also applied to the prehistoric societies that inhabited that same area, and which are mostly known through the artefacts they left behind.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_CoTairo] Santiago Giraldo and Juana Saenz have recently estimated that the prehistoric Tairona phase started around 1050 and ended early in the sixteenth century, based on radiocarbon-dated goldwork and complete dated contexts.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]At the time of the Spanish Conquest, the Tairona were organized into independent polities governed by a priestly class and a hierarchy of chiefs.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_CoTairo] Most likely, this system began to emerge between the eleventh and the twelfth centuries, as suggested by the appearance of several new ceremonial buildings, new spaces dedicated to feasting activities, a general overhaul of the layout of settlements, and evidence for the expansion and intensification of agricultural activities.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The population of a typical Tairona polity likely numbered in the hundreds of thousands, with conservative estimates of as much as 500,000 inhabitants. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_CoTairo] The largest settlements likely reached a population of a few hundred at the beginning of the Tairona phase, between a few hundred and 4,000 between the twelfth and the fourteenth centuries, and between 3,000 and 5,000 in the century immediately preceding the Spanish Conquest.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_REF_42_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_REF_43_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_REF_44_CoTairo]</div></body></html>
