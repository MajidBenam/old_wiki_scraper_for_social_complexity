But after A.D. 107/8, there was a sharp decline in the number of coins from other cities in circulation in Susa, at least insofar as they are represented in the finds at Susa, and Le Rider interprets this as a reflection of the decline in Susa's commercial importance."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_IrElym2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Trajan's advance sparked revolts in numerous cities in Mesopotamia, and it may be that shock waves from these events reached Susa also, because, as noted, there seems to have been a rapid decline in commercial activity and a cessation of the mint at Susa at about this time. Yet when Trajan died in Mesopotamia in A.D. 117 and his successors declined to pursue Roman interests there, Susa and the rest of Elymais seem - at least on the basis of numismatic evidence - to have been unable or unwilling to resume their independent roles."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_IrElym2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"decline of Susa as a commercial capital after about A.D. 100"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_IrElym2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 25-215 CE  ♥</b> [MAJIDBENAM_BR]Elymean settlement pattern 25-125 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_IrElym2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Elymais coined its own money, conducted its own public works programs, and in other was was apparently independent until about A.D. 215, when, documentary evidence suggests, the Parthian imperial government was once again in control at Susa."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_IrElym2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Trajan's advance sparked revolts in numerous cities in Mesopotamia, and it may be that shock waves from these events reached Susa also, because, as noted, there seems to have been a rapid decline in commercial activity and a cessation of the mint at Susa at about this time.

"Generally, opinion seems to be that small bronze coinages in these early historic empires served to facilitate the exchange of small amounts of goods and services. If this was the nature of Elymean trade, we might wonder that bronze coins appear to have been used extensively only in the period from about A.D. 75 to A.D. 210; why are Sasanian and Islamic occupations not marked with a similar frequency of coins at these rural settlements?"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_IrElym2] in addition to better economic fortunes "coins may also represent a greater degree of local autonomy and economic exchange in the period of their circulation."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_IrElym2]</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]21 CE Susa was under Parthian control because the Parthian monarch "validated a contested election at Susa."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_IrElym2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"the Parthian state was highly unstable, and Artabanus' death at about A.D. 40, in combination with financial and military reverses over the preceding decades, apparently weakened the Parthian state to the extent that it no longer issued an imperial coinage and successful revolts were staged at Seleucia-on-the-Tigris and other cities. At about this same time, it appears that Susa and its environs were incorporated into the 'satrapy' of Elymais (Fig. 6)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_IrElym2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ unitary state ♥</b>"Elymais' emergence as an independent state"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_IrElym2] 73 CE received a Parthian governor.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_IrElym2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The Greek city-states in Parthia were a survival from the Seleucid period.

A.D. 125) (figure 76) coincides with the rise of an autonomous Elymean state, incorporating Susa and most of the Susiana Plain. It is also apparently the period when Susa reached its zenith as an economic power. Coins dated to this period and minted at Seleucia and other major cities are frequently found at Susa, and Susa's own coinage is well represented at most large nearby cities (Le Rider 1965). During the 1973 survey, we found many coins of this era, even on tiny sites on the plain's periphery."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_IrElym2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Rural Susiana settlement patterns at this time indicate a considerable increase in population densities, vastly greater investents in irrigation systems, and the emergence of a ring of substantial settlements around Susa itself. Large investments were made to irrigate and cultivate marginally productive areas of the plain, and in a few locations the limits of traditional agricultural productivity were probably approached."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_IrElym2]</div></body></html>
