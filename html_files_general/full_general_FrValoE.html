Here we focus on the early Valois period, 1328-1450 CE, which was marked by the Hundred Years' War and the economic and human devastation caused by the Black Death. By the mid-15th century, the beginnings of a more modern bureaucracy had developed under Charles VII.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]In this period, the territory of the Kingdom of France was considerably smaller than that of modern France.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_FrValoE] The kingdom covered 390,000 square kilometres in 1350 and 340,000 square kilometres in 1450.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_FrValoE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In response to the decline in population and production during the Black Death in the mid-fourteenth century, the crown instituted harsh financial reforms and higher taxes. This led to revolts by peasants and in urban areas.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_FrValoE] At the same time, the Valois faced the English Plantagenet dynasty in the Hundred Years’ War (1337-1453 CE). The French suffered major defeats at Bruges (1340 CE) and Agincourt (1415 CE). Historian of France W. Scott Haine notes that, “In the darkest days of this war France’s very existence seemed in question.”[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_FrValoE]  In 1439 CE, inspired by the actions of peasant leader Joan of Arc, Charles VII of France instituted a professional standing army.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_FrValoE]  Charles VII conquered Normandy and Aquitaine by 1453 CE, and England only maintained control over Calais.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]We have estimated the population of the French Kingdom as 12 million in 1350 CE using data from Turchin and Nefedov’s <i>Secular Cycles.</i>[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_FrValoE] The population declined drastically during the Black Plague in the mid-fourteenth century.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_FrValoE] An estimated one-third of population died in the plague by 1400 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_FrValoE]  In 1450 CE, the population was only 9 million.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_FrValoE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The king and royal lineage dominated French political society. Others were divided into estates: the clergy, the nobles, and the common people.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_FrValoE] During the time of the Valois there were 40,000 noble families in France- nobility was either inherited or bestowed by the king.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_FrValoE] Charles VII (1422-1461 CE) began the process to modernize the crown- instituting reforms to change the government from feudal to bureaucratic. This was continued by Late Valois ruler Louis XI (1461-1483 CE).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_FrValoE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Valois Kingdom ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Valois_1400CE: 1328CE-1450CE ♥</b>  Valois_1400CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_FrValoE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  438654: 1328CE-1450CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Germanic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Old Frankish ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Christianity ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Catholicism ♥</b></div></body></html>
