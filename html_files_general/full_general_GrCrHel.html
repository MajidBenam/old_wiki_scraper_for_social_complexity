The most important city-states of the period were these of Knossos, Gortys, Kydonia and Lyttos.  Around these cities, a number of fragile unions of smaller cities was formed. None of these centers thought was seat of a political authority that controlled the island.

For much of this period, due to its enviable position in the Eastern Mediterranean, the island lay at the centre international conflicts between Alexander's successors, most notably the Ptolemies (who managed to establish an autonomous republic at Itanos in the third century[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_GrCrHel]), the Seleucids, Macedonia, and Pergamon.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_GrCrHel] This in turn exacerbated conflicts between the island's chief city-states, with few periods of respite, until Crete was conquered by the Romans[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_GrCrHel].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]In terms of the island's population at this time, estimates vary for a minimum of 200,000 to a maximum of 1,000,000 people; however, the most likely estimate is of 450,000-500,000 people.  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_GrCrHel] Political, military and religious control in Cretan city-states was exercised by the Kosmoi (<i>Κόσμοι</i>), a board of 3 to 10 nobles, annually elected by the Ecclesia, the body of free male citizens. One of the Kosmoi, known as protokosmos or stratagetas, was the president of the board. The council of elders, the Gerousia, whose members were chosen among the best Kosmoi, had legislative and juridical authority.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_GrCrHel][MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_GrCrHel]</div></body></html>
