The new leader of the bakufu was Yoshitoki's son, Yasutoki, by consensus the greatest of the Hojo regents. Born after the founding of the bakufu and educated in classical Confucianism, Yasutoki left a stamp on the regime's operations that survived until the end of the period. It was under Yasutoki that the bakufu's capacity for mediating disputes achieved new heights and under him also that Kamakura's reputation for good government became a fixture of the historical memory.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_JpKamak]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 1185-1333 CE ♥'</b>While most scholars of Japanese history agree upon names used to identify various periods, the dates specified for each era can vary a great deal. Generally, the years 1185-1615 are designated Japan’s medieval era, identified as such due to the advent of rule by the warrior class, feudal system of land allocation and administration, and characteristic political unrest.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_JpKamak] The Kamakura period is dated here from the Minamoto families victory in the Gempei War and ends with the over throw of the shogunate and the restoration of the Emperor.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ confederated state ♥</b> 'the core of the government was now a single lord-vassal group, spread rather thinly throughout the nation. Yoritomo rewarded his loyal vassals with estates and offices such as jito¯(steward) and shugo (protector or constable)... They also collected dues for the bakufu, and were entitled to retain a portion of the produce of the land for themselves. Through this system Yoritomo exercised a relatively direct control over much of Japan, and also further eroded the revenue of the noble court families and central government.'

The Kamakura period begins with the rise to power of Minamoto no Yoritomo who was granted the title of Shogun by the Emperor in 1192 legitimizing his role as de facto ruler of Japan.  'Mainly because of this need for legitimacy - but also partly because it has long been a practice in Japan to maintain some degree of continuity with the past amidst change - his government was a mixture of old and new. It became known as the bakufu (tent headquarters), a term used of the headquarters of commanders in the field, and in theory was merely the military arm of the imperial central government. The old central institutions were left largely intact, though weakened... Recent research has suggested that the court retained a greater vitality than previously believed, especially with regard to bureaucratic matters, and that religious institutions also played a significant role in the political world. In that sense, rather than simple warrior rule such as characterised the succeeding Muromachi period, it was perhaps more a case of cooperative rule during the Kamakura period.<i>[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_JpKamak]</i></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Japan - Kemmu Restoration ♥</b> (1333CE-1336CE)</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ none ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣ 0 ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Kyoto ♥</b> Kyoto was the official capital of the Japanese empire, and residence of the imperial family, from 794 until 1868.

In 1192 CE, Minamoto military victory received official recognition when Minatomo no Yoritomo was appointed shogun (great general) by the emperor.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_JpKamak] Although the emperor in Kyoto remained the nominal ruler, as the first shogun, Yoritomo managed to avoid court influence and intrigues by locating his base of operations close to his traditional support base in Kamakura, near present day Tokyo, from which the period takes its name.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_JpKamak][MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_JpKamak] The Kamakura Shogunate marks the beginning of Japan's medieval era, which saw the rise of warrior rule combined with a feudal system of landholding and administration.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_JpKamak] While the borders to the east, west and south remained roughly constant, the exact extent of the polity's territory to the north was not rigidly defined.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_JpKamak][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The 'peak' of the Kamakura Shogunate could be considered to coincide with the reign of the Hōjō regent Hōjō Yasutoki (r. 1224-1242 CE), who was responsible for institutionalizing the way the <i>bakufu</i> (military government) mediated disputes and governed.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_JpKamak] The period ends in 1333 CE with the overthrow of the shogunate and the restoration of the Emperor Go-Daigo.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_JpKamak][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The shogunate, also known as the <i>bakufu</i> (literally 'tent headquarters'), issued in a new period of military governance. However, many of the older institutions inherited from the Heian period persisted, albeit in weakened form.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_JpKamak] The degree to which the imperial court lost its power is still somewhat uncertain, and some scholars have argued that there was more cooperation between the court and shogunate than previously thought.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_JpKamak] The central political relationship now became that between the lord and his vassals: loyalty, either willing or enforced, formed the basis of governance.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_JpKamak] The shogun rewarded loyalty with grants of estates and offices. Vassals collected taxes but retained a portion, depleting the revenue of the central government. Warriors became the political, social and economic elite, drawing their economic power from their landholdings.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_JpKamak][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Echoing developments in the preceding Heian period, when imperial power was tempered by that of powerful regents, the shogun became functionally subordinate to hereditary regents from the Hōjō family (who lacked the necessary social rank to become shoguns in their own right) after the death of Yoritomo in 1199.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_JpKamak] In 1274 and 1281 CE, there were two failed Mongol invasions; this external threat may have helped to mute any internal dissent until the restoration of Emperor Go-Daigo.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_JpKamak][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The historian William Wayne Farris gives an estimate of between five and six million for the population of the Kamakura Shogunate.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_JpKamak]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Kamakura Shogunate ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Kamakura_1200CE: 1185CE-1299CE; Kamakura_1300CE: 1300CE-1333CE ♥</b>  Kamakura_1200CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_JpKamak] Kamakura_1300CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_JpKamak]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  301050: 1185CE-1299CE;  287470: 1300CE-1333CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Japonic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Japanesic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Middle Old Japanese ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Shinto ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Japanese State Shinto ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition ♣ Buddhism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religion Family ♣ Japanese Mayahana ♥</b></div></body></html>
