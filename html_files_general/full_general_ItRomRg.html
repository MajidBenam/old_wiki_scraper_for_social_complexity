[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_ItRomRg] In 2014, "The daily Il Messagero quoted Patrizia Fortini, the archaeologist responsible for the Forum, as saying that a wall constructed well before the city's traditional founding date had been unearthed." Examination of ceramic material found beside the wall suggested a date "between the 9th century and the beginning of the 8th century." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_ItRomRg][MAJIDBENAM_BR]First king of Rome may be Numa Pompilus (716-674 BCE) and a palace found on Palatine Hill dates to the late 8th century BCE.  But was Numa Pompilus really the first king? Romulus, the official founder, was mythical but could be representative of an earlier date (753 BCE?).[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Hellenisation of Latium began in the 8th Century. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_ItRomRg] This timeframe (730-580 BCE) was an “orientalising period” marked by increasing social stratification shown by burial evidence of wealth, armour and chariots. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_ItRomRg][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Not a peak date but a notable moment: the period of rule under Etruscan monarchs, beginning with Lucius Tarquinius Priscus from 616 BCE, saw a step-up in hierarchization of the Roman polity, and dates the moment when two groups known as patricians and plebians became more distinguishable. The first paving of the Roman Forum (meeting-place, market and civic centre) occurred around 625-575 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_ItRomRg] The first senate building, the Curia Hostilia, existed from about 600 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_ItRomRg] Monumental architecture was present from  the end of the 7th Century[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_ItRomRg] and included a sanctuary constructed in 580 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_ItRomRg] Etruscan monarchs were responsible for large building projects such as the Cloaca Maxima (sewer system), the Circus Maximus and in 535 BCE the last king Lucius Tarquinius Superbus (another Etruscan) built the Temple of Jupiter.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_ItRomRg][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Last king is Lucius Tarquinius Superbus (534-509 BCE). He was expelled from Rome by the aristocrats who set up Rome as a Republic.

Although there is archaeological evidence for the permanent occupation of Rome from the Iron Age 'centuries before' the city's mythic foundation date of 754 BCE,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_ItRomRg] perhaps from as early as 1000 BCE,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_ItRomRg] we have chosen to begin this polity in 716, with the traditional death date of the city's legendary founder Romulus.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_ItRomRg] The city prospered during this time, which saw the development of many of the institutions - political administration, legal system, religious practices - characteristic of the later Roman Republic. The last king, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus (534-509 BCE), was expelled from Rome for his and his family's tyrannical excesses. In his place, the leading Roman elites established an aristocratic city-state, ushering in the Republican period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_ItRomRg][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]By end of the Regal Period, Rome was a well-developed city-state, boasting civic infrastructure (marsh drainage, roads), political institutions (assemblies, Senate), monuments (temples), and a powerful military. It held at least one third of the area of Latium vetus (Old Latium)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_ItRomRg] and had a population of 20,000-50,000 people.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]According to legend, Rome became a city when the eponymous founder Romulus slew his twin brother Remus, both outcasts from a nearby Latium settlement, in a contest over where to found their new city. Numa Pompilius (r. 715-673 BCE), of Sabine origin, was the next king. Pompilius is traditionally credited with establishing 'all the major religious institutions of the state, including the calendar and the priesthoods'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_ItRomRg] Starting with Tarquinius Priscus (r. 616-579 BCE), Rome was ruled by a series of kings of Etruscan descent, who could thus draw on the legacy of this powerful and complex culture from north-central Italy (around modern-day Etruria). The Roman king served as chief legislator, military commander, highest judge and chief priest.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_ItRomRg][MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_ItRomRg] Archaeological remains found on the Palatine Hill dating to the late 8th century BCE suggest that the king lived in a palace from the earliest times. Rome's relationship with other settlements in Latium, particularly on military matters, were important.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_ItRomRg] The hereditary clan system (<i>gens</i>) formed the basis of the Roman nobility,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_ItRomRg] likely serving first as the king's advisors, although administrative structures gradually became more institutionalized (for example, through the establishment of a formal senate and voting assemblies) throughout the late 8th and 7th centuries BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The city of Rome, with a population somewhere between 14,000 and 57,000 during this period, fared well in military and economic terms. Several kings claimed important victories over nearby settlements in Latium and Etruria, expanding Rome's sphere of influence and establishing economic connections throughout central Italy. The Via Salaria ('salt road') and the Sacra Via in Rome were in existence from the beginning of the Roman Kingdom[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_ItRomRg] - although at this time the roads would not have been paved. A port known as Caere was situated 50 kilometres northwest of Rome.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_ItRomRg] The first bridge, thought to be the Pons Sublicius, may have been built in 642 BCE under Ancus Marcius.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_ItRomRg] Roman kings also reclaimed marshland and carried out drainage works.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_ItRomRg]</div></body></html>
