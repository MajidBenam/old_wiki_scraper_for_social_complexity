"Beginning A.D. 300-400, the bow replaced the atlatl in most regions" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_USMisRo][MAJIDBENAM_BR] In the Mississippian region (Midwest and Upland South) the transition from atlatl to bow was "relatively rapid because dart points disappear from the archaeological record" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_USMisRo][MAJIDBENAM_BR] Introduction of the bow in the Mississippi region decreased social complexity because it caused the collapse of the Hopewell system, the abandonment of mound centers and alliance-exchange relationships [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_USMisRo][MAJIDBENAM_BR] Bow enabled a new bow and native crops subsistence strategy which lead to a movement to and the effective exploitation of previously marginal lands and "household autonomy" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_USMisRo][MAJIDBENAM_BR] There followed an economic intensification and population growth which eventually "packed the landscape with settlements." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_USMisRo]</div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR] 400 CE[MAJIDBENAM_BR] 500 CE[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br>"The greatest environmental hazard would have been a late summer Mississippi River flood similar to the one that took place in 1993. A rise in the river at that time of the year simultaneously drowned crops, prevented easy fishing in shallow ponds, and ruined food stored in underground pits. Floods attributable to severe storms, including excessive water funnelled into the floodplain by creeks that drain the uplands, certainly caused localized disasters much like they did a century ago before effective flood-control measures were put in place." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_USMisRo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"No other major site was as advantageously situated. Cahokia was located in what was by far the widest expanse of land suitable for settlement in the American Bottom. More people could live there than anywhere else ... The high ground where Cahokia was located was bordered on the north and south by large tracts of low-lying land that received the waters of different upland streams."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_USMisRo]</div></body></html>
