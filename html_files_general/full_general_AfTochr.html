They are bordered in the south by Daxia (Bactria) and on the west by Anxi (Parthia). They are a nation of nomads, moving from place to place with their herds."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_AfTochr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The end of Yuezhi rule is marked by the seizure of power by the first Kushan king, Kujula Kadphises. We have no fixed date for this but Loeschner thinks it may have been as early as 20 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_AfTochr] In contrast, Osmund Bopearachchi gives a date of 40 CE for the start of Kujula Kadphises' reign.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_AfTochr]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ quasi-polity ♥</b>"Around 100 BCE the Yueh-chih conquered Bactria and drove the Scythians southwards to Gandhara. During the period 100 BCE to 40 CE, conditions in and around Bactria remained unsettled as the five factions of the Yueh-chih battled against each other for supremacy."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_AfTochr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Thus, both the written sources and the numismatic data show that Transoxiana in the 2nd and 1st centuries B.C.lacked internal political unity. Even Sughd (the basin of the river Zarafshan) was divided between at least two realms, this corresponding more or less to the later partition of the Zarafshan valley into "Bukharan Sughd" and "Samarkandian Sughd"; accordingly we have imitations of tetradrachms of Euthydemus and imitations of drachms of Antiochus I, with a horse's head on the reverse side."

The region was politically fragmented and the local settled populations were subjected to nomadic invasions, notably by a group of pastoralists and traders known to us by their Chinese name, Yuezhi.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_AfTochr][MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_AfTochr] The Yuezhi are also sometimes referred to as 'Tochari' by scholars who believe they spoke a Tocharian language, part of an extinct Indo-European language group.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_AfTochr] (Others argue that their original language was eastern Iranic or proto-Turkic.)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_AfTochr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the mid-1st millennium BCE and perhaps even earlier, the Yuezhi were living on the steppes to the north of China.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_AfTochr] However, after coming into conflict with other nomadic groups, the Xiongnu and Wusun, they migrated towards Sogdiana.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_AfTochr] By 129 BCE, when the Han Chinese diplomat Zhang Qian visited the Yuezhi court on the Oxus river, they were ruling over a region that included parts of the old Hellenistic Greco-Bactrian kingdom.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_AfTochr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the early 1st century CE, the first Kushan king, Kujula Kadphises, seized power and began ruling over south-eastern Sogdiana, marking the end of our Yuezhi period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_AfTochr] Kujula Kadphises was probably a member of one of five Yuezhi factions or subtribes, which he succeeded in unifying through military conquest,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_AfTochr] but even this is disputed.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Yuezhi in Bactria and Sogdiana seem to have been organized into a federation of five tribes that competed for political supremacy in the new territory.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_AfTochr] There is no written or numismatic evidence of a centralized Yuezhi state with a single paramount ruler before the rise of Kujula Kadphises.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_AfTochr] Historian Craig Benjamin has characterized Yuezhi control over the sedentary population of northern Bactria and Sogdia as that of a militarily superior ruling dynasty of nomads, 'pastoralist conquerors' whose 'nominal sovereignty' was acknowledged by the locals because they feared violence if they refused to submit.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_AfTochr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Secure estimates for the combined population of the ruling Yuezhi and the settled population under their control in this period are lacking.</div></body></html>
