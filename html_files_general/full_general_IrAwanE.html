The latter would eventually unit in a sort of federal system (especially in the following period). Among these various local entities, Susiana remains a unique case, due to its exposure to Mesopotamian influences."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_IrAwanE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]first half of third millennium saw rise of powerful city-states in southern Mesopotamia.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_IrAwanE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The conquest of Susiana [by Akkadians] also altered the confederate structure of the Elamite state."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_IrAwanE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Established in the late fourth millennium B.C., the Elamite Empire was the first Iranian experience in empire building and state tradition. ... the federated state of Elam practiced public administration ... The federal system of Elam was composed of several major kingdoms (the Kassite, the Guti, the Lullubi, Susiana, and Elamite), all being of the same racial group of the pre-Aryan people."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_IrAwanE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Akkadian conquest: "The conquest of Susiana also altered the confederate structure of the Elamite state."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_IrAwanE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Without exaggeration, the Elamite federated system of government can be considered as perhaps the earliest formal federalism on a large scale in history."

The agreement was between Naram-Sin and the king of Elam, who is recognised as a political and legal representative of Elam. However, it is true that, after these last attestations, the dynasty of Awan seems to have disappeared.

During his reign, however, the cuneiform writing of the Sumerians was adapted to fit the Akkadian language, and the resulting records have revealed Akkadian as the oldest known Semitic language.
