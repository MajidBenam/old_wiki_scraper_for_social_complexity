[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_PeCuzL2] Administrative and temple buildings at Qhapaqkancha, Markasunay and Pukara Pantillijlla probably developed during the Inca expansion into the Sacred Valley (1250-1310 CE). [MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_PeCuzL2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"A few centuries later, circa AD 1300, a second building phase was initiated at Choquepukio, resulting in the construction of additional niched halls." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_PeCuzL2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Carbon dates suggest that the transition from the pre-Inca to Inca eras at Chokepuquio seems to have occurred 1400 - 30, which is in keeping with the idea of a late incorporation of the Lucre region." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_PeCuzL2]"A particularly intriguing set of dates was taken recently from deposits at the site of Chokepuquio (McEwan and Gibaja O. n.d.). At this site, which was home to a major Inca foe in the Lucre basin late in the era of Inca state formation, a major burning event separated the pre-Inca from the imperial era. The reported suite of dates puts that event between 1400 and 1430 (with a 95 percent degree of confidence). If we accept the proposition that the conflagration occurred after the town fell to Inca forces, then we can infer that the Incas took control sometime early in the fifteenth century, not close to mid-century as the historical readings put it. " [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_PeCuzL2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Site surveys in the region lead Brian Bauer to conclude that the spread of Killke reflects early, gradual expansion of Inca hegemony that was nondisruptive. Thus, Killke Cuzco was apparently a young señorio, likely confederated with Chokepukio by about AD 1200." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_PeCuzL2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ quasi-polity ♥</b>Chroniclers say earliest rulers had a small territory and lacked control over neighbouring groups. Mayta Capac* consolidated Inca control over the Cusco Basin. Military hierarchy increased from these times. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_PeCuzL2] *(c1290 CE)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Incas employed both an indirect form of rule through local elites and a direct rule within provinces organized under a state administrator.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_PeCuzL2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Control was not territorially continuous, nor was it stable until the imperial period."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_PeCuzL2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ alliance ♥</b>Some alliances maintained by the Killke.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_PeCuzL2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The developing Inca polity is likely to have had direct control over, or close alliances with, some groups outside the Cuzco Valley even before it was completely consolidated." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_PeCuzL2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"alliance and hegemonic control were extended beyond the heartland region prior to the full implementation of direct control." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_PeCuzL2]Alliances with following groups (often preceded by warfare and ended with a marriage exchange):  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_PeCuzL2][MAJIDBENAM_BR] Anta (west)[MAJIDBENAM_BR] Ayarmaca (north west)[MAJIDBENAM_BR] Huayllacan (north)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Lucre polity also had alliances:[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The Pinagua-Moyna polity seems to have been the most powerful in the region before the reign of Inca Viracocha. These two groups jointly occupied the Lucre Basin and were likely the two moieties of a combined political unit. [...] Together with the Pinagua-Moyna alliance, the important settlements of Andahuaylillas, Huaro, and Urcos probably formed a powerful confederate mini-state, which was long able to prevent the Inca extension toward the east and Collao (Titicaca) region. It is noteworthy that these sites all contain the archaeological remains of major Wari occupations. This mini-state is very likely a fragment of the old Wari imperial structure." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_PeCuzL2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Possible alliance with other polities based at Tipón, Minaspata and Cotocotuyoc.

Both sources are compatible with the idea that, sometime after ad 1000, the Incas experienced 300 - 400 years of slow development from an incipiently hierarchical society into a nascent state."

"Up to this point, the predominant postcollapse cultural influence had been derived from the Wari. The second building phase seems to represent the arrival of an elite group from the old Tiwanaku sphere of influence." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_PeCuzL2] The Killke polity could also be linked to Lake Titicaca, since they appear to have been linguistically and genetically related. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_PeCuzL2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b>km squared. The extent of Tiwanaku influence in the Middle Horizon was 40,000 km squared [MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_PeCuzL2], so the later cultural influence of the Titicaca Basin could have been on a similar range or smaller.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Cuzco; Choquepukio ♥</b> 1000-1300 CE Cuzco became capital. This has been confirmed by archaeological digs under Cuzco. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_PeCuzL2]Choquepukio "was probably the principal town of the Pinahua, referred to as 'Pinagua-Chuquimatero' in the later documents."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_PeCuzL2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Language</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ [Aymara; Puquina] ♥</b> "Linguists have recently arrived at the view that the Incas may have adopted Quechua for imperial rule precisely because it was already widespread. Before then, the Incas spoke one or two other languages, most likely Aymara and possibly Puquina." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_PeCuzL2] This refers to the pre-imperial Inca or Killke. The language used in other polities, such as the Pinagua of the Lucre Basin, seems to be undocumented.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic Family ♣ Aymaran ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language Genus ♣ ♥</b><b>Religion</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious Tradition ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Family ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Sect ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b>[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_PeCuzL2][MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_PeCuzL2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The second and third maps are based on information in the chronicles of Cieza de Leon, Sarmiento de Gamboa, Cabello, Valboa, Murua, and Cobo. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_PeCuzL2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]This map [MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_PeCuzL2] represents all sites in the Lucre Basin, although not all of them are from the period considered (1300-1400 CE) they give an idea of the location of Choquepukio and adjacent sites.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]After the collapse of the Wari empire, the Cuzco valley once more underwent a phase of regionalization, known as the Late Intermediate Period (1000‒1476 CE).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_PeCuzL2] In other valleys of Peru, this period saw the emergence of complex kingdoms such as the Chimu, the Chincha, the Ischma and the Chanchay.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the Cuzco Valley, this period lasted from the early 11th century to the early 15th century and was characterized by incipient state formation in two areas. To the west, the Killke or K'illke  may have been the successors to the local Qotakalli chiefdoms of the Early Intermediate period and Middle Horizon.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_PeCuzL2][MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_PeCuzL2] Centred around the location of modern Cuzco, where Killke material has been excavated,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_PeCuzL2] their sphere of influence extended south of Cuzco for around 20 kilometres.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_PeCuzL2] Smaller undefended polities to the west of modern Cuzco may have been under Killke domination, while it is likely that the developing political units to the north were independent.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_PeCuzL2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the Lucre Basin to the east, another powerful cluster emerged, referred to as 'Pinagua' or 'Pinagua-Moyna' by ethnohistorians. These polities developed around the sites of Choquepukio, Cotocotuyoc and Minaspata.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_PeCuzL2] They may have upheld the cultural legacy of Wari colonizers from the Middle Horizon,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_PeCuzL2][MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_PeCuzL2] as their ceramics and architecture show profound Wari influence.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_PeCuzL2] Choquepukio in particular exhibits significant continuity with the Wari through its monumental architecture.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_PeCuzL2] Even further to the east, another small state may have existed around the settlements of Andahuaylillas, Huaro and Urcos. It has been suggested that the Pinagua cluster and these polities together prevented the eastern expansion of the Killke until the late 14th century.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_PeCuzL2] Between these two extremities of the Cuzco Valley, the Oropesa Basin acted as a buffer zone.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_PeCuzL2][MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_PeCuzL2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Killke, centred in the Cuzco region, appear to have been the most influential and expansionary of these cultures during the Late Intermediate Period: their ceramics were widely used, in contrast to the limited spread of Lucre Basin styles.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_42_PeCuzL2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Cuzco Basin and the Sacred Valley experienced significant population growth after 1000 CE,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_43_PeCuzL2] although population estimates are extremely difficult to produce.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_44_PeCuzL2] The Lucre Basin cluster comprised at least 4 settlements extending over 10 hectares (e.g. Minaspata and Coto-coto), and Choquepukio covered 60 ha. These settlements may have housed several thousand people each.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_45_PeCuzL2] The capital of the Killke polity, now buried beneath modern Cuzco, may have covered 50 ha.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_46_PeCuzL2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The second half of the Late Intermediate Period proved to be a gradual phase of consolidation for what would become the Inca Empire.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_47_PeCuzL2] Indeed, the Killke followed a pattern of 'leapfrogging', conquering new territories on an ad hoc basis.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_48_PeCuzL2] Administrative and temple buildings at Qhapaqkancha, Markasunay and Pukara Pantillijlla probably developed during the Inca expansion into the Sacred Valley (1250‒1310 CE).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_49_PeCuzL2] One suggested cause of this expansionary strategy is a period of drought between 1250 and 1310.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_50_PeCuzL2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Meanwhile, there was another phase of construction at the site of Choquepukio around 1300 CE, which may have corresponded to the arrival of a new elite group from the Titicaca cultural sphere.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_51_PeCuzL2] Our evidence for this incursion comes from DNA analysis as well as from the presence of <i>chullpas</i> (burial towers) and ceramic styles characteristic of the Altiplano.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_52_PeCuzL2] The construction of grand niched halls and the presence of luxury items made of ceramic, metal, precious stones, and bone  may indicate elite-sponsored feasting.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_53_PeCuzL2][MAJIDBENAM_REF_54_PeCuzL2] The paramount leader of Choquepukio may have held these feasts in order to establish his power in relation to other local elites.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_55_PeCuzL2] Early Inca chronicles document these Pinagua leaders or <i>capacs</i> as a rival force, blocking their expansion into the Lucre Basin.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_56_PeCuzL2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Archaeological evidence of a major burning event between 1400 and 1430 CE indicates that the Choquepukio state finally succumbed to Killke expansion.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_57_PeCuzL2] Choquepukio's arts and monumental architecture profoundly influenced the material culture of the Inca Empire:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_58_PeCuzL2] for example, Inca ceramics blended Lucre ceramic technology with Killke motifs.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_59_PeCuzL2] With the demise of the Choquepukio polity and the expansion of Killke dominance across the valley, the conditions were in place for the rise of the Inca Empire during the 15th century, creatively building upon the legacy of its predecessors.</div></body></html>
