The name derives from a Greek expression meaning 'burned faces'."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_EtAksm1] "The two terms Habashat and Ethiopia are paralleled in a trilingual inscription of Ezana, the king who converted to Christianity about EC 333, or AD 340.

What is less clear, however, is the nature of the relationship between Adulis and Aksum throughout this period. We know from both the Periplus and from material evidence that Aksum had begun to assert a growing influence on the region by the middle of the 1 st century CE (see Munro-Hay 1991; Phillipson 2000) - the Periplus describes "the city of the Axomite," through which the majority of the ivory traded at Adulis was transported."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_EtAksm1][MAJIDBENAM_BR] "a careful reading of the Periplus' Greek text, and a more general consideration of what is known from other sources about the growth of the Aksumite state, suggest that Zoscales' rule was probably restricted to the coastal region centred on Adulis. This interpretation is in accord with the attribution of RIE 277 to a ruler of a coast-centred kingdom during the first two centuries AD. While the Periplus mentions Zoscales in the context of Adulis-based trade, there is no indication that the port was his capital."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_EtAksm1] <i>RIE 277 is "Monumentum Adulitanum II ... a third-century Aksumite inscription erected at Adulis which, though now lost, was copied in the sixth century by Cosmas Indicopleustes."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_EtAksm1]</i></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none; alliance ♥</b> At least initially, the ruler of Aksum likely made alliances with other principalities both within the Horn of Africa and South Arabia (e.g. at some point, probably in this period?, the Aksumite kings claimed to be sovereign over the Himarites[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_EtAksm1]).

They refer probably to Mahrem, the dynastic and ethnic deity of the Axumites. In the 'pagan' bilingua of Ezana, the Mahrem of the Ethiopian text is given the Greek name, Ares. All the 'pagan' Greek inscriptions of the Axumite kings, with the exception of the Sembrythes' inscriptions in which the name of the god is absent, use the name Ares. As is well known, the Athenian Ares was worshipped as the god of war. It follows, then, that his double, Mahrem, was also worshipped as the god of war. In the Axumite inscriptions Ares-Mahrem, in his capacity of War-god, is termed 'invincible', 'unconquerable by his enemies' and ensuring victory. In is capacity as the ethnic progenitor, Ares is called the 'god of the Axumites' in the inscriptions from Abba-Pantalewon. As the dynastic deity, the kings called Mahrem-Ares their 'greatest god', ancestor of kings."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_47_EtAksm1]  "Plainly discernible in the religion of Aksum are the characteristic features of early class ideology, that of a feudal society in the process of formation. The Aksumites offered sacrifices to their gods. Domestic animals constituted the bulk of these offerings. One of Ezana's inscriptions records that a dozen oxen were offered up to Mahrem at a single sacrifice. According to ancient Semitic custom, some kinds of donation for sacrifice were brought in ritually immaculate clothing; for others this was not obligatory. But already in the pre-Aksumite period the living sacrificial animal was supplanted by its consecrated image. Bronze and stone images of sacrificial bulls, rams and other animals, many bearing inscriptions, have been preserved."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_48_EtAksm1] The south Arabian god Astar appears in a King Ezana inscription but none other of the earlier gods known in this time.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_49_EtAksm1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Sect ♣ ♥</b>An empire with Aksum as its capital dominated the northern highlands of Ethiopia from the first to the seventh century CE.
