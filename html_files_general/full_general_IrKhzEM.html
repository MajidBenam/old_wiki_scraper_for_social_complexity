Initially, it remained confined to the same area as Eridu and Hajji Muhammad, displaying a marked continuity in terms of settlement and pottery types. This led to the alternative periodisation of the Eridu, Hajji Muhammad, Early Ubaid, and Late Ubaid phases as Ubaid 1, 2, 3, and 4."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_IrKhzEM][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Crawford (2006)[MAJIDBENAM_BR] Hajji Muhammad pottery "is not confined to a single chronological phase and has no independent chronological existence."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_IrKhzEM][MAJIDBENAM_BR] "the admittedly flawed evidence from the three stratified sites discussed above illustrates convincingly the overlap between Hajji Muhammad and Eridu/Ubaid 1 wares on the one hand, and between Hajji Muhammad and Ubaid 3 pottery on the other."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_IrKhzEM][MAJIDBENAM_BR] Joan Oates showed pottery of Southern Mesopotamia known as Eridu, Hajji Muhammad, Ubaid 1 and Ubaid 2 related in linear evolution and re-named Ubaid 1-4. Late, an earlier phase Ubaid 0 was proposed for Tell el-'Oueili and a Terminal Ubaid or Ubaid 5 between the end of Ubaid 4 and the beginning of Uruk. Additionally, Ubaid 3 is often subdivided into phases a and b. "The whole sequence is now thought to cover the mid-sixth to mid-fifth millennia."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_IrKhzEM][MAJIDBENAM_BR] "The stratigraphic evidence we have quoted from South Mesopotamia, the Hamrin, southwest[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Iran, and the Gulf is far from satisfactory, but there is now enough of it to be able to raise serious doubts about the status of Hajji Muhammad ware as the marker of a separate chronological period. Instead, we should probably now see it as defining the later part of the Ubaid 1 period and the early stages of the Ubaid 3 period. There is, as yet, no instance in which it is the only pottery style found in a stratigraphic context."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_IrKhzEM][MAJIDBENAM_BR] "if our pottery has no independent chronological existence, it must mean that Ubaid 1 on the one hand, and Ubaid 3 on the other, had a longer life than previously thought and that the rate of change was therefore slower than is currently accepted."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_IrKhzEM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ quasi-polity ♥</b>Hajji Muhammad ware: "The proposed usage for formal eating and drinking made them a desirable item for display purposes in a society that was, perhaps, beginning to see the emergence of a social hierarchy."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_IrKhzEM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Susiana A ♥</b> "the admittedly flawed evidence from the three stratified sites discussed above illustrates convincingly the overlap between Hajji Muhammad and Eridu/Ubaid 1 wares on the one hand, and between Hajji Muhammad and Ubaid 3 pottery on the other."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_IrKhzEM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b> "it is evident that 'Ubaid developed out of Hajji Muhammad just as the latter is derived from Eridu. This continuity of cultural evolution has led certain scholars to simplify the sequence into ' Ubaid 1-4, Eridu being ' Ubaid I, Hajji Muhammad 'Ubaid 2, etc., against the better judgement of the excavators. As it tends to obscure the links of these two early cultures with Susiana and favours the theory of autochthonous development (which can no longer be maintained, in view of the recent discoveries at Ali-Kush and Tepe Sabz), the alternative system may have to be rejected."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_IrKhzEM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Susiana - Early Ubaid ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣  ♥</b>[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_IrKhzEM][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Archaic period: 6300-5200 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Susiana in sixth-fifth millennium: "In all respects, Susiana was large and rich enough to sustain a vigorous indigenous culture in parallel with, and separate from, that of Mesopotamia."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_IrKhzEM][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Hajji Muhammad culture ca. 5800-5100 BCE - lower Mesopotamia and at least part of Susiana.

This was the initial phase of Ubaid culture, through which lower Mesopotamia would eventually take the lead in terms of technological and organisational development in the Near East. ... In terms of periodisation, the rise of Ubaid culture marks the end of the Neolithic and the beginning of the Chalcolithic period."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_IrKhzEM][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Architecture and organization of space within a typical village is difficult to reconstruct. Most sites have been explored through limited exposures, and have not yielded coherent architectural plans (see Hole 1987a: 40). The only exception to this is the site of Jaffarabad located on the Susiana plane approximately 7 km north of Susa. During the Early Chalcolithic, this site consisted of an agglomeration of domestic mud brick structures made up of large long halls flanked by smaller rooms (Dollfus 1975: 18 and figures 6-7). One hall had an area of 11.5 x 3.15 m. Some of the domestic complexes had buttressed walls. Almost no open space existed between these structures. The artifacts recovered from the domestic complexes reflect normal domestic activities. The presence of kilns and wasters are the only evidence for craft production at the site (Dollfus 1975)."
