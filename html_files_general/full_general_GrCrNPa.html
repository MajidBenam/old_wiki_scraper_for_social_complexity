[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_GrCrNPa] The high degree of homogeneity characterizing the material culture of the period has been interpreted as indicative of a large, island-wide integrating political  structure - that was argued to be Knossos - with dependent political centers emulating the "capital."  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_GrCrNPa] Recent studies, however, have shown that the evidence, on which the theory of the assumed Knossian hegemony was based, is insecure. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_GrCrNPa]  Knossos was the most important cultural and ideological centre of Crete, but not its administrative “capital”.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> Information of the spoken and written language of Bronze Age Cretans during the Neopalatial period is scant due to the limited number of written documents. The few preserved documents were written in Linear A script which is still undeciphered. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_GrCrNPa] What language was recorded in Linear A documents is an issue of vivid debate. Some consider it part of the eastern family of Indo-European languages and have attempted to connected it to Luwian or Hittite while others connected to Semitic, Phoenecian, Indo-Iranian, or Tyrrenian. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_GrCrNPa] It is  possible however that Linear A express a pre-Hellenic  Aegean linguistic substrate "which was enriched over time throughout possible migrations to the island, as well as various extra-Cretan contacts with other linguists elements, including Greek world. Thus, we could speaking of an age-old indigenous 'Minoan' language that survived in some parts of Crete until the first millennium B.C. and appears as "Eteocretan" on inscriptions such as those from Praisos and Dreros." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_GrCrNPa]</div><div class='meatypart'></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ ♥</b>Crete is a large island in the Eastern Mediterranean. Here we consider the phase of its history best known as the Neopalatial Era. This period followed a series of conflagrations at the end of the Old Palace era (1700 BCE), which affected almost all Cretan sites. Little agreement exists about the causes of these destructions. Although it has been generally argued that these were possibly caused by earthquake, the senario of  war conflicts among major political centers of the period cannot  be excluded. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_GrCrNPa][MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_GrCrNPa] The Neopalatial era ended, in 1450,  in a similar way to the previous phase: the central complexes (except for the one at Knossos), many important buildings and whole settlements were violently damaged by fire and abandoned, and the Cretan presence in the Aegean and the Near East came to an end. The causes of these destructions have also been a topic of vivid debate: a massive natural disaster (earthquake), war, internal disruption or system collapse have all been suggested as possible explanations [MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_GrCrNPa], though perhaps human rather than natural causes are more likely[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_GrCrNPa].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Population and Political Organization[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Some scholars argue that, during the Neopatial period, the island was divided into small independent "states" centered upon large monumental complexes generally known as "palaces"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_GrCrNPa][MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_GrCrNPa][MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_GrCrNPa][MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_GrCrNPa] Others favour the notion of a Knossian hegemony, that is, the notion that Crete was politically unified under the control of the ruler at Knossos[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_GrCrNPa][MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_GrCrNPa][MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_GrCrNPa] Yet other have favored the idea of independent political formations emulating Knossos[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_GrCrNPa][MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_GrCrNPa][MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_GrCrNPa][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The population of Crete at this time has been estimated at 242,000[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_GrCrNPa], 216,000-271,000[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_GrCrNPa] and 260,000[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_GrCrNPa]. As for Knossos, the largest urban centre in the whole of Prehistoric Greece, Whitelaw estimated Knossian population to 25,000-30,000 people replacing his previous estimate of 14,000-18,000 individuals[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_GrCrNPa][MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_GrCrNPa]</div></body></html>
