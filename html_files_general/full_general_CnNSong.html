The government was headed by a powerful emperor and featured a large central bureaucracy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_CnNSong][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Song period saw rapid commercial and industrial expansion.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_CnNSong] Agriculture, paper-making, printing, and iron-working flourished,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_CnNSong][MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_CnNSong] and paper money was first produced in China under the Song.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_CnNSong] Foreign trade increased as the state expanded its trading networks.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_CnNSong][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Although it is clear that the Song Dynasty was a period of massive population growth and urbanization,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_CnNSong] there is some disagreement about exact population numbers. Some scholars agree that the population had reached around 100 million by 1000 CE,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_CnNSong][MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_CnNSong] while others believe it was closer to 60 million.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_CnNSong]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Song Dynasty ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Song_1000CE: 960CE-1099CE; Song_1100CE: 1100CE-1127CE ♥</b>  Song_1000CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_CnNSong] Song_1100CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_CnNSong]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  2559977: 960CE-1099CE;  2509839: 1100CE-1127CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Sino-Tibetan ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Sinitic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Chinese ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Confucianism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Imperial Confucianism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition ♣ Buddhism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religion Family ♣ Chinese Buddhism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition2 ♣ Daoism ♥</b></div></body></html>
