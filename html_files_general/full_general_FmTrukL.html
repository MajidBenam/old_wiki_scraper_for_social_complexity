It and the surrounding atolls form one of the four states of the Federated States of Micronesia, which were part of the U.S. Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_FmTrukL] 'Lying between 7 degrees and 7 minutes and 7 degrees and 14 minutes north latitude and 151 degrees and 22 minutes and 152 degrees and 4 minutes east longitude, Chuuk is a complex atoll: a circle of reefs and about 40 low coral islets enclosing a lagoon of 48 to 64 kilometers in diameter and, within it, 17 high islands of volcanic origin, with a total land area of 86 square kilometers. There are two major seasons, a dry one with northeast trade winds from November to June and a wet one with light winds from the south and southwest.'

In the fourteenth century, a cult center was established on Moen Island. It was abandoned in the eighteenth century following a fresh immigration from neighboring atolls. Japan replaced Germany as the ruling power in World War I and was in turn replaced by the United States under United Nations Trusteeship in 1945. In 1986 Chuuk and its surrounding atolls became a state within the newly independent Federated States of Micronesia. Protestant missionaries and traders came in the 1880s and Roman Catholic missionaries after 1900. Japan sought to develop Chuuk economically and introduced elementary education in Japanese. Education was much expanded under American administration, and many Chuukese learned English. Some went to college in Guam, Hawaii, and the United States mainland. The American administration introduced representative government.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_FmTrukL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ loose ♥</b> The colonial governments appointed a number of head-chiefs and superimposed a colonial administration onto the native system: 'In 1904 the disarming of the Truk people was undertaken by the “Kondor.” There were 436 guns and 2,531 cartridges confiscated. For better control the government appointed six head-chiefs, banished some swashbucklers who did not want to submit, and turned out the Japanese. With this a peaceful development was initiated. The missions (Protestant mission since 1879, Catholic mission since 1912) were able to work undisturbed. Unfortunately, the German government took little notice of Truk, since it was too preoccupied with the other islands. Yet many things were accomplished. Under the last director of the station, A. Überhorst, the lagoon was given new impetus in every respect. The relationship between officials and the population was usually a good one, under Mr. Überhorst even a cordial one. Anyone who was on Truk in those years certainly did not see any bad treatment of the natives. Much was done also with regard to health; in particular Dr. Mayer and his wife traveled from island to island without rest in order to take care of the sick. If during the Japanese occupation a young naval officer was not ashamed to assert that the Germans had done nothing for the islands, anyone who lived on the islands during the Japanese period can only say from the heart: “God protect the poor Truk people under the Japanese.”' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_FmTrukL] Head-chiefs or island-chiefs resolved disputes that could not be settled on the village level: 'The Germans set up a single chief over each island, or in Truk proper, over each large island with its satellites. One of the functions of this single chief was to settle such land disputes as could not be settled at the village level in order to prevent the outbreak of intra-island warfare.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_FmTrukL] In the Japanese period, schooling was introduced, producing a small Chuukese elite of petty officials: 'The purpose of the schools for natives, judging from both reported policies and the Japanese school regulations was to civilize the natives and make them into loyal and economically useful citizens of the Japanese empire. While there was theoretically no limit to the higher education which the native child with sufficient ability and financial support might obtain, in actual fact only a minority of Trukese children attended the fourth and fifth grades, and only a minority of those completing fifth grade obtained further education at the vocational schools. Apparently no Trukese native obtained any academic education beyond fifth grade, except incidentally along with vocational training. The system was geared in effect to produce a supply of general laborers and domestic servants who understood the Japanese language, plus a small elite of skilled laborers and petty officials.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_FmTrukL] Fischer also speaks of 'magistrates' and village chiefs, although their relationship to the above categories is somewhat unclear: 'The chiefs who receive these food presentations and feasts may not be the elected magistrates. If the magistrates happen to be also hereditary village chiefs, they receive such presentations, but only from their own village and not from the whole island. Most islands, even the outer islands, have at least two villages, and the larger island of Truk has a dozen or so each. Usually the village chief is a member of the chiefly clan who has been chosen for personal ability and not for seniority. This tendency is by no means universal.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_FmTrukL] Expert feedback on this is needed.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ vassalage ♥</b> SCCS variable 84 'Higher Political Organization' is coded 'Absent', not 'Peace group', 'Alliances', 'Confederation', 'International organization'.

Dublon is less than half the size of Moen, but it was selected as the first seat of government because of its superior ship anchorage, particularly for sailing vessels. The American military government relocated the administrative headquarters from Dublon to Moen soon after the formal Japanese surrender in 1945 because of the large amount of unexploded ordnance that remained on Dublon. Hence, Moen’s history as a port town island dates back only a little over 40 years.'

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_FmTrukL]</div><div class='meatypart'></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Oceanic-Austronesian ♥</b>  There is great linguistic diversity in Micronesia: 'Although it is clear that people first settled Micronesia about 3,500 to 2,000 years ago, archaeological investigations there have been limited by the difficulty of excavating on small densely populated islands whose landscape has often been disturbed by storms. As a result, language rather than archaeology has provided the most insight into the history of early settlement. For example, the languages of eastern and central Micronesia are closely related to Austronesian languages that exist to the southeast in Melanesia. The languages spoken in the west, specifically those of Palau, the Marianas, and Yap, are closely related neither to those in the east nor to one another. These islands on the western edge of Micronesia seem to have been settled from the Philippines and Indonesia. The large number of mutually unintelligible Micronesian languages is a sign of the region’s great cultural diversity. The following islands have mutually unintelligible languages: Nauru, the Gilberts, the Marshalls, Kosrae, Pingelap, Mokil, Pohnpei, Ngatik, the Mortlocks, Chuuk, the Puluwat area, the Woleai area, Yap, Palau, and the Marianas. The languages of the islands from the Marshalls and the Gilberts through the Woleai area in the above list appear to be more closely related to each other than to the remaining languages and have been referred to as “nuclear Micronesian.” The languages of Palau, Yap, and the Marianas are relatively distinct from each other and from other Micronesian languages, although they are clearly Austronesian in their general affiliation. The Chamorro language, spoken in the Marianas, has undergone much influence from Spanish and probably also from the Philippine Tagalog language after more than four centuries of Western contact.'

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_FmTrukL] The name Chuuk, meaning "high mountains", comes from the Chuukese language. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_FmTrukL] The islands' first contact with Europeans came in 1528, when they were sighted by Spanish explorers. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_FmTrukL] In the late 19th century, the Chuuk islands became part of Spanish and German, then Japanese colonial regimes. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_FmTrukL]. After the Second World War, where the islands were a major site of conflict in the Pacific Theater, the Chuuk islands became part of the UN Trust Territory of the Pacific under US administration. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_FmTrukL].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]During the pre-colonial period, Chuuk was extremely fragmented politically. Each district had its own chiefship, which was divided between the "oldest man in the senior female line in the chiefly lineage and the oldest man in the lineage generally." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_FmTrukL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]During the colonial period, the colonial governments superimposed a colonial administration onto the native system. They appointed head chiefs to lead each of the main Micronesian islands, but the individual communities remained fragmented. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_FmTrukL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The only available population figures refer to the colonial period. In 1947, Chuuk's population was about 9,200.
