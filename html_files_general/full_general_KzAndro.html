The largest was in the desert on the lower Zeravshan at Karnab (Uzbekistan), about 170km west of Sarazm, exploiting cassiterite ores with a moderate tin content ... The potter and radiocarbon dates show that the Karnab mine was worked by people from the northern steppes, connected with the Andronovo horizon ...

Similar subsistence strategies - sheep and cattle herding combined with small-scale arable farming - were employed and evidence of a shared pottery style has been found. There was also a tradition of metallurgy that included the mining and use of copper, tin and gold and the manufacture of bronze, which was exchanged within interregional trade networks.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_KzAndro][MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_KzAndro][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Little is known about the social or political organization of Andronovo communities.
