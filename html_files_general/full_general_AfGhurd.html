During their rise, the Ghurids patronized the Karramis, a Sunni pietistic sect whose founder, Muhammad b. Karram (d. 869), helped convert the recalcitrant Ghur from paganism to Islam. A spectacular four-volume leather- bound Qur’an produced for sultan Ghiyath al-Din in 1189, the sole manuscript that can be associated with Ghurid patronage, may have been commissioned as a bequest to a Karrami madrasa. In addition, it seems likely that the complex epigraphic program of the most spectacular example of Ghurid architectural patron- age, the roughly 220-foot-high brick minaret at Jam in central Af- ghanistan, was chosen to rebut contemporary criticisms that the Karramis were anthropomorphists. [...] In 1199, at the zenith of their political power, the Ghurid sul- tans broke with the Karramis, aligning themselves with the more transregional Hana  and Shaf‘i law schools of Islam instead. The realignment can be correlated with increased cultural and diplo- matic contacts with the Baghdad caliphate, especially during the lengthy reign of the Abbasid caliph Nasir (r. 1180-1225). This “international turn” was also re ected in the introduction of new coin types in the Ghazni mint in 1200, which linked the Ghurids more directly with their Sunni contemporaries in the wider Islamic world."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_AfGhurd]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Genus ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion ♣ ♥</b>The Ghurids were an Islamic Turkish dynasty that ruled the Persian Principality of Ghur between 1025-1215 CE. The peak of their power occurred with their defeat of the Ghaznavid Empire in 1186 CE. For the majority of its existence the Ghurid rulers were in a state of vassalage of the Ghaznavids and the sultans of the Seljuk Turks, to whom they sent tribute.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_AfGhurd][MAJIDBENAM_BR]While "the early history of the Sansabani family had been full of feuds and disputes" the successful rebellion against the Ghaznavids resulted in a legacy of at least a degree of cooperation.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_AfGhurd] Bosworth (2012) talks of a polity with two power-bases: one at the newly-acquired Firuzkuh, at Gazna; the other at Bamian.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_AfGhurd][MAJIDBENAM_BR]When Mo'ezz-al-Din, conquered Gazna he took the title of sultan.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_AfGhurd] Government was based on the Persian model with a professional vizier who oversaw civil affairs.
