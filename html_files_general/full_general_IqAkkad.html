Agade refers to the city and Akkad to theland, but in antiquity the same word was used for both."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_IqAkkad] This period is also called Sargonic Period and the name came from the founder of Akkad and the whole ruling dynasty - Sargon (Sharrukin). His descent is unclear and there are many legends regarding his family. One of them is telling that his mother was a priestess and Sargon did not know his father. Another one says he was a gardener and beloved of goddess Istar who gave him Sumer to rule. There is also information that he was a cup-bearer in the palace of Kish's king - Ur-Zababa and he came to power thanks palace revolt. Sargon quickly conquered whole Sumer and control whole Mesopotamia, however his brutal and ruthless methods (which were later absorbed by his descendants), such as capturing defeated kings and governors, destroying city walls and looting conquered area did not brought him popularity and sympathy of Sumerians and other inhabitants of Mesopotamia. That partially explained frequency and intensity of internal rebellions against Sargon and Sargonid dynasty.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_IqAkkad][MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_IqAkkad][MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_IqAkkad]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Peak Date ♣ 2190-2154 BCE ♥</b> the reign of Naram-Sin[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_IqAkkad]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 2270-2083 BCE ♥</b> according to short chronology.

Therefore, they undertook several reforms such using Akkadian in official calculation, set the officials and governors which will be dependent on them etc.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_IqAkkad][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Akkadian Empire: "It was an entity put together and maintained by force, with provinces administered by officials sent out from the capital in the heartland. This is precisely what we see in the Akkadian period."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_IqAkkad][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Akkaddian empire can be divided into centre and periphery. "In the centre, Akkadian control was exercised in a compact, yet indirect way. The administration of cities was left in the hands of the local ensi. These were under the authority of the king of Akkad, but held a certain degree of autonomy. It is probably that some cities were ruled by an Akkadian ensi appointed by the king, while other cities continued to be ruled by a local ensi."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_IqAkkad]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ alliance ♥</b>Dynastic marriage practiced, which was "attested first at pre-Akkadian Ebla". e.g. to royal family at Urkesh.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_IqAkkad]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Lagash Dynasty ♥</b> I Lagash dynasty</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ cultural assimilation; continuity ♥</b> "We know now that Semitic people were already present in Mesopotamia in the Early Dynastic period. Therefore, they did not settle in the region after a mass immigration."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_IqAkkad] The relation to preceding polity is complicated. Sargon, was an Akkadian and he was probably cup-bear in the palace of Ur-Zababa, king of Kish. The Akaddians were earlier present component of cultural and ethic map of Sumer and the region of Babilon, but they did not play any important political role. Sargon was a person who united the Akkadian people and provided the privilege when he conquered Sumer.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_IqAkkad]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Gutian Dynasty ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b>km squared.

During his reign, however, the cuneiform writing of the Sumerians was adapted to fit the Akkadian language, and the resulting records have revealed Akkadian as the oldest known Semitic language. Cuneiform spread with the empire and was adopted in other states, including the kingdom of Elam, located to the west of Akkad."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_IqAkkad] "Therewas no requirement that records be kept in a specific language; in Sumer they tended to be in Sumerian, though written in the new Akkadian script, whereas in Akkad, they tended to be in Akkadian.

Map 2. p.81 Foster (2016)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_IqAkkad][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The polity at Akkad in Iraq is often thought to represent the "first world empire".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_IqAkkad][MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_IqAkkad] Its name derives from city of Akkad (Agade, location still undetermined), which was a capital of the kingdom. The period is also called Sargonic Period after the founder of Akkad and the ruling dynasty - Sargon (Sharrukin). The end of Akkadian empire seems to be associated with the invasion of the Gutians, and is correlated with some climate changes.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_IqAkkad][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Sargon's power mainly depended on his army, which was probably a regular standing army.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_IqAkkad] Foster (2016) describes an Empire as "an entity put together and maintained by force, with provinces administered by officials sent out from the capital in the heartland" and claims this is "precisely what we see in the Akkadian period."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_IqAkkad] Barjamovic (2012) notes that the formation of the private royal army and the construction of regional military strongholds together with the division of the conquered territories into provinces was the key to Akkad's "permanent imperial presence."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_IqAkkad][MAJIDBENAM_BR]To increase control from the center, Sargon appointed Akkadian governors (ensi) in Sumerian cities in a place of older Sumerian rulers[MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_IqAkkad] although some cities continued to be ruled by a local ensi.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_IqAkkad] In fact, all local officials probably had a great deal of de facto independence.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_IqAkkad] As an additional means of control, Sargon sent his daughter -  Enheduanna - to be the highest priestess of god Sin in Uruk. This practice was continued by his descendants.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_IqAkkad][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Naram-Sin, a grandson of Sargon, was one of the greatest ruler of Akkad in terms of military conquest and administration. His reforms included a unified system of measurements. He undertook also the process of renovation of Ekur temple and on his death was deified and treated as protective deity.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_IqAkkad] Akkadian was the official language of empire, and all official documents were written in Akkadian, although Sumerian still was in use, especially in Southern Mesopotamia.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_IqAkkad]</div></body></html>
