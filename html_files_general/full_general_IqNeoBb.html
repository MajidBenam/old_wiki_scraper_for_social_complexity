While his father Nabopolassar was on the throne, Nebachudrezzar went on campaigns to defeat the Assyrian and Egyptian armies.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_IqNeoBb] Having succeeded in creating the Neo-Babylonian empire, he returned to Babylon to be crowned. Nebachudrezzar then undertook a period of building creating some of the most iconic Babylonian architecture. He ruled the Neo-Babylonian empire by enforcing tithes of goods and labour, although some of the most distant Levantine city-states had a deal of autonomy. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_IqNeoBb] So the empire continued for several decades until the reign of Nabonidus, whom is presumed to be unpopular. He left Babylon for ten years to live in the desert. Cyrus of the Achaemenid empire subsequently took over Babylon. Some say he was welcomed to depose Nabonidus, other evidence suggests he destroyed the city. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_IqNeoBb][MAJIDBENAM_BR]At the height of it's power in the Neo-Babylonian Empire, Babylon was given resources to become the centre of the known world for culture, learning and religion.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The audience of Babylonian documents appears to be the Babylonian nobles and priesthood, therefore, they mostly celebrate building projects. It is thought that the empire had reached it's natural limit within ten years; with the Medians to the north and east, the Egyptians in the south-west and the desert to the south. Therefore, the threatening military literature that pervaded the Neo-Assyrian empire was not needed in the Neo-Babylonian empire. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_IqNeoBb] As a result, less is known about the military capabilities of the Neo-Babylonian empire.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The major historical events do not appear to have significantly impacted the material culture. There is continuity in form and style through the Achaemenian transition.
