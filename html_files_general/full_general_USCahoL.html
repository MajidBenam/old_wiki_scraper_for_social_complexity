Milner estimates that by the Morehead phase the Cahokia (city) population had fallen about 40% from the Lohmann peak.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_USCahoL] The settlement pattern was still of nucleated clusters of houses[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_USCahoL] between which were structures "with special ritual and social significance."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_USCahoL] At its height about 15,000 lived in an area called the 'central administrative complex'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_USCahoL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Many archaeologists are skeptical whether there was a ruler king at Cahokia[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_USCahoL]  the polity more likely led by a "a priesthood or a group of ruler-priests"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_USCahoL] within a social strata that included included chiefs, sub-chiefs, elders, priests, and other religious functionaries."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_USCahoL] Whilst most Cahokians were self-sufficient granaries were also present.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_USCahoL] The Cahokians were capable of feats of organization that included the famous Monks Mound and other mounds which required moving 1.1 million m3 or earth and a 15m high wooden palisade that ran for nearly 3km.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_USCahoL]</div></body></html>
