At this time "the Kassite dynasty ranked among the major powers of the Near East", the Amarna letters describe describe "diplomatics marriages and large scale trade" between the Kassites and Egypt, the super-power of the time. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_IqBabKs]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 1595-1150 BCE ♥</b>1595 BCE - The date of the fall of the First Dynasty of Babylon to the Hittites. By default this is taken as the start of the Kassite Dynasty (as the next rulers of Babylon), although whether this reflects the true start of the Kassite dynasty in unknown. For example, there is a 200 year gap between the last cylinder seals of the First Dynasty and the first of the Kassite Dynasty. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_IqBabKs][MAJIDBENAM_BR]1150 BCE - The Elamites invaded Babylonia in 1154 BCE [MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_IqBabKs] and put their own king, Kutir-Nahunte, on the throne. Kutir-Nahunte soon conquered the whole of Babylon, defeated the Kassites and returned to Elam with some of their most precious icons, including the victory stele of Naram-Sin and the god statue of Marduk. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_IqBabKs]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ confederated state ♥</b> There was a large influx of foreigners and hill people in the Kassite period. Together with the tribes, which inhabited their own provinces, this caused a lack of centralisation in the Kassite period when Babylon was largely de-urbanised [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_IqBabKs] and the more rural, tribal communities existed in a kind of feudal state.

In the Amarna letters the Kassite king Burnaburiash II (1359-1333 BCE) described Assyria as his vassal. By the reign of the Assyrian king Tulki-Ninurta I (1243-1207 BCE), Assyria had grown powerful enough, in the vacuum created by the decline of the Mitanni, to invade Babylon. When Tulki-Ninurta I's son overthrew him, the Kassites returned to claim the Babylonian throne again.

The Hittites did not establish their presence in Babylonia and, instead, the Kassite elites took the throne and ruled over Babylonia. There was some migration of Kassite people, but mostly the elites gained control and assimilated into Babylonian society.

The Hittites did not establish their presence in Babylonia and, instead, the Kassites took the throne and ruled over Babylonia, although it was a smaller empire than the First Empire.  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_IqBabKs] The Kassite Dynasty is notable for the unification of Sumer and Babylon to create the Empire. It was marked by large building projects, especially in old Sumerian cities such as Ur, Uruk and Eridu. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_IqBabKs] The Babylonian Empire was at this time secondary to the powerful surrounding states Egypt and Assyria. The Kassites had a reasonably good relationship with Egypt; there were several intermarriages and gifts were given and recieved. On the other side, they constantly fought with Assyria until  the Assyrian king Tukulti-Ninurta I captured the Babylonian king, Kashtiliash IV and conquered Babylon. Assyrians ruled Babylon for seven years. Elam also started invading Babylonian territory in the latter Kassite Dynasty, eventually setting Kutir-Nahhunte on the throne in the north, leaving the Kassites surviving in power in the south. Not many years later Kuti-Nahhunte conquered the whole of Babylon, ended the rule of the Kassite Dynasty and took their god, Marduk, to Susa. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_IqBabKs][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The period was characterised by the overall population decline occurring across the Near East. Border towns and villages were abandoned and irrigation became less successful. Much of the administration was undertaken by or in the temples who effectively owned most of the land; however, another type of land ownership developed, which was the land gifted by the king to religious, military and administrative elites. The non-elites, on the other hand, suffered during this period, becoming markedly impoverished as they became unimportant in social government. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_IqBabKs][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In general, the Kassites made only limited changes to Babylonian culture, mostly assimilating into Babylonian society. As such, it can often be difficult to ascribe evidence to the Kassites specifically, as opposed to the ongoing Babylonian empire.
