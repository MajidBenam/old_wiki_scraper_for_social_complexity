The Central Capital was situated near the Shira Muren River inflow point to Liao River. These are zones of residence of Kitans and other pastoral nomads of empire. The East Capital was near city of Liao-yang in the area of settlement of Bohai peoples. Two last capital cities were situated within the area of the Chinese people residence. The West Capital is the modern city of Ta-T'ung in Shansi province while the South one is the modern city of Peking (Steinhadrt 1997)." <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> "In 918, in another step toward establishing a more permanent regime, Apao-chi ordered the building of a great capital city, the Imperial Capital (Huang-tu), later to be known as the Supreme Capital (Shang-ching).

</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="General_Description">General Description</span></h4>
<p>"The Khitan first appear in documentary sources in the 4th century as a people of the south-central portion of northeast China, from a region of mountains and open grasslands. Under the leadership of Abaoji, the Khitan rapidly adopted a centralized royal form of organization, with clear similarities to Chinese traditions but also incorporating some of the familiar steppe pastoralist strategies (Wittfogel and Feng 1949, pp. 59-65). Although Buddhism was a central feature of the polity, as the empire expanded into Central Asia the majority of the population was actually Muslim (Biran 2006, p. 66; Dunnell 1996, p. 4)." <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>
</p><p>"Liao occupation of the Central Plains, 947"<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-9"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>
</p>
<dl><dd>"The Liao emperor did not conquer and govern the Central Plains directly. ... by dint of military success, he had become the legitimate emperor of the Central Plains. Familiar with T'ang protocols, and advised by formally educated ministers from both Liao and the Later Chin, Te-kuang observed such practices as declaring a new dynasty, wearing Chinese dress, and reemploying former officials. ... He appointed new governors, demoted K'ai-feng from its capital status, and established Chen-chou as a capital instead. But Te-kuang did not intend to stay. ... he treaded the conquest as a very large raid, in which public relations were irrelevant and only loot mattered. Perhaps most damaging to Te-kuang's image was the policy of "smashing the pasture and grain" (ta ts'ao-yu) ... The Liao armies devestated the region around the capital, foraging to supply themselves and practicing the all-too-common cruelties of soldiers in wartime. To reward his troops, claimed to number three hundred thousand, Te-kuang demanded from an already overtaxed population cash and cloth to be stockpiled for transport north. Most ambitious of all was Te-kuang's attempt to take north every material element of the Later Chin imperial institution, including palace women and eunuchs, the complete contents of the imperial storehouses, and every last bureaucrat. ... Te-kuang ... apparently wrote his younger brother listing his own three faults in this venture: demanding cash from the people. ordering indiscriminate foraging and plundering, and failing to return the governors to their provinces in good time. The letter, preserved in the Liao shih (Official history of the Liao), describes the "foreignness" of the Khitan: they are raiders (rather than tax collectors) and pastoralists (rather than farmers), and they keep their governors at court(rather than giving them active responsibility in their provinces)."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>Revolts against Liao: "Te-kuang, preoccupied with removing himself and his plunder north to the Liao homeland, was largely unresponsive to these events, although he did make an example of Hsiang-chou2, slaughting some hundred thousand men and children, and taking away the women." <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>"The Liao, for their part,did not vigorously defend the territory they had conquered. On the few occasions when they did fight, they did not try very hard."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-12"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>"The one region the Liao seemed concerned to hold was the key strategic city of Chen-chou, which controlled the main access between the Central Plains and the Liao homeland." <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-13"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup></dd></dl>

</p><p>"The comitatus of the early Khitan, a Mongolic people, is known from the ac- counts of An Lu-shan’s Rebellion. For a detailed treatment of the later Liao Dynasty of the Khitan, including discussion of its imperial guard corps, see the outstanding early study by Wittfogel and Fêng (1949). “Each [Khitan Liao] emperor had a separate ordo, or camp, with a ‘heart and belly guard’ of 10,000 to 20,000 households. . . . The members of this guard, particularly the non-Khitans, were the emperor’s private slaves, but their proximity to him gave them high status. After the emperor’s death they guarded his mausoleum while his suc- cessor recruited a new ordo and guard” (Atwood 2004: 297). The Liao state, with its five capitals (ordo), seems to have been organized, theoretically, around the ideal of the “khan and four-bey” system. The khan of the Kereit, who were rivals of Temüjin during his rise to power, “had crack forces of ba’aturs, ‘heroes’, and a 1,000-man day guard, institutions Chinggis Khan would later imitate” (Atwood 2004: 296), along with the golden tent (ordo) connected to them." <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-14"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>

<p>"The highest levels of the empire’s social pyramid were occupied by the imperial clan of Yeh-lü and clan of the empress Hsiao. The representatives of these clans were the first-rate proprietors in the country and held a major portion of the most important military and civil posts in the empire administration. Since the rule of the empire founder Apao-chi, the clan has been subdivided into two parts: Five or North Divisions and Six or South Divisions. These parts were governed by grand princes (wang).

T'ien-tso was demoted to the rank of a prince (it is for this reason that he was never granted a temple name). ' The Liao empire was now split: Tien-tso's authority, such as it was, was confined to the remote tribal areas of the far west. The territory controlled by Prince Ch'un was limited to the sedentary southern regions, and the Liao empire he ruled was reduced to a minor Chinese frontier state, its officials mostly Chinese, and the army, once almost entirely composed of Khitan tribesmen, now a motley mixture of Chinese troops and refugees from the east, under Khitan or Hsi commanders."  <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-100"><a href="#cite_note-100">[100]</a></sup></dd>

Above all, they resented his favorite Hsiao Feng-hsien's ability to prevent the emperor's hearing their own proposals or even from learning how truly desperate the situation was. In the spring of 1121 Lady Wen, the second wife of T'ien-tso and mother of the prince of Chin, conspired with her brother-in-law, General Yeh-lii Yii-tu, to depose the emperor and install her own son in his stead. The plot was uncovered by the emperor's favorite Hsiao Feng-hsien, who was the brother of a rival consort, Lady Yuan, and hoped to ensure the succession for one of her sons. Lady Wen was forced to commit suicide, and some of the other conspirators were executed.

<dl><dd><b>♠ elite status is hereditary ♣ present ♥</b> "Sons and grandsons of high Chinese officials of the Liao also enjoyed the hereditary privilege of entry to office (yin) as under the T'ang, and such entrants generally enjoyed better prospects than did graduates. This practice fitted with the Khitans' widespread traditional use of hereditary succession (shih-hsiian) to office. Many offices were reserved for members of specific lineages of the Yeh-lii and Hsiao clans. Khitans were debarred from taking the Chinese examinations. Shortly after Sheng-tsung's death a prominent scholarly member of the imperial clan, Yeh-lii Shu-chen, was given two hundred lashes for allowing his precocious son to sit illegally for the chin-shih examination. The son was, nevertheless, employed and later gained preferment because he was also able to prove his mastery of a true Khitan skill, archery,' by killing three hares with three successive arrows." <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-103"><a href="#cite_note-103">[103]</a></sup> "The southern commissioners were usually members of the Yeh-lii royal clan, the northern commissioners mostly members of the Hsiao consort clan. The administration of the Northern Region was mainly, though not exclusively, staffed by Khitan holding traditional Khitan titles. Its most powerful officers were the Khitan commissioners for military affairs, the prime ministers of the Northern and Southern administrations {Pei-fu tsai-hsiang, Nan-fu tsai-hsiang), the Northern and Southern Great Kings (Pei Ta-wang, Nan Ta- wang), both of whom were members of the royal clan, and the commander in chief {yu-yueh). These men controlled all military and tribal affairs, the selection of military commanders, the disposition of the tribal herds, and the allocation of pastures. Beneath them was a bewildering array of tribal officials, an office for the royal clan of the former Po-hai state, and a range of offices providing services to the imperial house: artisans, physicians, huntsmen, and commissioners responsible for the royal herds, stud farms, and stables. No one could possibly confuse the administration of the Northern Region with the orderly model of T'ang government. It was essentially a great tribal leader's personal retinue, and many of its offices were specifically reserved for members of one or another branch of the royal or consort clans and filled by hereditary selection (shih-hsiian)."  <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-104"><a href="#cite_note-104">[104]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Religion_and_Normative_Ideology">Religion and Normative Ideology</span></h2>
<p>We are interested here in any systems of thought and behavior that can influence people's actions, which we term a <i>Normative Ideology</i>.  Normative ideologies are thought-systems concerned with the correct behavior of people, governments/leaders, and other groups (and particularly the relationships between these groups).
</p><p>Mainly, this will be a religious or ritual system. As usual, when we mention Religious or Ritual System our focus  is on the 'official cult', defined the same way as in the Rituals section:
</p>
<dl><dd>With the official cult we refer to the set of collective religious practices that are most closely associated with legitimation of the power structure (including elites, if any).</dd></dl>
<p>However, Normative Ideologies are not restricted to religious/ritual systems. They include other thought systems, such as philosophy or anything that prescribes a particular pattern of behaviour. An example is  classical Greek philosophy, such as the works of Plato and Aristotle, who were concerned with correct or moral behaviour and whose thoughts influenced the actual practice of several societies (the empire of Alexander the Great, notably).
