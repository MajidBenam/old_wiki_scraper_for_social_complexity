<p><b> ♠ Duration  ♣ 802-1100 CE ♥ </b>
</p>
<dl><dd>• This period begins in 802 CE because an inscription (the Sdok Kak Thom) notes that a king (Jayavarman II) conducted a ceremony to free Cambodia from Java by declaring himself the universal monarch (chakravarti).</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>• This period ends in 1100 CE because that is approximately the year that a new dynasty (the Mahīdharapura, originally from the Khorat area) began under Jayavarman VI.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>• 'The Angkor period is commonly understood to start in 802 CE with the proclamation of Jayavarman II as the chakravartin (universal-king) from a location in the Kulen mountains (Phnom Kulen), overlooking the vast alluvial plain where Angkor would begin to emerge in the following centuries (Figure 1). In doing so, Jayavarman confirmed himself as the great unifier; drawing Cambodia’s disparate polities together under the first ‘god king’ and establishing the Khmer state and the basis of its empire. Phnom Kulen was known as Mahendraparvata; ‘‘the hill of the great Indra’’. The extant history of Mahendraparvata is based on several inscriptions, the most well-known being an 11th century CE inscription (K.235) found at the Sdok Kak Thom temple, in eastern Thailand [4]. The inscription, dated to 1052 CE, outlines the lineage of a private family serving successive Khmer Kings for two and a half centuries, the first mentioned being Jayavarman II.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>• 'Shadowy as he appears through retrospective inscriptions, Jayavarman II still occupies a central position in the history of Angkor, becauase he was regarded for centuries after his death as he who founded the state, in a traditional date of 802 AD.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>• The end of the Angkor in approximately 1432 CE with the Siamese 'invasion' or 'sacking' of Angkor. "Scholars usually place the Angkorean period of Cambodian history between 802 and 1431.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>• 'There was a watershed, dated to the year 802, whereby a series of competing polities were joined into one enduring and powerful central state. This transition involved a process of contralization instituted by the overlord Jayavarman II (ruled 802 to 834). Jayavarman seems to have identified a means of unifying formerly competing overlords that was rooted first in military conquest, then by placing his followers in positions of authority. This had the effect of establishing a central rule through replacing independent polities by provinces. He also must have appreciated the importance of stressing the mystical properties of kingship by instituting the cult of the kamraten jagat ta raja, meaning "the god who is king." Deification of the ruler, linked with vesting the rights to consecrate a new god-king in successive members of a given family, meant that the succession should be assured. Remarkably, the ensuing five centuries witnessed a considerable degree of legitimacy in the succession, being largely confined to members of the aristocratic lineage of Aninditapura.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>• 'Traditionally, the Angkorian period is said to have begun in 802, the year that Jayavarman II (r. 802-834) was crowned king. In a ritual evoking the mythology of  ̋iva and celebrated in the Phnom Kulen (Kulen Mountains), north of Angkor, he became the cakravartin/cakkavatti (universal monarch) of the new kingdom.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>• 'The elephant was most clearly recorded during the Khmer empire dating from roughly 809 C.E. to 1431 C.E. During this time, the great temple of Angkor Wat and the Bayon were built.The frequent wars against theThais and Chams involved use of large “tuskers,” or superior male elephants, as well as elephants that carried men and goods. Elephants were important in moving the stones that built the temples, the logs that built the palaces, and the rice and other foods produced by the popu- lace to feed the royalty and the priests.The war elephants are wonderfully illustrated in the reliefs on the gallery walls of Angkor Wat. Similarly, many elephants are found among the carvings on the walls of Borobudur, the great Javanese Hindu-Buddhist temple dating to about 800 C.E.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>• 'In the history of Cambodia, the year 802 symbolizes the beginning of the Angkor era because the Sdok Kak Thom inscription specifies that Jayavarman II conducted a ceremony to free Cambodia from Java in that year.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-9"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>• 'Cambodian history is normally divided into the pre-Angkor (third century to 802 CE), Angkor (802-1432), and post-Angkor periods. The pre-Angkor period is mainly known from seventh-century inscriptions; Angkor epigraphy begins in the late ninth century. Thus there is a crucial gap in our sources during the critical transitional phase.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>• 'The founder of Angkor, King Jayavarman II, is a shadowy figure and we still have no entirely satisfactory explanation as to why he moved his capital from the Mekong Valley to the drier region at the north-west tip of the Great Lake. He left no inscriptions that we know of. We know that he established his court in the region in 802 AD and that he reigned for almost 50 years before his death at Roluos, south-east of the main complex at Angkor.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ unitary state ♥ </b>
</p>
<dl><dd>• 'All the institutions of government reviewed above give the impression that they belong to an apparatus of (as least potentially) oppressive, even totalitarian, power. Indeed, it is altogether likely that after the time of Rajendravarman the kings of Angkor presided over a much more centralized regime than the Khmers had known before. Institutions of government embodied no principles of constitutional checks upon royal power beyond the notion of religious morality. An impulse to totalitarian government was present, and found expression whenever rulers found themselves temporarily without dangerous rivals still at large. We must remember, though, that this tate lacked all the advantages of modern communications and technology to assert its control in detail, and that all sorts of regional, personal and factional loyalties were liable to obstruct the impulse to totalitarianism before too long.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-12"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>• 'Angkor under Suyavarman [II] was at the peak of its glory. The institutional reforms of Rajendravarman were secure, giving a measure of centralisation to the administration of the empire.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-13"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> :• :• 'The central administration in Angkor must have had fairly detailed information for the purposes of taxation and core labour of all the empire's inhabitants, for according to Zhou a census was taken during the ninth Cambodian month, where everyone (or, more likely, all heads of families) was called to the capital, and passed in review before the Royal Palace. Such census registers were kept in Aymonier's day, and revised every three years.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-14"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> 'Because the Angkor kingdom commanded a significant army and a large centralized administrative apparatus and because thousands of workers were needed to build and maintain its enormous building complexes, it has been assumed that around the stone constructions of the palaces and temples a city with a substantial population must have existed.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-15"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>• 'Jayavarman II appears to have brought significant land and regional lords into a ‘single’ domain by 802 CE. We can begin to discern a ‘united’ polity, and a series of single or at least preeminent capitals: Hariharālaya (Roluos); Yaśodharapura (Angkor); Koh Ker.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-16"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>• 'All such leaders were tied to the overlord by webs of family, mar- riage, and patronage whose instability ensured constant fluctuations in the center’s territorial influence. Reliable royal control in the sense of resource exaction was therefore confined to the capital zone, which nor- mally included the empire’s most populous districts but which might not exceed a 60-mile radius. In Pagan, Angkor, and to a lesser extent perhaps early Champa and Dai Viet, temples and monasteries served simultaneously as agencies of agricultural reclamation, ritual validation, and intra-elite alliance. Because these wealthy, self-regulating religious institutions helped to stabilize labor and to concentrate resources, they tended to compress and, in some ways, to obviate royal administration. Nonetheless, the ruler remained indispensable as ritual intermediary between kingdom and cosmos, as military leader, and as coordinator of temple as well as secular patronage. Thus, while accepting that these were weak forms of the genus, we can still recognize charter-era entities as “states” according to Charles Tilly’s minimalist definition: “coercion- wielding organizations that are distinct from households and kinship groups and exercise clear priority in some respects over all other orga- nizations within substantial territories.”45'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p><b> ♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥ </b>
</p>
<dl><dd>• Although Sūryavarman I formed alliances with Champa and China against Annam as did other leaders, these alliances were not long-standing or enshrined by inter-marriage. While tribute was at times paid to China, this too was not consistent or indicative of a subordinate relationship.</dd>
<dd>• 'George Coedes connected the Khmer request for aid to the internal politics of the Angkorian empire. In doing so, he noted the statement of the PrdsdtBen inscription, that Jayaviravarman's"universal glory was not destroyed by the times. Although beaten, he remainedstableon the earth ..." 67). Elaborating on this statement, Coedes suggested that the gift of the "king of Kambaja"in the Puttur plates correspondedin time to a Khmer military campaign into the Chao Phrayariver valley and was SuiryavarmanI's request for aid against his rival Jayaviravarmanand Tambralinga. Faced with a possible [...] alliance,Tambralinga turned for aid to Srivijaya. In Coedes'view, the result of this complicated diplomacy was the raid,which, as expressed in the famous Tanjore inscription of o030 was directed at Srivijaya and its ports-one of which was Tambralinga (Midimalifigam)68). Completing his argument, Coedes stated that the Ch6la expedition led to the reintroduction of Khmer influence in the isthmian region during the second quarter of the century.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-18"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<dd><b> ♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥ </b> 'The establishment of a grand and long-lasting civilization centred on the northern shore of the Tonle Sap does not represent a major dislocation with the preceding Chenla statelets, nor indeed with the preceding prehistoric period, for Iron Age burials and occupation have been identified under the early Hindu temple of Prei Khmeng, just west of Angkor, and next to the southern entrance to the city of Angkor Thom. [...] All the characteristics of ANgkor were previsouly evolving in the Chenla polities, but they were magnified and given stability through the centralising manupulation of power excersised by a succession of rulers imbued with unusual charisma and prowess.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-19"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> 'It is clear that during the two centuries or so preceding AD 802 - the founding date of the Khmer Empire - there were a number of independent states in Khmer territory, not just the one, or at most two of the so-called 'Zhenla' of the Chinese annals.

In doing so, Jayavarman confirmed himself as the great unifier; drawing Cambodia’s disparate polities together under the first ‘god king’ and establishing the Khmer state and the basis of its empire.

Local dynasts of ancient principalities were increasingly absorbed into a central apparatus, more officials were dispatched to the provinces, and administrative divisions were to some extent standardized. The core population around Angkor expanded markedly, facilitating the construction of unprecedentedly grand hydraulic projects and religious buildings. Shortly before Pagan expanded from Upper Burma to conquer the coast, the Khmer empire itself expanded from the Mekong and around the Great Lake to in- corporate the Mun and Chi valleys to the north and the rich region around Lopburi to the west. A more shadowy authority extended over the upper peninsula.12 Ecclesiastical foundations spearheaded frontier colonization, particularly west and northwest of Angkor in what is now eastern and central Thailand, where Khmer culture and language exer- cised growing influence.13 As the economy grew more complex, it has been suggested that the number of urban sites in the empire more than doubled.14 By the reign of Suryavarman II (r. 1113-1145/1150), builder of Angkor Wat, the empire was arguably at its height, with varying de- grees of authority over the Chaophraya basin, Champa, and much of what is now northern and southern Thailand and Laos.&lt;/ref&gt;(Lieberman 2003, pp. 218-219)&lt;/ref&gt;

<p>'Because all the Classic inscriptions deal with matters that are fundamentally religious in nature [...] we have much information on the central religious hierarchy, but little about the secular one. [...] The religious authorities and functionaries in the royal court were certainly almost entirely Brahmin caste [Level 2], although some priests in the provinces and villages [Level 1] may not have been so. Most of them may have received the honorific Khmer title of sten an, reserved for learned men. We already run across the purohita [Level 4]. In peninsular India, this Sanskrit word indicated a family priest or chaplain; in Classic Angkor, this important individual was the chaplain and chief priest of the king and, at least according to the self-serving Sdok Kak Thom stela, was a hereditary officer charged with maintaining the cult of the devajara. The Sanskrit title of hotar or 'sacrificer' occurs frequently in the texts; this is also supposed to indicate 'royal chaplain' - but the exact scope of the term is unclear since while the royal purohita of the devaraja was a hotar, there were other hotars [Level 3]. Most of these may have had important administrative roles. There were many religious functionaries who received the Sanskrit title of acharya, a learned priest who acted as teacher and spiritual guide; or pandit, someone versed in sacred lore; or of upadhyaya, a teacher and preceptor learned in the vedas [Level 2].

According to David Chandler, 'Though the king, who led his country into battle, sometimes engaged his chief enemy in single combat, Khmer military strength rested on the junior officers, the captains of militia. These men commanded the loyalty of peasant groups in their particular locality. If the king conquered a region, a new captain of militia would be enrolled and put under an oath of allegiance. The captains were simply headmen of the outlying regions, but their connection with the king enhanced their status. In time of war they were expected to conscript the peasants in their district and to lead them to Angkor to join the Khmer army. If the captains disobeyed the king they were put to death. The vast majority of the Khmer population were of the farmer-builder-soldier class.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-68"><a href="#cite_note-68">[68]</a></sup> 'One major feature of the 'imperial state' was its maintenance of a large court and a corps of officials. Angkor has a sizeable bureaucracy staffed by officials of many sorts. Like so much about the Khmer kingdom in ancient times, the structure of government and the categories of the civil service are known to us through temple inscriptions, which frequently name various types of official or local dignitary in listing those present to witness the formal demarcation of land bestowed upon religious foundations; they mention a variety of grades and titles, some of them obscure. The khlon rajakarya was responsible for the administration of 'royal work', probably corvee among other things. The tamrvac was an inspector; the officials who swore allegiance to Suryavarman I had this title, for example. The gunadosadarsin (assessor of virtues and defects) was concerned with temple property. A variety of functionaries were called khlon (inspector) and had responsibilities in various areas such as grain, temple dues, management of religious foundations and several aspects of court proceedings. Revenue was usually in kind, being paid in grain, but some special districts paid in other commodities such as honey and wax. There is evidence that some of the categories in which officials were placed were not types of professional specialisation but divisions of the government service placed under the patronage of particular chiefs belonging to the royal family, a system that was indeed known in later centuries. Some of the groups of dignitaries named in named in the inscriptions, again, appear to have been the bearers of hereditary privileges in the royal household; the term varna, for example, designates any of a number of orders of dignity, which have such official functions as religious teachers, performers of rites, door guardians, garden keepers, palace servants, bearers of flywhisks, and artists.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-69"><a href="#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup> 'At Angkor Wat at the head of the "historic" march past, appears a foreign contingent identified by an epigraphic inscription as the chief of the Siamese and his troops.

<p><b> ♠ Full-time bureaucrats ♣ present ♥ </b> 'One major feature of the 'imperial state' was its maintenance of a large court and a corps of officials. Angkor has a sizeable bureaucracy staffed by officials of many sorts. Like so much about the Khmer kingdom in ancient times, the structure of government and the categories of the civil service are known to us through temple inscriptions, which frequently name various types of official or local dignitary in listing those present to witness the formal demarcation of land bestowed upon religious foundations; they mention a variety of grades and titles, some of them obscure. The khlon rajakarya was responsible for the administration of 'royal work', probably corvee among other things. The tamrvac was an inspector; the officials who swore allegiance to Suryavarman I had this title, for example. The gunadosadarsin (assessor of virtues and defects) was concerned with temple property. A variety of functionaries were called khlon (inspector) and had responsibilities in various areas such as grain, temple dues, management of religious foundations and several aspects of court proceedings. Revenue was usually in kind, being paid in grain, but some special districts paid in other commodities such as honey and wax. There is evidence that some of the categories in which officials were placed were not types of professional specialisation but divisions of the government service placed under the patronage of particular chiefs belonging to the royal family, a system that was indeed known in later centuries. Some of the groups of dignitaries in named in the inscriptions, again, appear to have been the bearers of hereditary privileges in the royal household; the term varna, for example, designates any of a number of orders of dignity, which have such official functions as religious teachers, performers of rites, door guardians, garden keepers, palace servants, bearers of flywhisks, and artists.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-82"><a href="#cite_note-82">[82]</a></sup>

These are sometimes able to provide alternative views of the society in which they were produced and can be compared with the temple inscription texts. In Burma, for example, the availability of a variety of historical text types (government archives, law codes, histories and administrative records, civil codes and chronicles giving narrative accounts) represent contemporary Burmese society somewhat more comprehensively (Aung Thwin 1983: 48; 1985: 8-12).'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-92"><a href="#cite_note-92">[92]</a></sup>

However, the content of the Khmer inscriptions differ markedly from the Sanskrit ones. They are not addressed to gods, but to a temporal audience: authorities and officials, relatives of the founders, and in their broad imprecations, to the world in general. The authors tend not to express a political agenda here, in that they do not praise or assert power. The Khmer inscriptions seem more like legal documents - they often record the history of endowments made to foundations and they establish the ownership of land, setting out the rights of the foundation and the founder’s family. Vickery (1985) has suggested that many such texts in the 10th and 11th centuries have a certain political agenda on the part of the authors, who often appear to be concerned with their claims to titles and land. The texts may list and describe in detail the property of the foundation, record the donors, the circumstances under which land was acquired, the price paid, and settlement of disputes by courts. They may note the weight, quantity and material of temple ‘treasure’ or objects used in exchanges, the rice production of foundation lands, sometimes their location and dimensions. Requirements for continuing support for divinities and temple personnel may be set out and personnel might be listed, sometimes by name, gender, dependents, duties or place of origin, or else as totals. The texts may also refer to imposts or immunities granted to the foundations. The king is frequently acknowledged in inscriptions authored by individuals other than rulers, and a date is often recorded. The king is depicted as having a key role in state administration, establishing inquiries and being at least nominally responsible for legal decisions, ordering building works to be initiated, etc. There is an emphasis on the role of the ruler or of his predecessors in giving land, granting permission to purchase it or materially supporting the foundation, presumably placing the founder and his relatives under some future obligations. The authors record the merit, accrued by the ruler through his generosity, which is mostly dealt with poetically in the Sanskrit texts. Inscriptions written by rulers in Old Khmer are edicts relating mostly to matters of law, temple administration or land allocation and taxation. The texts are somewhat formulaic, though of varying length. Presumably, wealthier temples had more resources warranting recording, and had more literate scribes to produce the texts.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-96"><a href="#cite_note-96">[96]</a></sup>

From the new map an outline can be provide of the development of the network between the 8th-9th and the 14th centuries. Each large extension of the network tapped water from a succession of natural rivers flowing from NE to SW. Each river was further north and was tapped further to the west. The network had five major components - E-W embankments that trapped water flowing from the north and northeast; N-S channels that eventually delivered water to large reservoirs (baray); the baray and the large temple moats; embankments and channels oriented from NW to SE that could distribute water back from west to east across the slope of the land; and channels oriented towards the southwest which could dispose of water rapidly to the lake, the Tonle Sap. Significantly the later major channels, such as the Angkor Wat canal and the canal that pre-dated the current Siem Reap river, were drains that served to dispose of water into the lake.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-104"><a href="#cite_note-104">[104]</a></sup> '[T]he Khmer practised water management on a scale dwarfing that of the Maya and most other regions of the world.

The drastic water level changes prevents the construction of fixed structures, therefore the ports may have been composed of stilted buildings, floating platforms and elevated trackways from the platforms to the shore or from boats to the shore. <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-127"><a href="#cite_note-127">[127]</a></sup>. Perhaps the largest ports were built by the state, but smaller transit points for riverine trade would have probably been organized by local communities, as they wouldn't require great investments. <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-128"><a href="#cite_note-128">[128]</a></sup>. Other researchers have suggested that there were no ports: '[...] Cambodia had no deep-water port of its own until the 1950s'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-129"><a href="#cite_note-129">[129]</a></sup> 'Given the location of Angkor in relation to Chinese or Cham ports, some or much of the reported trade was probably overland rather than via coastal ports.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-130"><a href="#cite_note-130">[130]</a></sup> It could be argued that the type of boats used in Cambodia do not require deep ports, but larger boats are documented in the bas-reliefs of Angkor <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-131"><a href="#cite_note-131">[131]</a></sup>. Even though there may not have ventured into the Tonle Sap lake, the large planked vessel represented in the Bayon indicates that large vessels arrived in Angkorian ports. Similarly, ethnographic data shows an extensive use of boats for transport, so even if the coastal trade may have been limited, as Lusting suggests, trade using inland waters must have been necessarily conducted. <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-132"><a href="#cite_note-132">[132]</a></sup>.</dd></dl>

Yet, although Indian Brahmins were occasionally brought in (Wolters 1982: 91), Sanskrit culture was generally indigenised, with local inflections present from the beginning. Khmer Brahmins are said to be the authors of major Sanskrit works such as the Ta Prohm and Prah Khan inscriptions (Pollock 1996: 220; 222). In Jacques’ (1986: 328) view, the elite that knew Sanskrit was very small and since the texts are found only on temple sites, this may suggest that the only audience for the Sanskrit inscriptions was the gods. Whereas the use of Sanskrit in public writing died out quickly in Burma and Java, it lasted up to the late 13th century in Cambodia (Footnote 47).

However, the content of the Khmer inscriptions differ markedly from the Sanskrit ones. They are not addressed to gods, but to a temporal audience: authorities and officials, relatives of the founders, and in their broad imprecations, to the world in general. The authors tend not to express a political agenda here, in that they do not praise or assert power. The Khmer inscriptions seem more like legal documents - they often record the history of endowments made to foundations and they establish the ownership of land, setting out the rights of the foundation and the founder’s family. Vickery (1985) has suggested that many such texts in the 10th and 11th centuries have a certain political agenda on the part of the authors, who often appear to be concerned with their claims to titles and land. The texts may list and describe in detail the property of the foundation, record the donors, the circumstances under which land was acquired, the price paid, and settlement of disputes by courts. They may note the weight, quantity and material of temple ‘treasure’ or objects used in exchanges, the rice production of foundation lands, sometimes their location and dimensions. Requirements for continuing support for divinities and temple personnel may be set out and personnel might be listed, sometimes by name, gender, dependents, duties or place of origin, or else as totals. The texts may also refer to imposts or immunities granted to the foundations. The king is frequently acknowledged in inscriptions authored by individuals other than rulers, and a date is often recorded. The king is depicted as having a key role in state administration, establishing inquiries and being at least nominally responsible for legal decisions, ordering building works to be initiated, etc. There is an emphasis on the role of the ruler or of his predecessors in giving land, granting permission to purchase it or materially supporting the foundation, presumably placing the founder and his relatives under some future obligations. The authors record the merit, accrued by the ruler through his generosity, which is mostly dealt with poetically in the Sanskrit texts. Inscriptions written by rulers in Old Khmer are edicts relating mostly to matters of law, temple administration or land allocation and taxation. The texts are somewhat formulaic, though of varying length. Presumably, wealthier temples had more resources warranting recording, and had more literate scribes to produce the texts.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-148"><a href="#cite_note-148">[148]</a></sup></dd>

During his later years at least he does not seem to have had all Chenla under his control; for, in a reign of perhaps more than 40 years, with more inscriptions than any other king before Yasovarman I, the inscriptions of his reign seem but once or twice to get away from the immediate region of the Mekong and its route to its port.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-186"><a href="#cite_note-186">[186]</a></sup> According to Coe (2003), iron was used in weaponry, including knives, spears and arrowheads since Iron Age chiefdoms (c. 500 BC to c. 200-500 CE).

The bas-reliefs of Agkor Wat depict the conquests of Suryavarman II (1113-c. 1150 CE), while those at the Bayon and Banteay Chhmar depict the conquests of Jayavarman VII (1181-c. 1218 CE). Thus, the detailed bas-reliefs of these three temples allows the scholar to examine Khmer military history spanning roughly one hundred years. Unfortunately, Jacq-Hergoualc'h does not make explicit (or quantify) the evolutionary changes over this time period. The earlier military technology at Angkor Wat depicts 'the most basic weapons, essentially lances, bows and arrows, and bucklers, sometimes in tandem with breastplates' (Jacq-Hergoualc'h 2007: 173). As noted by Coe (2003: 186), '[f]ar more sophisticated armament is to be seen on the Bayon and at Banteay Chhmar, especially among the infantry. This includes the ballista, mounted either on elephant back or on a wheeled vehicle that could be rolled onto the field of battle [...].' According to Jacq-Hergoualc'h (2007: 35), none of these 'big machines' are present on the bas-reliefs of Angkor Wat, the construction of which (c. 1113-1145 CE) pre-dates the great battles with the Chams during the reign of Jayavarman VII (beginning in c. 1181 CE). Furthermore, the emphasis on horses diminished and chariots were abandoned in favor of a more developed and elaborate corps of elephants surrounded by infantry.</dd>

Jayavarman seems to have identified a means of unifying formerly competing overlords that was rooted first in military conquest, then by placing his followers in positions of authority. This had the effect of establishing a central rule through replacing independent polities by provinces. He also must have appreciated the importance of stressing the mystical properties of kingship by instituting the cult of the kamraten jagat ta raja, meaning "the god who is king." Deification of the ruler, linked with vesting the rights to consecrate a new god-king in successive members of a given family, meant that the succession should be assured. Remarkably, the ensuing five centuries witnessed a considerable degree of legitimacy in the succession, being largely confined to members of the aristocratic lineage of Aninditapura.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-275"><a href="#cite_note-275">[275]</a></sup> 'Traditionally, the Angkorian period is said to have begun in 802, the year that Jayavarman II (r. 802-834) was crowned king. In a ritual evoking the mythology of  ̋iva and celebrated in the Phnom Kulen (Kulen Mountains), north of Angkor, he became the cakravartin/cakkavatti (universal monarch) of the new kingdom.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-276"><a href="#cite_note-276">[276]</a></sup> 'In the history of Cambodia, the year 802 symbolizes the beginning of the Angkor era because the Sdok Kak Thom inscription specifies that Jayavarman II conducted a ceremony to free Cambodia from Java in that year.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-277"><a href="#cite_note-277">[277]</a></sup> 'In the Angkor Cambodia realm, a symbolic <i>Mount Mahendra/Meru</i> temple mountain became the ritual home of the devaraja in the cult of Jayavarman II in the early ninth century—a cult that inclusively incorporated and subordinated worship of local deities to the king's worship of Siva (see chapter 6). As the traditional abode of ancestor spirits, mountains were already considered sacred by indigenous tradition. By patronizing the external god Siva, who was known in Indian philosophy as the Lord of the Mountains and for his association with fertility, the kings reinforced their local stature. It remained for Cambodian kings to link themselves ritually with this mountain, the domicile of the ancestors and Siva, and thereby make a profound statement about their ability to guarantee the flow of life-power from the realm of the ancestors—and Siva—to their subjects.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-278"><a href="#cite_note-278">[278]</a></sup> 'For six centuries, Angkor was the centre of an illustrious state ruled by god-kings (Jacques and Freeman 1998).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-279"><a href="#cite_note-279">[279]</a></sup> 'In 881 [AD], King Indravarman had an inscription carved which read 'In 881 AD, the king, like a god, dispenser of riches, has erected a linga named Indresvara here.' This name links that of the king with the supreme Hindu god Siva.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-280"><a href="#cite_note-280">[280]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Rulers are gods ♣ present ♥</b> 'While "god-king" was a mistranslation of kamrateng jagat ta raja, it may not have been far off the mark as a description of how people felt about the king of Cambodia. An eleventh-century inscription describes the king as possessing a "subtle inner self " that actually resided in a lingam found in the king's royal pyramid-temple. This "subtle inner self " implies that whatever essence is shared by the king and the lingam derives from Uiva. As a verification, inscriptions also refer to the king as having within himself a portion (amsa) of Uiva. An inscription praising King Udayadityavarman (r. 1050- 1066), the same king of the "subtle inner self," states that "the most minor details of the ritual of Uiva prescribed in the texts . . . were known in their totality. . . by this king who was a portion of Uiva (Uivamsa)." If these statements do not exactly make the king Uiva incarnate, he at least embodied some indefinable segment of the divine Uiva." <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-281"><a href="#cite_note-281">[281]</a></sup>

</p><p>'Snellgrove concludes the chapter with an interesting assessment on the religious beliefs of Jayavarman VII. He installed Mahayana Buddhism, rather than Hinduism, as the state religion at the beginning of his reign and expressed its ideals in his architectural sites. The court rituals, however, remained Brahmanical. Jayavarman VII is noted for building 102 hospitals throughout the kingdom and 121 rest houses along the royal roads extending from the capital of Angkor to the provincial centres. The chapels at these sites were dedicated to the Buddha Master of Medicine (Bhaisajyaguru), who is considered part of the Mahayana Buddhist pantheon, yet in this period he is depicted in the posture and hand position of a typical image of the seated Buddha, Shakyamuni, of the Theravada school. His right palm is turned outwards in the gesture of generosity, and he holds a begging bowl and a myrobalan fruit, a typical medicinal plant. Snellgrove, therefore, believes
Jayavarman VII may have had the vision that Theravada, not Mahayana, Buddhism was the form that held promise for the future. And indeed it is the one practiced in Cambodia today."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-290"><a href="#cite_note-290">[1]</a></sup>
</p><p>'This period of the 13th and 14th centuries might well be referred to as 'The Decline of Khmer Empire'. but it was primarily a decline at the centre of Khmer power which led to the conversion of Cambodia to Buddhism. There is no doubt that from the 9th to the 12th centuries the royal cult of the Devaraja gave coherence and continuity to Khmer imperial policy. Mahayana Buddhism continued to hold its own, but it could not long survive the pressure of Theradava Buddhism, once the implicit protection of Khmer rulers was lost, namely when rulers themselves from Jayavarman VI onwards seem to have lost interest in the Devaraja concept. It is significant that he and his successors, mainly of the Mahidharapura dynasty, do not seem to have appointed a special Devaraja purohita. When Jayavarman VII instituted his form of Mahayana Buddhism in Brahmanical guide, both Brahmanical religion and Mahayana Buddhism were bound to lose against the pressures of Theravada Buddhism, which seems to have already permeated his realm. Moreover, due to the intolerable exactions that he demanded of his subjects, he seems to have effectively broken their will to submit to such tyranny thereafter.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-291"><a href="#cite_note-291">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>'Early Khmer leaders learned to justify their authority by placing it in a universal context of devotion that could fully absorb the religious aspirations and compel the loyalty of their followers. In a process of developing the theory and practice of an increasingly centralized political space, warfare among rival hegemons was rationalized as corresponding to deified moral conflict on a universal scale. Pre-Angkorean and post-Angkorean Khmer centres were located to the east and south, along the Mekong with direct access to the sea and the commerce-generated wealth that this access afforded; but Angkor depended upon rice.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-292"><a href="#cite_note-292">[3]</a></sup>
</p><p>'Once Khmer settlement had exploited the rice-growing potential of this region to a minimally- necessary level, and once Khmer leaders found ways of organizing their authority over much of this region, Angkor was the favoured site as long as agriculture remained the primary source of wealth.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-293"><a href="#cite_note-293">[4]</a></sup>
</p><p>'The conquests of Bhavavarman, Mahendravarman, and Jayavarman I reveal an unprecedented interest in northwestern Cambodia, the future site of Angkor, and this suggests that conquerors were beginning to understand the significance of rice, in contrast to international commerce, and to value a site that would allow them to control areas where rice could be or already was being grown. Jayavarman II began his career in the southeast of modern Cambodia, but his conquests were not completed until he had established himself near the future site of Angkor. This locality would remain the seat of Khmer kings for the next six centuries. On a nearby mountain, Sanskrit-educated priests performed a ceremony in the year 802 that nullified all prior oaths of vassalage and proclaimed Jayavarman II a universal monarch.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-294"><a href="#cite_note-294">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p>'Evidence permits only a few observations about the economic, social, and political organization of the Angkorean polity. It is certain that the economy was based upon wet-rice agriculture, that temples were promi- nent custodians of land and peasants, and that royal authority was expressed through a relatively well-developed hierarchy that included priests and religious sanctions.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-295"><a href="#cite_note-295">[6]</a></sup>
</p><p>'Angkorean history in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries reveals a pattern of strong kings followed by disorder. Suryavarman I, Suryavarman II, and Jayavarman VII all enjoyed relatively long and distinguished reigns. All three were apparently men of unusual ability. But they were unable to translate their personal achievements into any sort of long-term institutional stability, as, for example, Ly Phat Ma had been able to do at Thang-long during the 1030s and 1040s. The reasons for this are probably related to the relative lack of threat perceived by the Khmers and the accompanying lack of incentive to affirm orthodox patterns, whether in terms of religious thought or of royal succession. The Chams did not pose the same order of threat to the Khmers as Chinese dynasties did to the Vietnamese. When the formation of Thai polities in the Chao Phraya and Mekong basins posed a higher level of threat to Angkor in the thirteenth century, the Khmers adapted with fundamental economic and cultural changes; they did not respond as if they had irrevocably invested themselves in any particular political or cultural heritage.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-296"><a href="#cite_note-296">[7]</a></sup>
</p><p>'Following the Mahayana Buddhist fervour of Jayavarman VII, there was a brief revival of royal Saivism, but by the end of the thirteenth century Theravada Buddhism had spread widely among the Khmers, opening a new post-Angkorean age in Khmer culture. The building of monuments came to an end. Sanskrit inscriptions were replaced by Pali scriptures; the old brahmanical priestly class was replaced by peripatetic monks with begging bowls.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-297"><a href="#cite_note-297">[8]</a></sup>
