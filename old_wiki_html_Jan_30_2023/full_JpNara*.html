</p><p><b> ♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ vassalage ♥ '</b> In 600, when a Japanese army was confronting Sillan forces in territory at the southern tip of the Korean peninsula claimed by the Japanese court, a Chinese chronicle records the arrival of an embassy from Japan at the Sui court, which was allied with Silla against their common enemy Koguryo. From that time on for more than two centuries the Japanese government, spurred by military and cultural concerns, maintained official relations with the Chinese court, becoming in form a tributary state in the Chinese system of international relations. But by the end of the eighth century much had changed, internally as well as externally. The compilation of the Taiho and Yoro codes at the beginning of the century had put a capstone on the sinitically inspired structure of the statutory regime and rendered less pressing the need for study and observation of the operations of the Chinese government. Several generations of officials had provided a base of experience and learning, and it was no longer as necessary for student-officials to undertake the long journey to the Chinese capital at Ch'ang-an in search of the knowledge, books, and techniques required by the court's governmental machinery. National amour propre and pragmatic diplomatic aims had been served by Chinese recognition of Japan's high status in the Chinese tributary system. If Japan could still benefit greatly from intercourse with China, that was less in the realm of government, where official relations might be most useful, than in economic, cultural, and intellectual matters, which were perhaps more amenable to private routes of exchange. Externally, whatever justification there may have been for Japanese fears of the T'ang armies in Korea after the Japanese defeat in 663, such concerns were presumably much ameliorated in the following decade when the  Chinese forces in Korea withdrew north of the Taedong River (at P'yongyang), leaving a unified peninsula under the rule of Silla. <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> 'Japanese geography placed the country in the enviable position of being able to regulate its relations with the adjacent continent largely according to its own internally generated needs and desires. Although the court sometimes convinced itself that invasion by continental forces was imminent, Japanese defenses before the thirteenth century were never tested by anything more formidable than marauding pirates, and, even more important, the country never faced an enemy invasion. The court thus was generally able to determine the pace and depth of its official relations with the outside world unrestricted by the fierce pressures that characterized relations between states on the continent.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>

Nara proved not to be the hoped-for permanent site. Nevertheless, it represents the high point of the Japanese effort to learn from China. Physically, China’s influence was seen not only in the design of the city but also in grand buildings such as the Todaiji Temple - the largest wooden building in the world - and the huge bronze statue of Buddha it contained. <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>

<p><b> ♠ Polity territory ♣ ♥ </b> 'This does not mean, however, that ‘Japan’ has always existed as a country or that early inhabitants of the islands thought of themselves as ‘Japanese’. Some authors place the origins of the Japanese state in the third century CE, with the emergence of a ‘tumulus culture’ centered in the Yamato area of west-central Honshu. Others look to the fifth century, when the Yamato polity began to display bureaucratic tendencies, or to the seventh, when it established centralized rule over most of Honshu, Kyushu, and Shikoku. However, the northern and southern extremes of the archipelago remained outside central control throughout much of the pre-modern period. Despite the early establishment of an identifiable state structure, later Japanese history is replete with examples of political fragmentation and multiple sovereignty...The name ‘Japan’ (Nippon) came into use around 700 CE, and it is possible that e´lites throughout the archipelago began to think of themselves as ‘Japanese’ at this time.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-20"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> 'The government in Nara, once it was established, used its army to gain control over more of Japan proper. In the extreme south of Kyushu partially assimilated communities (variously known as the Kumaso or Hayahito) were brought under control. In the north of Honshu, however, the Ainu people held out more strongly. Renowned as fierce fighting men, in 776 they stormed the main government fort at Taga, massacred the garrison, and invaded the settled regions to the south from which they had been expelled.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-21"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> 'Although the authority of the centralized state was accepted in far-flung parts of Japan, it was in the capital itself that its power could be seen to the best advantage. The attempt to build a city with the proportions of a Chinese capital was an ambitious one in the year 710. In fact Nara never seems to have been as large as its designers planned. For all that it fell short of its Chinese model, the building of the new capital must have helped to promote the unity of the country.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-22"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> at the beginning of the Nara period some areas of southern Kyushu still lay outside the district system. These were incorporated rather quickly, again as the result of military campaigns. For a time, the frontier zone actually extended beyond Kyushu to the islands in the south. One of these, Tane, was administered as a separate province during the eighth and early ninth centuries. However, during the Heian period the state seems to have lost all control over the southern islands—the southern terminus of Kyushu effectively marked the end to state territory.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-23"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>

<dl><dd>'The government was run by a system of offices ranging from those closest to the emperor to others at more distant places and at lower levels. These offices had histories of their own, coming into existence at different times with different names and functions. Here we shall survey merely the ones that were probably named and defined in the Taiho administrative code of 701 and the Yoro code of 718.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-27"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>'Down through the administrative structure - from the heads of offices around the emperor to those in charge of local offices in distant regions - ran a hierarchy of office titles and ranks. Heads of the highest offices held the title of director (kami) who had assistants (suke), secretaries (jo), and clerks (sakan). (These four office titles were written with different characters but pronounced in the same way when held by officials serving in different ministries and agencies.) According to the Yoro adminstrative code of 718, the number of officials in the two councils and eight ministries totaled 331. If lower-ranking officials are added, the total was 6,487. Ranks provided a more precise indication of status than titles did, for officeholders with the same title had different ranks yielding different stipends and perquisites. The Taiho code set aside four imperial ranks (hon) for princes and near relatives of the emperor and thirty court ranks (kurai) for persons lower in the aristocratic order. The son or grandson of a nobleman holding the highest imperial rank was automatically awarded a junior fifth rank lower grade court rank when he reached the age of twenty-one. Special treatment for anyone with a fifth rank or above - apart from the rights that their sons had to a high rank when they turned twenty-one, irrespective of ability - is revealed by the generous stipends and retainers they received'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-28"><a href="#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup> 'The structure of the imperial court was a complex affair.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Religion_and_Normative_Ideology">Religion and Normative Ideology</span></h2>
<p>We are interested here in any systems of thought and behavior that can influence people's actions, which we term a <i>Normative Ideology</i>.  Normative ideologies are thought-systems concerned with the correct behavior of people, governments/leaders, and other groups (and particularly the relationships between these groups).
</p><p>Mainly, this will be a religious or ritual system. As usual, when we mention Religious or Ritual System our focus  is on the 'official cult', defined the same way as in the Rituals section:
</p>
<dl><dd>With the official cult we refer to the set of collective religious practices that are most closely associated with legitimation of the power structure (including elites, if any).</dd></dl>
<p>However, Normative Ideologies are not restricted to religious/ritual systems. They include other thought systems, such as philosophy or anything that prescribes a particular pattern of behaviour. An example is  classical Greek philosophy, such as the works of Plato and Aristotle, who were concerned with correct or moral behaviour and whose thoughts influenced the actual practice of several societies (the empire of Alexander the Great, notably).

<p><b>♠ Ideology reinforces prosociality ♣ present ♥</b> In the syncretic Shinto-Buddhist ideology that prevailed for many centuries in Japan, moral values mostly came from Buddhism: “Shinto was retained in the Japanese belief structure, even though it never developed the metaphysical worldview or system of ethics that characterize world religions. Perhaps this was because of its close connection with Japanese Buddhism, which had enough metaphysics and ethics to serve both.” <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-148"><a href="#cite_note-148">[148]</a></sup>  According to Buddhism: “The twofold benefit of living a morally good life is linked to a twofold motivation: ‘Protecting oneself, one protects others; protecting others, one protects oneself ’ - just as each acrobat in a balancing act protects his partner by concentrating on himself, and protects himself by concentrating on his partner (see SN 47:19). If we take care of our own spiritual development, we render a service to others; and if we develop love towards others, we thereby also help ourselves. Accordingly, it is explicitly stated, someone who pursues the path of salvation only for his or her own benefit is to be censured, while the one who follows the path for one’s own benefit and for the benefit of others is to be commended (see AN 7:64).” <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-149"><a href="#cite_note-149">[149]</a></sup> “Three segments of the Noble Eightfold Path (3 - 5) are traditionally subsumed under the principle of morality (śīla): ‘right speech’ (3), ‘right action’ (4) and ‘right livelihood’ (5). [...] ‘Right action’ is explained as abstaining from harming and killing sentient beings - including animals (!), and further as abstaining from ‘taking what is not given’ and from sexual misconduct, which means avoiding sexual relations with women who are still under the protection of their families, or with those who are married, betrothed, or celibate for religious reasons. From monks and nuns complete sexual abstention is demanded. ‘Right livelihood’ means abstaining from those sources of income which involve harming other beings: trading in weapons for instance, or trading in living beings, meat, intoxicants or poison; also included is the avoidance of fraud and avarice.” <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-150"><a href="#cite_note-150">[150]</a></sup>
