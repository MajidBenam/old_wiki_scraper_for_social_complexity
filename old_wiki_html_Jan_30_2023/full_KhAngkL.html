<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="General_Description">General Description</span></h4>
<dl><dd>The Khmer Empire was established in 802 CE, when a ruler known as Jayavarman II had himself proclaimed a 'universal monarch' in a ceremony performed by Sanskrit-speaking priests on a mountain close to the Tonlé Sap lake.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> By bringing previously independent polities under their control, Jayavarman II and his successors expanded their realm across mainland Southeast Asia, including parts of modern-day Cambodia, Thailand, Laos and Vietnam.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-9"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> Our Late Angkor period begins with the death of King Jayavarman VII around 1200 CE.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> In contrast to the burgeoning growth of the Khmer Empire during the Classic period, the Late Angkor period was characterized by political and economic decline, culminating in the sack of the city of Angkor by the Thai Kingdom of Ayutthaya in 1431.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The reign of Jayavarman VII marked the high point of Angkorean monument-building, and subsequent rulers did not carry out major construction projects at the ancient capital.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-12"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> Chinese diplomat Zhou Daguan visited Angkor in the late 13th century and saw temples capped in gold and copper, sumptuous religious festivals, thousands of slaves and servants, and a lively trade in Chinese goods.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-13"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-14"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> However, this grandeur concealed the fundamental instability of the state, and the Khmer administrative system with its centre at Angkor eventually disintegrated in the mid-15th century CE.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-15"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> Warfare became 'endemic',<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-16"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> and after the Ayyuthaya attacks in 1431, the rulers of Angkor moved to south-eastern Cambodia and founded a new capital at Phnom Penh.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-18"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p><i>Population and political organization</i>
</p>
<dl><dd>Numerous small kingdoms formed in the lower Mekong Basin in the mid-1st millennium CE, but until the conquests of Jayavarman II, most failed to outlive their founders.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-19"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> Jayavarman II managed to unify previously warring local lords under his aegis, turning independent polities into provinces and laying the foundations for over six centuries of Khmer rule centred on the Siem Reap plain.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-20"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Like many polities in Southeast Asia at the turn of the 1st millennium CE, the new kingdom, with its growing urban centre on the north shore of the Tonlé Sap, borrowed from Indian religious practices, concepts of divine kingship, language, writing and iconography in order to legitimize royal power.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-21"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-22"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> Its kings patronized both Hindu and Buddhist institutions, building monasteries and sanctuaries dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu and the Buddha that doubled as outposts of royal power throughout the realm.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-23"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-24"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>However, the Late Angkor period saw a decline in the importance of the Hindu <i>devaraja</i> (god-king) cult, while Theravada Buddhism gained an increasingly stronger foothold among both the people and their rulers.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-25"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-26"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> This is reflected in the scarcity of Sanskrit inscriptions referencing Hindu gods ‒ the last known Angkor inscription to use this language dates to 1327<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-27"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> ‒ and the increasing importance of Pali scriptures.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-28"><a href="#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup> While some scholars suggest that this religious shift contributed to the loosening of centralized Khmer power,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-29"><a href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup> the causes for imperial decline during this period remain a topic of intense scholarly debate.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-30"><a href="#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The riches of Angkor at the height of its power had always flowed from wet-rice agriculture,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-31"><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> and an institutionalized hierarchy of officials developed to funnel surplus rice produced in villages, as well as other goods like honey, spices, cloth and gold, to the royal centre.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-32"><a href="#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-33"><a href="#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup> Angkor kings also used corvée labour to build temples, irrigation infrastructure and other public works.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-34"><a href="#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-35"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> In this period, however, rice agriculture decreased in importance in favour of trade and commerce, potentially undermining the traditional power base of the Angkor kings.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-36"><a href="#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The Khmer Empire is famous for its sprawling but low-density urban sites.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-37"><a href="#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup> It has been claimed that Angkor itself was the 'largest settlement complex of the preindustrial world':<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-38"><a href="#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup> at its peak in the 12th century (before this period) it covered 1000 square kilometres and may have housed over 750,000 people.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-39"><a href="#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup> However, the total population of the empire in this period is still unclear.</dd></dl>

In the dry season, a hectare would require 15,000 cubic meters (525,000 cu. ft.) of water. Assuming all the major barays at Angkor were full to a depth of three meters (9.9 ft.), they could have supplied 7,000 hectares (17,500 acres). If they yielded 1.46 tons of rice per hectare and annual consumption was 220 kilograms (484 lbs.) of rice per capita, the dry season yield would have maintained about 44,500 people, about 2.5 percent of the estimated population. This calculation is based only on the amount of water available when the barays were three meters deep. It does not take into account the possibility that the barays were constantly replenished with water from the Siem Reap River throughout the dry season. There is also the possibility that the reservoirs were used to supplement water supplies to the fields when there was insufficient rainfall during the wet sea- son. If so, then a further 9,000 metric tons (9,900 tons) over and above anticipated wet-season production could have been obtained, making the total irrigated yield 19,200 tons, sufficient to feed nearly 100,000 people.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-50"><a href="#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup> 'At its peak, the population of the impe- rial core may have exceeded 1.5 million.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-51"><a href="#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup> 'At its height, Angkor was the largest premodern settlement in the world, a city of more than 700,000 spread over a larger area than modern Los Angeles.

Most of them may have received the honorific Khmer title of sten an, reserved for learned men. We already run across the purohita [Level 4]. In peninsular India, this Sanskrit word indicated a family priest or chaplain; in Classic Angkor, this important individual was the chaplain and chief priest of the king and, at least according to the self-serving Sdok Kak Thom stela, was a hereditary officer charged with maintaining the cult of the devajara. The Sanskrit title of hotar or 'sacrificer' occurs frequently in the texts; this is also supposed to indicate 'royal chaplain' - but the exact scope of the term is unclear since while the royal purohita of the devaraja was a hotar, there were other hotars [Level 3]. Most of these may have had important administrative roles. There were many religious functionaries who received the Sanskrit title of acharya, a learned priest who acted as teacher and spiritual guide; or pandit, someone versed in sacred lore; or of upadhyaya, a teacher and preceptor learned in the vedas [Level 2].

The captains were simply headmen of the outlying regions, but their connection with the king enhanced their status.

The tamrvac was an inspector; the officials who swore allegiance to Suryavarman I had this title, for example. The gunadosadarsin (assessor of virtues and defects) was concerned with temple property. A variety of functionaries were called khlon (inspector) and had responsibilities in various areas such as grain, temple dues, management of religious foundations and several aspects of court proceedings. Revenue was usually in kind, being paid in grain, but some special districts paid in other commodities such as honey and wax. There is evidence that some of the categories in which officials were placed were not types of professional specialisation but divisions of the government service placed under the patronage of particular chiefs belonging to the royal family, a system that was indeed known in later centuries. Some of the groups of dignitaries named in named in the inscriptions, again, appear to have been the bearers of hereditary privileges in the royal household; the term varna, for example, designates any of a number of orders of dignity, which have such official functions as religious teachers, performers of rites, door guardians, garden keepers, palace servants, bearers of flywhisks, and artists.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-88"><a href="#cite_note-88">[88]</a></sup> 'As in the rest of the Indic world, the Angkor state and empire were government by rules laid down in the Code of Manu, a great compendium of Brahmanic law probably composed around the 4th century BC. [...] Every judicial act was theoretically inscribed on stone as well as on plaques of gold, silver or copper. The Khmer king was the defender of the law and order in Cambodia. His law courts, present on every administrative level right down tot he village, instituted criminal proceedings against transgressors and guaranteed the integrity of landholdings and the settling of boundary problems. Not even religious institutions such as temples were immune, sine they as well as private individuals could be sued over land.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-89"><a href="#cite_note-89">[89]</a></sup> 'Below all of this ponderous bureaucracy were the free people of the land, free in the sense that they enjoyed basic civil rights, and could settle wherever they wished. Nonetheless, the obligations of this largely rice-farming class were heavy; the entire able-bodied population between the ages of 20 and 50 owed up to 90 days of core labour annually. Those outside these age limits were called up for only light labour. Exempt from corvee were the monks, Brahmins, the Brah Van, the mandarins and their servants, and all employees of the king. There was no escaping this core, since all males were inscribed by name on census registers that were revised every three years under supervision of the roving commission. At this point, every person would also choose a particular mandarin or even high official in the capital as his patron. With this personage, who was not necessarily connected with the client's territory, there were mutual obligations: the client owed the patron deference, and respect, services, occasional labour, and the usual small gifts, while the latter gave aid and protection (even legal) to the freeman and accommodation when he had to travel to the capital. It was this system through which corvees were mustered, and foot soldiers called up for Cambodia's many wars.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-90"><a href="#cite_note-90">[90]</a></sup>

Even though there may not have ventured into the Tonle Sap lake, the large planked vessel represented in the Bayon indicates that large vessels arrived in Angkorian ports.

During his later years at least he does not seem to have had all Chenla under his control; for, in a reign of perhaps more than 40 years, with more inscriptions than any other king before Yasovarman I, the inscriptions of his reign seem but once or twice to get away from the immediate region of the Mekong and its route to its port.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-157"><a href="#cite_note-157">[157]</a></sup> According to Coe (2003), iron was used in weaponry, including knives, spears and arrowheads since Iron Age chiefdoms (c. 500 BC to c. 200-500 CE).

There was no standing army - in times of war, the patron was expected to muster a force of his clients, and place himself or an officer designated by the king at the head. The arms that they bore were substantially like those wielded by Classic warriors, with the addition of firearms and canon (after 1600). Again the principle of five ruled, as there were five corps: the vanguard, the rear guard, the right flank, the left flank, and the central corps or main body of the army, where the king kept himself with his war elephants. These animals were strengthened magically from time to time by bring sprayed with water mixed with human bile (or so say our sources); magical ideas also led the warriors to cover themselves with protective amulets.

Even to the end of its architectural greatness, except for walls, gates, towers, etc., Cambodia used stone and brick for religious constructions only. This was because their architects did not know the principle of the true arch and used the "false arch," also known as overlapping or corbelling: i.e., from opposite sides, each succeeding pair of bricks or stones projected over the opening to be vaulted until the gap was small enough to be closed by a single brick or stone.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-218"><a href="#cite_note-218">[218]</a></sup> 'This royal city [Angkor Thom] probably resembled the Forbidden City of Beijing: a walled complex contain- ing religious and administrative officials and religious sanctuaries.

An hereditary kingship commanded an extreme, formalised social hierarchy in which status and privileges were awarded in the form of titles, posts, and prestige items. Skilled workers such as weavers, builders and sculptors were paid according to their social rank which was partly based on who their parents were rather than demand for their product. Most of the surplus-producing temple institutions in this period were founded from the top down: by and for the royals and the wealthy class. These were maintained by temple workers (knum) who could be bought and sold like slaves. There also were non-knum slaves.

Kingship was largely hereditary, yet the practice of primogeniture was not always applied. It seems that “election” of a new king by a committee of royal family members, senior officials, and monks probably predates the modern period (Osborne 1973, 169). In the Theravada ideology of kingship the right to rule is a consequence of spiritual maturity. From this perspective, the prerogatives of the king, once appointed, may not easily be challenged by thisworldly considerations, such as political expediency. The king also possesses the power to “master the earth spirits” (Forest 1980, 57). Therefore he may bend the forces of nature to his will. In this way rain will fall at the correct time, good harvests are guaranteed, and calamity is avoided.

This transition involved a process of contralization instituted by the overlord Jayavarman II (ruled 802 to 834). Jayavarman seems to have identified a means of unifying formerly competing overlords that was rooted first in military conquest, then by placing his followers in positions of authority. This had the effect of establishing a central rule through replacing independent polities by provinces. He also must have appreciated the importance of stressing the mystical properties of kingship by instituting the cult of the kamraten jagat ta raja, meaning "the god who is king." Deification of the ruler, linked with vesting the rights to consecrate a new god-king in successive members of a given family, meant that the succession should be assured. Remarkably, the ensuing five centuries witnessed a considerable degree of legitimacy in the succession, being largely confined to members of the aristocratic lineage of Aninditapura.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-231"><a href="#cite_note-231">[231]</a></sup> 'In the Angkor Cambodia realm, a symbolic ‘‘Mount Mahendra/Meru’’ temple mountain became the ritual home of the devaraja in the cult of Jayavarman II in the early ninth century—a cult that inclusively incorporated and subordinated worship of local deities to the king’s worship of Siva (see chapter 6). As the traditional abode of ancestor spirits, mountains were already considered sacred by indigenous tradition. By patronizing the external god Siva, who was known in Indian philosophy as the Lord of the Mountains and for his association with fertility, the kings reinforced their local stature. It remained for Cambodian kings to link themselves ritually with this mountain, the domicile of the ancestors and Siva, and thereby make a profound statement about their ability to guarantee the flow of life-power from the realm of the ancestors—and Siva—to their subjects.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-232"><a href="#cite_note-232">[232]</a></sup>
