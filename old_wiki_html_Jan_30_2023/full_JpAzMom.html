<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="General_Description">General Description</span></h4>
<dl><dd>The Azuchi-Momoyama period (1568-1603 CE), also known as the Shokuho period, is named for the castles built by the warrior rulers Oda Nobunaga (Azuchi) and Toyotomi Hideyoshi (Momoyama).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-9"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> The Azuchi-Momoyama period marked the beginning of a process of national unification after the disorder of the Warring States period.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> The period starts with the rise to power of the military commander and regional lord Oda Nobunaga. With his defeat of the shogun Ashikaga Yoshiaki, he set about bringing the lesser <i>daimyō</i> (lords) under the control of a single military command.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-12"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> In 1568 Nobunaga marched on, and occupied, the imperial capital of Kyoto, gaining effective control of the government.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-13"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>After the death of Nobunaga in 1582, his general Toyotomi Hideyoshi continued this process, gaining control of most of Japan by 1590 CE. In an attempt to expand Japan's territory overseas, Hideyoshi led two unsuccessful invasions of Korea in 1592 and 1597.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-14"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> Hideyoshi's death in 1598, leaving a council of lords in charge until his young son came of age, sparked off a succession struggle. The general Tokugawa Ieyasu, a former ally of Oda Nobunaga, emerged victorious from the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, cementing his power. After his victory, he was appointed shogun in 1603, founding the Tokugawa Shogunate which would dominate Japan for the next 200 years.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-15"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p><i>Population and political organization</i>
</p>
<dl><dd>While the generals Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu consolidated power into a military confederation, the emperor remained the nominal head of state throughout the period.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-16"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> Although the older social order remained largely intact, with peasants subservient to feudal lords, Oda Nobunaga's policy of annexing lands and awarding them to his loyal retainers reshaped the power relations between lords and enabled the consolidation of his own power.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> Toyotomi Hideyoshi was instrumental in creating a strict and finely graded social hierarchy of warriors, farmers, artisans, and merchants, a structure that would be institutionalized in the succeeding Tokugawa period.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-18"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Population estimates for the area under Azuchi-Momoyama control range from roughly 17 million in 1500 CE to 22 million in 1600 CE.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-19"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> The imperial capital, Kyoto, remained the largest settlement with approximately 300,000 inhabitants.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-20"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup></dd></dl>

The area under ‘unified’ rule expanded very rapidly in this period, even going beyond Japan’s ‘traditional’ boundaries for a brief period in the 1590s as a result of Toyotomi Hideyoshi’s invasions of the Korean peninsula. However upon Hideyoshi’s death, all attempts to conquer Korea were abandoned, and  Japan’s national territory reverted to more or less the same dimensions as in the medieval period—the three islands of Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu, plus the southern tip of Hokkaido. At least in a formal, political sense, this national territory remained more or less unchanged until the end of the eighteenth century. <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-22"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>

This occurred in part because castle towns served as government administration centres. Many daimyo and almost all samurai lived within the castle town complexes.

'For the nearly 700-year span of Japan’s medieval and early modern periods, warriors-with varying levels of effectiveness and hegemony-ruled the country. Although the fortunes of particular extended warrior families waxed and waned, only members of the warrior class could serve as shoguns, the military rulers. Their governments, known commonly as shogunates, were often challenged by the interests of other powerful warrior families in various parts of Japan and by the imperial family in Kyoto. Although the warrior bureaucracy largely controlled the affairs of the state, the emperor and the imperial court were still the formal head of government. Warrior governments typically sought out- or forced-the formal imperial decrees that gave legitimacy to the shoguns. Occasionally emperors would attempt to reassert direct imperial rule. They were, however, always suppressed in favor of warrior rule... Warrior governments functioned as a lord-vassal system of loyalty. This is reflected in the political structures of the different shogunates. Although they varied greatly in their organization, the notion of loyalty, whether earned or forced, always laid the foundation on which the warrior government was built.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-33"><a href="#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup> 'Hideyoshi is remembered as the creator of institutions that became the building blocks for the subsequent Tokugawa hegemony.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-34"><a href="#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup>

</p><p>‘High office in one of the gozan monasteries brought distinction to a monk, his family, and patrons. Clearly, many monks wanted the title of abbot or senior administrator but not the obligations that went with the office. Finding and maintaining talented monastic leadership thus remained a critical problem for the gozan institution and its secular sponsors. And the problem was compounded by the fact that the shogunate collected a fee each time it issued a certificate of appointment to an abbot.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-35"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup>

One or more of these pieces is turned back in front to form ear guards, fukigayeshi. The front is usually decorated with two horn-like pieces, kuwagata, representing the leaves of a water plant; between them is an ornament, maidate, corresponding to the European crest. The face is covered by a steel mask, menpo, to which a laminated neck guard, yodare-kake, is attached. There are five varieties of menpo - covering the entire face - all of the face below the eyes - the forehead and cheeks only - and two for the cheeks and chin only. Of these, the second is much most used. A gorget, nodowa, was sometimes worn but was not considered as a regular part of the suit.

It tells the story of the birth of the kami, especially the birth of Amaterasu, the sun goddess, from whom the Japanese imperial family - and by extension the Japanese people - are descended. The narrative tells of how Ninigi no Mikoto, grandson of Amaterasu Omikami, was sent to establish sovereignty over the Japanese islands. It was Ninigi’s great grandson, Jimmu, who became, according to the narrative, the first emperor of Japan. All Japanese emperors are said to descend from this sacred line beginning with Amaterasu. The three regalia - mirror, sword, and jewel - the symbols of imperial ruling authority, are said to have originated with Amaterasu who started the tradition of passing these symbols to each subsequent ruler. In the medieval and early modern periods (in fact, up until 1945), this Kojiki narrative was used to argue the legitimacy of the imperial family as rightful rulers." <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-132"><a href="#cite_note-132">[132]</a></sup>
