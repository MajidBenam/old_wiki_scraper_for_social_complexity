<p><b>♠ RA ♣ Daniel Mullins; WalkerV; Enrico Cioni ♥</b> EC contributed general description.
</p><p><b> ♠ Original name  ♣ Funan I ♥ </b> 'No one knows what the Chinese word 'Fu-nan' represents. The country to which it refers appears to have had its heartland in the Mekong delta area. The Chinese describe it as an empire, with a number of vassal states; since modern scholars doubt whether this is correct, they treat the Chinese information with suspicion, and the name 'Fu-nan' belongs in inverted commas.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> 'Chinese records noted a maritime kingdom situated on the lower reaches of the Mwaekong that flourished from the third to seventh cen- turies C.E. Referred to as FUNAN, this polity is believed to be the intermediary of the sea-going trade between IMPERIAL CHINA to the east and INDIA to the west.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> 'The name of Funan is first mentioned in the Sanguo zhi, which was compiled in the late 3rd century and covers the period 220-280 AD.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Alternative names  ♣ bnam; biennium; vnam; Culture of Oc Eo ♥ </b> 'One of the best-known states controlled the strategic Mekong Delta (Higham 2001). Called Funan by the Chinese, it incorporated large walled cities linked by canals stretching for tens of kilometers across the flat deltaic landscape.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> 'In his opening paragraphs on Funan is his major synthesis, Coedes wrote that 'Funan' was derived from the Khmer word bnam/vnam, "mountain" [...]'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> 'The phrase “Culture of Oc Èo” is used to denote the culture that emerged and developed in this delta area throughout the first half of the first millen- nium C.E., as exhibited by the uncovering of more than 300 sites.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> 'FUNAN. This is the modern pronunciation of Chinese characters used in texts from the third to the seventh centuries to denote a kingdom centered in the lower Mekong Valley (see map 7). In ancient times they were probably pronounced biunâm, which is a good approxima- tion of the Khmer word bnam, now pronounced phnom and meaning “mountain.”'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Peak Date  ♣ 250-514 CE ♥ </b> 'During its heyday during the mid-third century, FUNAN dominated modern-day southern Vietnam, Cambodia, central Thailand, and northern West Malaysia'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> 'At the height of its power in the mid-third century, Funan is also thought to have controlled some of the major ports on the Malay Peninsula and to have been influential in the development of maritime trade between India and China.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-9"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> 'Fu-nan appears to have reached the peak of its fortunes sometime in the fourth century, prior to the instigation of a competitive, all-sea route from India to China that went through the Straits of Melaka.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> 'The predecessors of Pre-Angkor and the Angkorian Empire, the trading centres in Funan, also said to be underpinned by rice surpluses (Fox and Ledgerwood 1999; Stark 2006: 100), reached their greatest prosperity in the mid 3rd century, with Chinese envoys noting their wealth.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> '478-514  Funan is at its geographic, political, and economic zenith under the  reign of King Jayavarman.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-12"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> 'The Kingdom of Funan reaches its height during the rule of Fan Shih-Man, extending from  contemporary Malaysia to Burma.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-13"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> 'Jayavarman is also known for having reigned over Funan during the kingdom’s period of greatest strength and size in the late fifth-early sixth centuries. Indeed in 502 after sending tribute to the Chinese court, including a Buddha statue made of coral, Jayavarman succeeded his son Fan Tang as “General of the Pacified South”; as general Jayavarman sent more tribute to the Chinese court in 511 and 514.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-14"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Temporal_bounds">Temporal bounds</span></h4>
<p><b> ♠ Duration  ♣ 225-540 CE ♥ </b> Chinese records dating from the 3rd century C.E., beginning with the Sānguó zhì (Records of the Three Kingdoms) completed in AD 289 by Chén Shòu (233-297), record the arrival of two Funanese embassies at the court of Lǚ Dài, governor in the southern Chinese kingdom of Wú: the first embassy arrived between 225 and 230 AD, the second in the year 243.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-15"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> The last Funan king was historically attested in 539 CE. 'According to the Chinese accounts, the last king of Funan was called Rudravarman and he was chiefly distinguished in their eyes because he offered the gift of a live rhinoceros to the Emperor at Beijing in 539 AD. After this, the historical record becomes somewhat blurred. For many years, it was believed that Funan declined or disappeared because it was threatened by the rise of another, more powerful state called Chenla or Zhenla to the north.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-16"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> Note: 'Chenla' is the old spelling, the modern romanization of the Chinese character is 'Zhenla'. <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> 'Late in sixth century, 'Fu-nan' disappears from the Chinese record, and its place is taken by the Khmer city-states further north where minor rajas competed for hegemony.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-18"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> 'In the 6th century Southeast Asian shipping to China linking China, Southeast Asia, and India began to shift from coastal sailing along the shores of Vietnam, Cambodia, and the peninsula, to a direct route across the South China Sea from Indonesia to southern China and northern Vietnam. Funan, the coastal polity dependent on maritime trade, apparently collapsed and was replaced in Cambodia by an entity known to the Chinese as 'Chenla', a state, or group of states, or pon-led communities based on the control of land and people, and extracting wealth from agriculture, and possibly inter-community trade, with little involvement in maritime activities.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-19"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> 'In the lower reaches of the Mekong River in Vietnam, between the delta area and the Gulf of Thailand (Siam), lies OC ÈO, an archaeological site generally believed to be FUNAN, a kingdom that flourished in the third through seventh centuries C.E., hitherto known only through written source materials.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-20"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> 'The CHINESE TRIBUTE SYSTEM was imposed on FU-NAN from the fourth century until its demise in the latter half of the sixth century.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-21"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> 'Following the decline of Funan sea power by about the sixth century, the Khmers turned inland, to the country’s agricultural regions.'(<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-22"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> 'It is clear, however, that in the third century the great expansion of Funan towards the Malay peninsula during which it subdued, or rather relegated to vassal status, a number of small states, gave way in the succeeding centuries to a reduction in the extent of its territory, ending around the fourth or fifth centuries in an area restricted to the southern parts of today's Cambodia and Vietnam.' [...] Thus Funan at the beginning of the sixth century would appear to have shrunk to what must have been its original core, the Mekong delta areas of today's Cambodia and Vietnam.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-23"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> 'In 550 CE Chitrasena, borther of king Bhavarma, royal descendant of Hun Tian [Skt. Kaundinya] invaded Te Mu from the northern mountains bringing about the subsequent decline of the Fu Nan kingdom and the beginning of the Zhenla, at about 550-630 CE.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-24"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> 'It dates to about 100-550 C.E. and was located on the delta of the Mekong and Bassac Rivers in modern Cambodia and Vietnam.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-25"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> '205-225 CE: Rule of Fan Shih-Man, who draws other principalities into the  Funan orbit and is considered by some as the kingdom’s greatest ruler.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-26"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ confederated state ♥ </b>
</p>
<dl><dd>'This passage gives the impression of Fu-nan as an empire, but modern scholars are distrustful of such a portrayal. It is likely that the communities involved were all relatively small city-states scattered along the coast; they could conduct raids upon one another, but there were no great tracts of territory settled by agriculturalist, and it is not likely that centralized control could extend over a large area. [...] Fu-nan, then, was less likely a dominant empire than the largest and most aggressive of a number of principalities.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-27"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>'We do not know if Funan was a unitary state, as the Chinese descriptions seem to suggest, or a series of competing centers. Whichever was the case, certain trends are found which were to contribute to the character of later complex polities in Southeast Asia. The handful of surviving inscriptions, for example, indicates that the local rulers adopted Sanskrit language and took Sanskrit names. Indian religious and legal systems were adopted as well.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-28"><a href="#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup> 'There was a taxation system involving payment in gold, silver, perfumes, and pearls, and a script which originated in India.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-29"><a href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>'Some historians suspect that the Chinese assumed that Funan’s political structure was more centralized than was really the case. No territorially based polities can be found in Southeast Asia before the imperial era of Angkor in the 11th and 12th centuries. It is unlikely that Funan was such a kingdom. More likely it was a typical early Southeast Asian mandala, in which political power manifested itself in the form of ability to extract tribute and occasional other tokens of subservience, but not direct rule of distant provinces. It is impossible to tell whether Funan could be defined as a unified state or as a cluster of small polities in the delta. Evidence in favor of territorial organization covering at least the lower Mekong includes extensive remains of a canal network and signs of the emergence of an elite stimulated by trade involving resources brought downriver from the hinterland.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-30"><a href="#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>'We should think of Funan, therefore, not as a centralised kingdom extending from southern Vietnam all the way around to the Kra Isthmus, but rather as a mandala, the power of whose capital in southeastern Cambodia waxed and waned, and whose armed merchant ships succeeded in enforcing its temporary suzerainty over small coastal trading ports around the Gulf of Thailand. What gave Funan the edge over other such centres of power was clearly its position astride the India-China trade route. Its power, however, is unlikely to have spread far inland. Further north, on the middle Mekong and on the lower Chao Phraya River, other power centres were establishing themselves that in time would challenge and replace Funan.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-31"><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>'The pre-Angkor scholar Michael Vickery has warned against assuming that Funan was a unified state—it is possible that it was a loose alliance of port towns in the lower Mekong delta. However, the existence of large canals suggests a strong state power capable of planning and managing the large numbers of labourers required for such projects. Such workforces would have depended on regular food supplies, produced by efficient agriculture and with an efficient tax collection system. On the other hand, we know that the city-states of Ancient Greece and Renaissance Italy were capable of building public works and large monuments without direction by overarching ‘national’ or supra-national polities, so Vickery is probably right about pre-Angkorean Cambodia.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-32"><a href="#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup> 'The area was occupied in the prehistoric period, and the inhabitants prospered with the control of the international maritime trade to create a vigorous and powerful state.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-33"><a href="#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup> 'Chinese sources awarded this area, known as “Funan,” an exaggerated political solidity, for in truth what Chinese writers, eager to flatter their emperor, described as a substantial tributary kingdom seems to have been no more than an unstable network of superficially Indianized ports and small principalities'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-34"><a href="#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>'Combining the assumptions of Chinese sources with their own bias in favor of consolidated states, early European scholars portrayed Champa as a unified kingdom, with a hierarchy of provincial functionaries and a centralized administration.19 Recent research has substantially modi- fied that view, preferring to see Champa (like neighboring Funan) even at its height as a loose confederation of local polities which might com- bine for longer or shorter periods under powerful leaders, but which retained a basic autonomy grounded in the self-sufficiency of small east-west river valleys and isolated coastal plains, and perhaps in an irreducibly polycentric world view. Not infrequently, Cham principali- ties fought one another. A hegemon became merely “king of the kings (raja di raja) of Champa,” and the location of the preeminent center - when such a center existed - shifted: in the 8th century, which may have seen the first sustained coalescence, Panduranga dominated, in the late 9th century Indrapura, after c. 1000 Vijaya, and in the 16th century Kauthara and Panduranga.20 It would be foolish to assume that Cham political structures remained frozen for centuries.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-35"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> 'The elements of a social overlay to the archaeological record are found in the surviving texts: we read of kings, a legal system, taxation, warfare and sujugation of rivals.

<dl><dd>Because it is difficult to pinpoint precisely when Funan was founded, here we use 225 CE as our start date.

This is the last time a Funanese ruler is mentioned in any existing records, and indeed it seems that Funan entered a period of gradual decline around this time, until it was supplanted by the Northern Cambodian state of Chenla or Zhenla in the 7th century.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-71"><a href="#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup> Chenla is the older spelling, the modern romanization of the Chinese character is Zhenla. <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-72"><a href="#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Funan was rather prosperous, due to its privileged position at the crossroads of important trade routes that linked with India and China. Sources suggest that it reached its peak either in the mid-3rd century (when it extended its influence into Malaysia)<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-73"><a href="#cite_note-73">[73]</a></sup> or between the end of the 5th and the beginning of the 6th century (when it was ruled by King Kaundinya Jayavarman and reached its maximum territorial extent, as well as the zenith of its political and economic power).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-74"><a href="#cite_note-74">[74]</a></sup></dd></dl>

</p><p><b> ♠ Religious levels ♣ 2 ♥ </b> levels. There was a progressive change in religious cults in the area of Funan, the most radical one being the abandonment of inhumation practices in favour of cremation. The funerary practices incorporated gold leaves decorated with human forms with raised hands, one of which appears to represent Harihara, the combined image of Shiva and Vishnu.  <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-89"><a href="#cite_note-89">[89]</a></sup> This change seems to be in effect toward the 5th century CE, at the same time that Funanese rulers started to take on the Sanskrit honorific title of -varman (protected by, protege of). Indian gods were incorporated into the Funanese pantheon, particularly Siva, Visnu, and Buddha. The phallic symbol that represented Siva, the linga, was perceived as being the essence of the mandala. <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-90"><a href="#cite_note-90">[90]</a></sup>. NOTE: data from ethnographic studies suggest that there was a pre-Indian religious strata that was eventually merged with Indian religions to become what today comprises the Khmer world view. In Khmer culture the world is divided into two landscapes that are marked by physical and psychological borders: the landscape of the village (srok) and the landscape of the wilderness (prei). The srok is the domesticated space of humans; the village, the paddy rice fields, a space of social organization <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-91"><a href="#cite_note-91">[91]</a></sup> that is under the control of a Buddhist king  <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-92"><a href="#cite_note-92">[92]</a></sup>.

This division is not immutable: forests can be cleared to create new srok, and a village may be overtaken by the forest and regain its position as prei. This perception of the world has been identified as the pre-Indian stratum of Khmer culture <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-95"><a href="#cite_note-95">[95]</a></sup>. The term srok is recorded in the inscriptions as sruk, and defines a geographical/administrative entity. <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-96"><a href="#cite_note-96">[96]</a></sup> Currently, the person in charge of establishing dialogues and interactions with the spirits is known as rup <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-97"><a href="#cite_note-97">[97]</a></sup>. It is therefore possible to suggest that before merging Indian and local religions, the early Funanese people may have had a structured religious world view with levels, that is, with the presence of particular people who could act as intermediaries with the spirits. These hierarchical levels increased as the cult to Indian gods were incorporated.

</p><p><b> ♠ Professional priesthood ♣ inferred present ♥ </b>There was a progressive change in religious cults in the area of Funan, the most radical one being the abandonment of inhumation practices in favour of cremation. The funerary practices incorporated gold leaves decorated with human forms with raised hands, one of which appears to represent Harihara, the combined image of Shiva and Vishnu.  <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-104"><a href="#cite_note-104">[104]</a></sup> This change seems to be in effect toward the 5th century CE, at the same time that Funanese rulers started to take on the Sanskrit honorific title of -varman (protected by, protege of). Indian gods were incorporated into the Funanese pantheon, particularly Siva, Visnu, and Buddha. The phallic symbol that represented Siva, the linga, was perceived as being the essence of the mandala. <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-105"><a href="#cite_note-105">[105]</a></sup>.  NOTE: data from ethnographic studies suggest that there was a pre-Indian religious strata that was eventually merged with Indian religions to become what today comprises the Khmer world view. In Khmer culture the world is divided into two landscapes that are marked by physical and psychological borders: the landscape of the village (srok) and the landscape of the wilderness (prei). The srok is the domesticated space of humans; the village, the paddy rice fields, a space of social organization <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-106"><a href="#cite_note-106">[106]</a></sup> that is under the control of a Buddhist king  <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-107"><a href="#cite_note-107">[107]</a></sup>. The prei, on the other hand, is the forest, a place of uncertainty dominated by wild and dangerous spirits <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-108"><a href="#cite_note-108">[108]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-109"><a href="#cite_note-109">[109]</a></sup> beyond the control of Buddhism. This division is not immutable: forests can be cleared to create new srok, and a village may be overtaken by the forest and regain its position as prei. This perception of the world has been identified as the pre-Indian stratum of Khmer culture <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-110"><a href="#cite_note-110">[110]</a></sup>. The term srok is recorded in the inscriptions as sruk, and defines a geographical/administrative entity. <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-111"><a href="#cite_note-111">[111]</a></sup> Currently, the person in charge of establishing dialogues and interactions with the spirits is known as rup <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-112"><a href="#cite_note-112">[112]</a></sup>. It is therefore possible to suggest that before merging Indian and local religions, the early Funanese people may have had a structured religious world view with levels, that is, with the presence of particular people who could act as intermediaries with the spirits. These hierarchical levels increased as the cult to Indian gods were incorporated. (

This pattern encouraged communities, as they grew in size and popu- lation numbers, to control water flows, usually by build- ing up earthen dikes to form reservoirs. These banks ring many large Iron Age sites, and where dated, fall within 1 to 400 C.E. During the life of the states of FUNAN and CHENLA, water was retained in rectangular reservoirs known as BARAYS.

These display knowledge of Indian intellectual and political thought and of literature including the metrics of poetry (Majumdar 1953: xvii-iii; Bhattacharya 1991: 2-4; Pollock 1996: 218-220; Dagens 2003: 217).'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-172"><a href="#cite_note-172">[172]</a></sup></dd></dl>

Jacq-Hergoualc’h (2007: 85) states that ‘perhaps these animal figures corresponded to the desire of the warriors to place themselves under the protection of this or that revered animal’. It may be that these animals are regional or clan signifiers. At Phum Snay buffalo iconography was very common, especially in the form of finger rings, on bronze bells and on epaulettes.

<p><b>♠ Rulers are legitimated by gods ♣ present ♥</b> 'Thus, after consolidating his position, whether by force or by offering access to new economic and culturally meaningful resources, the successful Southeast Asian chief would begin to practice Hindu asceticism to further enhance the local perception of his spiritual superiority. The local ruler’s ascetic achievements and ritual performances demonstrated his close relationship not only with the indigenous ancestors and spirits, but also with the celestial and universal Indic deities. In the early Southeast Asian polities the most significant of these deities was the god Siva, whom early mainland inscriptions depict as not only the source of fertility but also the patron of ascetic meditation and the supreme lord of the universe. Rulers of ascetic achievement were characterized in their inscriptions as Siva’s spiritual authorities on earth, and since Siva’s authority over all that exists was absolute, in theory the rulers’ own powers on earth had no limit (Tingley: 2009, 132, 144). The ruler’s claims to partake of divinity took his followers beyond their existing relationships with ancestors and local chthonic spirits, holding out the potential rewards of a relationship with an omnipotent Indian divine. Due to the political attractiveness of these notions, Southeast Asia’s early rulers focused not on the development of state institutions of secular scholarship, but rather on the institution of religious cults that allowed followers to draw inspiration on the leader’s spiritual relationships. Local populations responded by rallying behind these spiritually endowed leaders, who were supported by a blend of local and Indian cultural symbols and values. Successful leaders were therefore able to use these symbols and values to mobilize local populations for various intraregional adventures.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-274"><a href="#cite_note-274">[274]</a></sup> 'Most early Southeast Asian rulers borrowed from Hinduism the idea that the king was the representative on earth of the great god Shiva (or more rarely Vishnu).

Kings thus set out to recreate in microcosm the macrocosmic geography of the divine realm, with the palace at the centre representing the abode of the gods on Mount Meru, the world axis. The impressive rituals at which they officiated only added to their aura of cosmic power. Belief in karma and reincarnation provided further legitimisation. Karma as an inexorable natural law of moral cause and effect provided an explanation for both individual fortune and social status.

Kings thus set out to recreate in microcosm the macrocosmic geography of the divine realm, with the palace at the centre representing the abode of the gods on Mount Meru, the world axis. The impressive rituals at which they officiated only added to their aura of cosmic power. Belief in karma and reincarnation provided further legitimisation. Karma as an inexorable natural law of moral cause and effect provided an explanation for both individual fortune and social status. The king ruled as king because through previous lifetimes he had accumulated the necessary karma to do so. In this way karma powerfully reinforced social hierarchy, for everyone was born into the social situation they deserved.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-282"><a href="#cite_note-282">[282]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Ideological thought equates elites and commoners ♣ absent ♥</b> "The Hinduism that flourished in Southeast Asia emphasized reincarnation, the accumulation of a balance sheet weighing the consequences of an individual’s actions through the procession of lives (karma), the impermanent nature of reality, ritual practices, hereditary social classes (called in India the caste system by later observers), and the powerful role of the priestly caste, known as brahmans." <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-283"><a href="#cite_note-283">[283]</a></sup> "There have been a number of attempts to underplay, to question, and to lampoon the hierarchical inequality and even the existence of the caste system. As we will also see it differs, in some degree, from region to region. However, the concepts of varna and, more importantly, jati lie at the heart of the caste system and they form an ideal core around which the complexity of detail and difference can then be erected. [...] Thus the four varnas are the Brahmins who represent priesthood and learning, the Kshatriyas who represent the warriors and kings, who protect the people, the Vaishyas who represent the people who engage in agriculture, farming and trade, and the Shudras who represent the servants who look after and serve the others. The Brahmins fulfil the function of the mouth, the Kshatriyas fulfil the function of the arms, the Vaishyas fulfil the function of the thighs, and the Shudras fulfil the function of the feet. The model is clearly a hierarchy but it is a complementary hierarchy and unity, wherein the different elements sustain one another. [...]In practice the key to the caste system are the sub-castes, or jatis. There are a great number of these in each varna, and in practice there is a hierarchy within each set so that only certain jatis can marry and eat with each other. Not all Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas or Shudras can marry or eat together. Those privileges are confined to a limited number of jatis within each varna. [...] Clearly there have been changes in the system over long centuries. Particular jatis have elevated themselves through economic means, through disputing status, through propaganda, through moving, through changing religion, and so on. But on the whole, over such a long period of time, the system has remained strong, especially in the villages. [...] The strength of the caste system has been enhanced by another principle emphasised by Dumont (1980) in his classical work entitled ‘’Homo Hierarchicus: The Caste System and its Implications’’. According to Dumont, in addition to the distinctions already outlined that fit varnas and jatis into hierarchies, another must be added. This distinction takes caste hierarchical divides beyond the kind of class distinctions found in eighteenth-century Britain or in the Ancien Regime in Europe, by stressing the opposition between purity and pollution. Caste difference, according to this classification, goes beyond class differences into this other realm of ritual purity and pollution. The Brahmins are the highest and purest varna, and the Dalits are the lowest, in that they are outside varna and are impure altogether. The other varnas rank in between. Pollution occurs in different ways. It occurs through bodily contact of one sort or another, with menstrual cycles, through birth and death, through emissions such as faeces, urine and saliva, and through contact with night-soil, dirty clothes, unswept rooms and so on. Thus marriage and sex have to function within the correct set of jatis in the correct varna. Polluting jobs such as laundering and sweeping are done by people of lower castes so that the blood of people of higher castes can remain ‘pure’. Equally menstrual activity among older women makes them more ‘impure’ than men or pre-menstrual virgins, and therefore women are more polluting than men. They will thus often live semi-separately while menstruating, during which time they will also avoid going to the temple and therefore ‘polluting’ the gods. Furthermore, untouchable Dalits were prohibited from entering many temples before the post-Independence freedom-of-temple-entry legislation and even now they are kept out of some temples in many villages. [...] It is also true to say that Dumont’s thesis suffers from exaggeration and other matters are important in discussing caste. Nevertheless, there is at least an element of truth in the notion that purity and pollution has relevance in any discussion of caste.” <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-284"><a href="#cite_note-284">[284]</a></sup></dd></dl>
