</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="General_Description">General Description</span></h4>
<p>The period of Sogdian and Bactrian history between the disintegration of the Greco-Bactrian kingdom in the late 2nd century BCE and the rise of the Kushan Empire in the 1st century CE is poorly understood. The region was politically fragmented and the local settled populations were subjected to nomadic invasions, notably by a group of pastoralists and traders known to us by their Chinese name, Yuezhi.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-18"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> The Yuezhi are also sometimes referred to as 'Tochari' by scholars who believe they spoke a Tocharian language, part of an extinct Indo-European language group.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-19"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> (Others argue that their original language was eastern Iranic or proto-Turkic.)<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-20"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup>
</p><p>In the mid-1st millennium BCE and perhaps even earlier, the Yuezhi were living on the steppes to the north of China.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-21"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> However, after coming into conflict with other nomadic groups, the Xiongnu and Wusun, they migrated towards Sogdiana.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-22"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> By 129 BCE, when the Han Chinese diplomat Zhang Qian visited the Yuezhi court on the Oxus river, they were ruling over a region that included parts of the old Hellenistic Greco-Bactrian kingdom.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-23"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>
</p><p>In the early 1st century CE, the first Kushan king, Kujula Kadphises, seized power and began ruling over south-eastern Sogdiana, marking the end of our Yuezhi period.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-24"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> Kujula Kadphises was probably a member of one of five Yuezhi factions or subtribes, which he succeeded in unifying through military conquest,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-25"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> but even this is disputed.
</p><p><i>Population and political organization</i>
</p><p>The Yuezhi in Bactria and Sogdiana seem to have been organized into a federation of five tribes that competed for political supremacy in the new territory.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-26"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> There is no written or numismatic evidence of a centralized Yuezhi state with a single paramount ruler before the rise of Kujula Kadphises.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-27"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> Historian Craig Benjamin has characterized Yuezhi control over the sedentary population of northern Bactria and Sogdia as that of a militarily superior ruling dynasty of nomads, 'pastoralist conquerors' whose 'nominal sovereignty' was acknowledged by the locals because they feared violence if they refused to submit.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-28"><a href="#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup>
</p><p>Secure estimates for the combined population of the ruling Yuezhi and the settled population under their control in this period are lacking.

</p><p>If we divide the Zarafshan valley between two realms we get about 15,000 km2 for each of them.

</p><p>"The five hsi-hou or regions where the five tribes established their presence were located on either side of the Amu Darya - approximately the territory included in modern Bactria, Southern Tajikistan and Southern Uzbekistan (Sogdiana). The Kabul region (Kao-fu) and Parthia were initially not occupied by any of the Yueh-chih tribes."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-30"><a href="#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup>
</p><p>On the area of southeastern Sogdiana which came under Yuezhi domination in this period: 'The next five hundred years of Sogdian history [after the Graeco-Bactrian period] are extremely obscure. There is basically no information on Sogdiana concerning this period other than what is related in the Chinese sources [...] Around 160-130 BCE, the region was crisscrossed by various waves of migratory nomads from the north, whether they were Iranian-speaking Saka or the Yuezhi from within China. Beginning in the first century BCE, most of Sogdiana was included in a larger nomadic state, centered on the middle Syr Darya, namely Kangju. On the other hand, the Yuezhi principalities and then the Kushan empire incorporated the southeast part of Sogdiana (south of the Hissar mountains), which thereafter left the Sogdian sphere and was attached to Bactria.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-31"><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup>

</p><p>If there were at least two realms within the Zarafshan basin then the population estimate should be divided between them (200,000). Another source suggests a federation of five tribes - so the estimate could also be divided between five (80,000). These figures presumably refer to the migrant population: how many inhabitants were there already living in the locales (if the invasion was not accompanied by genocide)? <span style="color:purple">(JR: Woodcock said that 'there is no evidence of any general or even local massacre of the ordinary Greek population [in Bactria] after the nomad victories'.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-32"><a href="#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup>)</span> Given the relatively small size of these polities, this latter estimate could be directly added to the total. The largest settlement size for Greco-Bactria 200 BCE currently is estimated about 25,000.
</p><p><br/>

Though little can be reconstructed about the latter, Greek religion, Hinduism, Zoroastrianism and Buddhism all make a clear distinction between elites and commoners. In Greek religion and philosophy, only mystery were truly egalitarian <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-94"><a href="#cite_note-94">[94]</a></sup>; Hinduism is well-known from its caste system <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-95"><a href="#cite_note-95">[95]</a></sup>; Zoroastrians believed that elites were cosmologically distinct from commoners ('The omniscient Mazdean religion is likened to a mighty tree with one trunk (the mean), two main boughs (action and abstention), three branches (good thoughts, good words, and good deeds), four small branches (the estates of the priests, warriors, husbandmen, and artisans), five roots (the lord of the house, the village headman, the tribal chieftain, the ruler, and the highest religious authority, the representative of Zoroaster on earth ...), and above them all the head of all heads ... the king of kings, the ruler of the whole world.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-96"><a href="#cite_note-96">[96]</a></sup>). Indeed, this fits well with what little is known about Kushan social structure" "There is some direct, and a great deal of indirect, evidence to show that the commune occupied an important place in the socio-economic life of Central Asia and in the ancient East as a whole. This seems to have continued until the Early Middle Ages, for which evidence is available. Thus, the commune in Sogdiana was known as naf; it consisted of the aristocracy (aza ̄t, azatkar), merchants (xvakar), and free peasants (who were members of the commune) and craftsmen (karikar). Of these three categories in the naf the highest status was enjoyed by the azat that is, persons of ‘high and noble birth’, the azatkar or free persons associated with the azat and the ‘children of the azat of aristocratic, noble origin’." <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-97"><a href="#cite_note-97">[97]</a></sup></dd></dl>

That prosociality was an important moral value in the Kushan empire may be inferred, perhaps, from the fact that it is promoted by all four of the above-mentioned world religions (not much is known about the Indo-Iranian cults, unfortunately). Buddhism: “The twofold benefit of living a morally good life is linked to a twofold motivation: ‘Protecting oneself, one protects others; protecting others, one protects oneself ’ - just as each acrobat in a balancing act protects his partner by concentrating on himself, and protects himself by concentrating on his partner (see SN 47:19). If we take care of our own spiritual development, we render a service to others; and if we develop love towards others, we thereby also help ourselves. Accordingly, it is explicitly stated, someone who pursues the path of salvation only for his or her own benefit is to be censured, while the one who follows the path for one’s own benefit and for the benefit of others is to be commended (see AN 7:64).” <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-99"><a href="#cite_note-99">[99]</a></sup> Hinduism: “According to Hindu Dharmashastras, of the four stages of life, the person who is at the householder stage is the anchor of society. The householder’s business is the maintenance and support of those in the other three stages of life: the students who have not yet entered into the world of work, the retirees who have seen the birth of grand- children and spotted their first gray hairs, and the renunciants, those who have left behind not only the world of work and material possession but who have also left behind family and self-interest for a life focused on spiritual freedom. Householders are the ones with material wealth, and their responsibility, their dharma, is to share it with others. [...] The link between the world of the householder and the world of the renunciant is gift giving—dana. The classic image is of the renouncer with the begging bowl, making the rounds for alms. On a daily basis, in Hindu society, food is given to sannyasins and sadhus, the world renouncers who have “cast off” from the settled world of “this shore.” ” <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-100"><a href="#cite_note-100">[100]</a></sup> “The philosophers taught various versions of the Golden Rule, whereas traditional Greek morality said it was best to help one’s friends and harm one’s enemies. The only philosopher I can think of who specifically advocates “helping people” over “living luxuriously” is the Stoic Musonius Rufus from the first century CE, but he may have been an innovator in that respect. In general the Greeks had no religious or philosophical teachings to compare with Jewish and Christian teachings about almsgiving, gleaning, or caring for “widows and orphans.” Greek cities sometimes gave stipends to orphans if their fathers had died in battle defending the city.  The most important traditional religious teaching on this subject was that the gods required people to treat “strangers and suppliants” well. That is, you should assist strangers who come to your door in need (and definitely not harm them). You can see this when Odysseus disguised as a beggar receives hospitality (Homer was a basic school text in the Hellenistic period) or in the Hellenistic myth of Baucis and Philemon, a very poor elderly couple who received two strangers and gave them hospitality. The strangers turned out to be Zeus and Hermes, who rewarded the couple. The belief that the gods “tested” humans by coming down to earth was common Hellenistic Asia Minor, where Paul and Barnabas were mistaken for Zeus and Hermes in disguise (Acts 14). Hellenistic philanthropy was closely tied to piety because the benefactions were usually things like sponsoring a festival or enhancing a sanctuary. Sponsoring a festival meant entertainment and free food distribution, but the main goal was not necessarily to help the poor—it was more to enhance the public good. I think it is very likely that the teachings of philosophers encouraged these sorts of activities, but of course the donors also benefited from increased prestige.” <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-101"><a href="#cite_note-101">[101]</a></sup> Zoroastrianism: Cantera says that 'from its very beginnings Zoroastrianism has developed an ethical imperative of assistance to the needy members of the community'.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-102"><a href="#cite_note-102">[102]</a></sup>
