In return for fighting rebels and Tibetans, the Uighurs expected vast sums of silk, as much as 230,000 bolts in a single year, and imperial princesses. Although the Uighurs also traded horses and presented “tribute goods” at the same time, the Tang found Uighur assistance very expensive, while Uighur troops were often as destructive as the rebels they were fighting." <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

<p>The Orkhon Valley lies either side of the Orkhon River, in north-central Mongolia. Between the 740s and the 840s, this region was controlled by the Uighur khaganate, notably one of only two polities ever to adopt Manichaeism as the official state cult.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-13"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> The Uighur khaganate was relatively centralized, and included a tax collection system, but leaders often served both civil and military functions, and local rulers often enjoyed considerable autonomy.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-14"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>
</p><p>No population estimates specific to this polity could be found in the literature, though, according to McEvedy and Jones, at that time Mongolia and Siberia together likely had a population of no more than 500,000.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-15"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>

</p><p>"Yet a few further and more specific comments may be worthwhile. A Chinese source records the situation in 745 as follows: " The eastern extremity was [the territory of] the Shih-wei, the western, the Altai Mountains, and the southern controlled the Gobi Desert so it covered the entire territory of the ancient Hsiung-nu."9 This passage shows that the Chinese emperor recognized the territorial gains which the kaghan had recently made. It is unfortu­ nately a somewhat vague statement since the Altai Mountains and the Gobi both cover a large territory, but it certainly suggests that the extent of the Uighur empire was substantial. The Shih-wei lived south of the Kerulen River. A northern limit is not specified, but probably the kaghan assumed that his possessions ran at least as far as Lake Baikal, into which the Orkhon River flows. The territory of the Uighurs was expanded west with the firmer cooynquest of the Basmil and Karluk and then remained constant at least until the death of Tun bagha. The loss of Beshbalik and its aftermath appear to have reduced the extent of the Uighur empire drastically. We are told that the Karluk "over­ came [the territory round] the Fou-t'u Valley and seized it from the Uighurs."1 0 This valley was probably northwest of Mt. Ótükán,1 1 the sacred forest of the Turkic peoples, and dangerously close to Karabalghasun. In any case, the extent of Uighur alarm over the loss of the Fou-t'u may be gauged from the following comments of the Chinese historian: "The Uighurs trem­bled with fear and moved all the northwestern tribes, with their sheep and their horses, to the south of their ral camp in order to escape from them [the Karluk]." <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>

Karabalghasun.
"It is certain, however, that Karabalghasun developed into quite an impressive city. It contained a royal palace, which appears from the Shine-usu inscription (south side, line 10) to have been built at about the same time as the city itself, and was completely walled. Tamim records that "the town has twelve iron gates of huge size. The town is populous and thickly crowded and has markets and various trades."4 2 He adds that it was dominated by a golden tent, which could be seen from some distance outside the city. It stood on the flat top of the palace and could hold 100 people. At least part of the Uighur community had forsaken its nomadic past. Even outside the great cities of the west like Kocho and Beshbalik, a settled urban civilization was being developed." <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-19"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>

<p>"Associated with the growth of agriculture we find the development of towns, the presence of which is well attested in the passage just quoted. We know also two important cities built on the initiative of Uighur kaghans. One of them was Bay-Balik [lit. "Rich Town"], to which I referred earlier. Work on its construction was started in 757 upon an order from kaghan. The other was Karabalghasun, built at about the same time. Both, then, were completed under Mo-yen-ch'o kaghan, so that the process of urbanization must have begun very quickly after the empire was founded. Very little is known about Bay-Balik, and its precise significance for the Uighurs is unclear. It is certain, however, that Karabalghasun developed into quite an impressive city. It contained a royal palace, which appears from the Shine-usu inscription (south side, line 10) to have been built at about the same time as the city itself, and was completely walled.

They were expected to be abstemious, kind and generous in giving alms, but were allowed to eat normally and to keep a wife. An auditor who had fulfilled his duties would be reincarnated, after death, as an elect.

It reached impressive proportions about 760 and became one of the most important aspects of their mutual relations. A Chinese historian explains its development as follows: The Uighurs, taking advantage of their service to China [during the An Lu-shan rebellion], frequently used to send embassies with horses to trade at an agreed price for silken fabrics. Usually they came every year, trading one horse for forty pieces of silk. Every time they came they brought several tens of thousands of horses [. . .] The barbarians acquired silk insatiably and we were given useless horses. The court found it extremely galling.44 This was a forced trade, of far greater value to the Uighurs than to the Chinese, and continued throughout the period of the Uighur empire. Most of the vast quantity of silk involved could be re-exported to other countries or function as a form of currency. But some of it was possibly used among the urban rich, who were becoming accustomed to a softer life." <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-35"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Religion_and_Normative_Ideology">Religion and Normative Ideology</span></h2>
<p>We are interested here in any systems of thought and behavior that can influence people's actions, which we term a <i>Normative Ideology</i>.  Normative ideologies are thought-systems concerned with the correct behavior of people, governments/leaders, and other groups (and particularly the relationships between these groups).
</p><p>Mainly, this will be a religious or ritual system. As usual, when we mention Religious or Ritual System our focus  is on the 'official cult', defined the same way as in the Rituals section:
</p>
<dl><dd>With the official cult we refer to the set of collective religious practices that are most closely associated with legitimation of the power structure (including elites, if any).</dd></dl>
<p>However, Normative Ideologies are not restricted to religious/ritual systems. They include other thought systems, such as philosophy or anything that prescribes a particular pattern of behaviour. An example is  classical Greek philosophy, such as the works of Plato and Aristotle, who were concerned with correct or moral behaviour and whose thoughts influenced the actual practice of several societies (the empire of Alexander the Great, notably).

</p><p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of equality ♣ absent ♥</b> Due to the rigors of Manichean ethics, followers of this religion were divided into “a small elite of ‘perfect’ or ‘elect’ people”, who had to follow strict commandments, and “the greater community of devout lay-people”, who had to follow different, and less demanding, commandments. “The elect were submitted to five rigorous commandments which confined their lives to the duties of hearing and reading the instructive sermons and scriptures, singing hymns, offering prayers, attending the services and above all the sacramental communal meals, teaching and preaching the gospel of truth to brethren and lay-people, doing missionary work, etc. They were submitted to a strict vegetarian regime and forbidden to drink alcoholic drinks and eat meat, to earn their own livelihood (except for acts of financial business), or practice any sexual activities (Baur, 1831 = 1973, pp. 267-70; Puech, 1949, pp. 89-91).//But living a holy life affected more than the elect’s personal salvation. It made his body, and his digestive system in particular, a miraculous instrument for liberating the light particles of the World Soul that were imprisoned in melons, cucumbers, grapes, water, fruit juice, etc. By eating those fruits the elect set free the light particles from the material massa damnata and let them ascend to the New Paradise of Light in their hymns of praise, their prayers and, as Augustine derisively says, their belches (ructatibus, Baur, 1831 = 1973, p. 287). This happened in their sacramental meals, regularly held whenever fasting was not incumbent. If we call the communal meal of the elect a kind of Eucharist, it is just the opposite of the Christian ceremony. It does not mediate God’s redemption of the believers through Christ’s sacrifice, it affects the redemption of the suffering divine World Soul (also called Jesus patibilis by Faustus) through the redeeming force of holy men (Tardieu, 1981, pp. 111-12). In this way the elect gain a super-human rank, and it is doubtlessly in this function that they are addressed as “gods” (Copt. nnoute, Parth.yazdan, Kephalaia, ed. Polotsky and Bohlig, 1940, pp. 219.34-220.3; Gardner, 1995, p. 227; Zieme, 1975, pp. 28, 29).” <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-64"><a href="#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>♠ Ideological thought equates rulers and commoners ♣ inferred absent ♥</b>  Inferred from documents created in the Kingdom of Kocho, i.e. the polity founded by the Uyghur in the mid-9th centry CE. “Its ideological role was manifested in the Turkic literature from Kocho, which presents numerous examples of the glorification of the Uygur rulers of the steppe. For example, in one text (TM 417 and TM 47 [M 919]), the composer clearly sought to divinize these rulers by comparing one ruler’s death to the “sinking of the Sun God” and his enthronement to “the rising of the Moon God,” so that enthronement itself was likened to a reincarnation of the supreme bodies of Light, resident in the Khan. That these rulers accepted such symbols of their deification is evident from their titles which contained an element proclaiming that they had received their charisma or right to rule from the kun tangri ‘Sun God’ or the ay tangri ‘Moon God’ or both. Church leaders in Kocho had everything to gain from their conscious divinization of the Uygur rulers in the far-off steppe. Deification may not have been the sincerest form of flattery, but it did help to ensure protection of missionary activities within the realm.” <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-65"><a href="#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup></dd>

<p><b>♠ Ideology reinforces prosociality ♣ present ♥</b> "Hearers had to do 'soul-service' by giving alms to the Elect of an amount of one tenth or one seventh of his property, which consisted in the donation of food, clothing, lodging, and other services, such as building residences or courier and transport services. They could also do social work, i.e. to pay for the release of a slave or hostage or to give a relative to the church (as a servant). It was regarded as a pious deed as well to donate money to the copying of the holy scriptures.” <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-66"><a href="#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup>
