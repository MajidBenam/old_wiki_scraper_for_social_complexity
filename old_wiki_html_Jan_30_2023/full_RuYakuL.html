<p><b>♠ RA ♣ Eva Brandl; Dennis Spencer ♥</b> DS contributed the general description.
</p><p><b> ♠ Original name  ♣ Sakha ♥ </b> 'The Yakut, who prefer to call themselves "Sakha," [...] are the farthest-north Turkic people, with a consciousness of having once lived farther south kept alive by legends and confirmed by historical and archaeological research.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Alternative names  ♣  Urangkhai Sakha; 'Yakut'; 'Yakutians' ♥ </b> The term "Yakut" is frequently found in our sources to refer to the Sakha people. However, Sakha is the preferred self-designated term. Therefore, out of respect, we generally prefer “Sakha” instead of "Yakut", except for source titles and direct quotations.'The Yakut, who prefer to call themselves "Sakha," [...] are the farthest-north Turkic people, with a consciousness of having once lived farther south kept alive by legends and confirmed by historical and archaeological research.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Peak Date  ♣ 1850-1900 CE ♥ </b> During the Russian period, Czarist administrative and political control was established over Sakha territory: 'By 1642 the Lena valley was under tribute to the czar; peace was won only after a long siege of a formidable Yakut fortress. By 1700 the fort settlement of Yakutsk (founded 1632) was a bustling Russian administrative, commercial, and religious center and a launching point for further exploration into Kamchatka and Chukotka. Some Yakut moved northeast into territories they had previously not dominated, further assimilating the Evenk and Yukagir. Most Yakut, however, remained in the central meadowlands, sometimes assimilating Russians. Yakut leaders cooperated with Russian commanders and governors, becoming active in trade, fur-tax collection, transport, and the postal system. Fighting among Yakut communities decreased, although horse rustling and occasional anti-Russian violence continued. For example, a Yakut Robin Hood named Manchari led a band that stole from the rich (usually Russians) to give to the poor (usually Yakut) in the nineteenth century. Russian Orthodox priests spread through Yakutia, but their followers were mainly in the major towns. By 1900 a literate Yakut intelligentsia, influenced both by Russian merchants and political exiles, formed a party called the Yakut Union. Yakut revolutionaries such as Oiunskii and Ammosov led the Revolution and civil war in Yakutia, along with Bolsheviks such as the Georgian Ordzhonikidze.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> Given the importance of increasing 'modernization' for the revolutionary developments of the early 20th century, the peak period should be identified with the latter half of the 19th century.

<p><b> ♠ Duration  ♣ 1632-1900 CE ♥ </b> In the early 17th century, Cossack expeditions invaded Sakha territory and exacted tribute from the population: 'By 1620 a report had reached Tobolsk from the Mangaseya Cossacks of the Great (Lena) River and the Lena Yakut. In 1631 they descended by the Viliui River, a tributary of the Lena, to the Lena River and imposed tribute on the adjacent Yakut. In 1632 a party of Cossacks under the command of the Boyar’s son, Shakov, took tribute in sables from a clan of Viliui horse-breeding Yakut. The Viliui River farther up from its mouth was occupied by Tungus only. The northern boundary of the distribution of the Yakut at that time was the mouth of the Viliui. The whole Lena Valley from the mouth of the Viliui River to the south, at a distance of about 500 kilometers (or 710 miles) was occupied by Yakut. In their possession were also all the Lena islands of that region, rich in  pasture lands. There is no definite information as to how far inland they penetrated at that period. We may admit, however, that the Yakut, being horse and cattle breeders, were hardly inclined to move into the dense forests far from the majority of their tribesmen, i.e., far from the Lena Valley. In the beginning of the seventeenth century the Yakut abode on the western banks of the Lena must have been the territory of the two present  uluses  of Yakutsk District, Namskij and Western Kangalassky. There, according to Yakut traditions, was the first place of refuge of their mythical forefather, the “Tatar” Elliei. From there a part of his nearest descendants could also have emigrated over the Lena islands to the eastern banks of the Lena River, where excellent pastures are as abundant as on the western banks.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> During the Russian period, Yakutia came under Czarist political and administrative control: 'By 1642 the Lena valley was under tribute to the czar; peace was won only after a long siege of a formidable Yakut fortress. By 1700 the fort settlement of Yakutsk (founded 1632) was a bustling Russian administrative, commercial, and religious center and a launching point for further exploration into Kamchatka and Chukotka.

</p><p><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ loose ♥ </b> Sakha clan and tribal organization was decentralized: 'Kinship and politics were mixed in the hierarchical council system that guided AQA-USA, AIMAK, and DZHON. Yakut explanations of DZHON in the nineteenth century included concepts like "people," "community," or "tribe," territorially defined. Councils were composed of ranked circles of elders, usually men, whose leaders, TOYONS, were called nobles by Russians. A lineage head was BIS-USA-TOYON; respected warriors and hunters were BATYR. Lineage councils decided major economic issues, interfamily disputes, and questions of blood revenge for violence committed against the group. AIMAK and DZHON councils were infrequent, dealing with issues of security, revenge, alliance, and, before Russian control, war. Through war, slaves were captured for service in the wealthiest TOYON households. Kin-based councils were rare by the nineteenth century and had little influence on twentieth-century politics.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> 'Key kin relations are based on a patrilineage (AQA-USA) that traces membership back nine generations. Within this, children born to a specific mother are distinguished as a group (YE-USA), and may form the basis for different households (KORGON). Historically, more distant kin were recognized on two levels, the AIMAK (or territorial NASLEG), with one to thirty lineages, and the DZHON (or territorial ULUS), composed of several AIMAK. These larger units were united by alliances, including for common defense, alliances, and by economic relations; these links were renewed at councils and festivals.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> 'The Sakha are thought to be an admixture of migrants from the Lake Baikal region with the aborigines of the Lena-probably mostly Evenk (Evenki), who have contributed much to their culture. Other evidence, however, points to a southern ancestry related to the Turkic-speaking tribes of the steppe and the Altai Mountains. The early history of the Sakha is little known, though epic tales date from the 10th century. In the 17th century they had peacefully assimilated with other northern peoples and consisted of 80 independent tribes, subdivided into clans.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>  During the early Russian period, the Czarist administrative structure was superimposed on the Sakha system: 'No less significant changes occurred in the administrative organization of the Yakut country. In the seventeenth century Yakutsk was the center of a great independent country directly subordinate to Moscow, although for some specific questions it was dependent on the governors of Tobolsk. In the time of Peter the Great, Yakutsk entered into the newly organized Siberian Goubernyia (government) and with the division of the Siberian government into provinces was included in Irkutsk Province. In 1775 Irkutsk Province was organized into a government and the Yakut country formed one of the provinces of the new government. In 1783 the government was again reorganized into a vice-royalty composed of four provinces, one of which was Yakutsk Province. In 1797 the vice-royalty was abolished and the government restored. In [Page 225] 1805 under the Emperor Alexander I, the Yakut country was made a separate province dependent upon Irkutsk. In 1852 the Yakut country was given a separate governor. After the revolution in February, 1917, a commissar was appointed by the Provisional Government.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-9"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ vassalage ♥ </b> In the 17th century, the Czar regime started to exact tribute from the Sakha population while gradually integrating Siberia into the general administration: 'By 1620 a report had reached Tobolsk from the Mangaseya Cossacks of the Great (Lena) River and the Lena Yakut. In 1631 they descended by the Viliui River, a tributary of the Lena, to the Lena River and imposed tribute on the adjacent Yakut.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Supra-cultural_relations">Supra-cultural relations</span></h4>
<dl><dd><b> ♠ preceding (quasi)polity  ♣ Sakha Tribes ♥ </b> Before the Russian invasions, the territory was governed by independent Sakha and other tribes: 'Yakut oral histories begin well before first contact with Russians in the seventeenth century. For example, OLONKHO (epics) date at least to the tenth century, a period of interethnic mixing, tensions, and upheaval that may have been a formative period in defining Yakut tribal affiliations. Ethnographic and archaeological data suggest that the ancestors of the Yakut, identified in some theories with the Kuriakon people, lived in an area near Lake Baikal and may have been part of the Uighur state bordering China. By the fourteenth century, Yakut ancestors migrated north, perhaps in small refugee groups, with herds of horses and cattle. After arrival in the Lena valley, they fought and intermarried with the native Evenk and Yukagir nomads. Thus, both peaceful and belligerent relations with northern Siberians, Chinese, Mongols, and Turkic peoples preceded Russian hegemony. When the first parties of Cossacks arrived at the Lena River in the 1620s, Yakut received them with hospitality and wariness. Several skirmishes and revolts followed, led at first by the legendary Yakut hero Tygyn.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-12"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b> ♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ elite migration ♥ </b> Sakha territory came under tribute to Czarist Russia after a series of successful military expeditions: 'By 1620 a report had reached Tobolsk from the Mangaseya Cossacks of the Great (Lena) River and the Lena Yakut.

The Yakut, over 90 percent of whom speak Yakut as their mother tongue, call their language "Sakha-tyla." Their current written language, developed in the 1930s, is a modified Cyrillic script. Before this, they had several written forms, including a Latin script developed in the 1920s and a Cyrillic script introduced by missionaries in the nineteenth century.

In the seventeenth century Yakutsk was the center of a great independent country directly subordinate to Moscow, although for some specific questions it was dependent on the governors of Tobolsk. In the time of Peter the Great, Yakutsk entered into the newly organized Siberian Goubernyia (government) and with the division of the Siberian government into provinces was included in Irkutsk Province. In 1775 Irkutsk Province was organized into a government and the Yakut country formed one of the provinces of the new government. In 1783 the government was again reorganized into a vice-royalty composed of four provinces, one of which was Yakutsk Province. In 1797 the vice-royalty was abolished and the government restored. In [Page 225] 1805 under the Emperor Alexander I, the Yakut country was made a separate province dependent upon Irkutsk. In 1852 the Yakut country was given a separate governor. After the revolution in February, 1917, a commissar was appointed by the Provisional Government.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-38"><a href="#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup> This regional integration was an artefact of Russian imperial rule. The decentralized political organization of the Sakha themselves makes the identification of a reliable and realistic code more difficult.

This region has only 0.01 man to a quadratic mile, or 1 man to 100 square miles. Settlements are confined to the river valleys and the shores of large lakes abounding in fish. The tundra dweller of Siberia seldom settles on the seacoast or on the adjacent islands, as do the American Eskimo. Since off shore the sea is quite shallow the hunting of sea mammals has not been developed; for instance, the ocean between the mouth of the Kolyma River and the Sviatoi Nos to the west is only seven meters deep at a distance of ten or twenty miles from shore. West of the Chukchee are no sea-going peoples and no skin boats. Late in the fall, when snowstorms begin to rage on the tundra, the nomadic natives wander southward to the protection of the forests.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-39"><a href="#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup> During the Russian period, settlers entered the province: 'The influx of Russian peasants (particularly along the Lena Valley on account of the construction of the mail route in 1773) created the right conditions for mutual influence between Russian and Yakut cultural elements. By the end of the 17th and 18th centuries, agriculture began to be practiced by the Yakuts, though at first it was a very slow business and Russian-type houses began to appear. Nevertheless, even in the 19th century the number of Russian settlers was comparatively small.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-40"><a href="#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup> Due to economic hardships the Sakha population may have decreased during that period: 'These circumstances undoubtedly discourage the activity of the Yakut, who no longer endeavors to procure wealth, because it is the likeliest means of making him the object of persecution. Thus property, tranquillity, and population decrease. The princes or chiefs dwelling near towns acquire their luxuries, and oppress their dependant tribes to procure wine and brandy in addition to their koumis: this was never known among them till the year 1785. I will farther add, that in 1784 the district of Gigansk produced 4834 tributary natives; but in 1789 their number amounted only to 1938. Mr. Bonnar, the captain of the district of Zashiversk, told me, that the tributary nations in his circle amounted to only half the number that they were five years ago and that these were very poor indeed.”' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-41"><a href="#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup> Unfortunately, Sauer does not seem to provide figures for the entirety of the province, and neither for individual clans.

Stables, corrals, and haying developed in conjunction with hardy breeds of cattle and short, fat, furry horses. Richer families owned hundreds of horses and cattle; poorer ones raised a few cattle or herded for others. A huge variety of dairy products, including fermented mare's milk, (Russian: KUMYS), was the staple food, with meat for special occasions. The diet was augmented by hunting (bears, elk, squirrels, hare, ferrets, fowl), fishing (salmon, carp, MUSKSUN, MUNDU), and, under Russian influence, agriculture (cereals). Wealthy Yakut hunted on horseback using dogs. The poorest Yakut, those without cattle, relied on fishing with horsehair nets and, in the north, herded reindeer like their Evenk and Yukagir neighbors.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-45"><a href="#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup> When agriculture became more common, the Sakha living near Russian settlements adopted more permanent log houses: 'When living near cities or Russian settlements, the Yakut abandon their earth huts and live in log houses of the Russian type. Fig. 23 illustrates a log house of a rich Yakut elder on the Lena River not far from the City of Yakutsk.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-46"><a href="#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup> Russian settlers established peasant villages: 'Being agriculturists exclusively, they could not follow their calling in the tundras of Turukhansk and they addressed a request to the government that they be transferred to Yakutsk Province. The request was granted. Beginning in 1860 groups of skoptzy were transferred to Yakutsk Province. By 1885, near the cities of Yakutsk, Olekminks, and Viliuisk, and on the Aldan River (near Ust-Maisk) they had ten villages with a population of 1181. This was a strange society which would have become extinct in fifty years had not additional convicted persons been exiled every year and thus replaced the departed. Industrious and with sufficient means, the skoptzy developed agriculture on a great scale and thus contributed to its success in the Yakut country. Early in the summer, they arranged hot beds which were protected during the cold nights; thus they grew the most delicate edible plants as early in the season as is possible only in a warm climate. Between 1885 and 1890 they had under cultivation 13,625 acres of land and were striving to seize the State lands. They employed Yakut laborers and thus the latter learned to cultivate the land.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-47"><a href="#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup> Russian invaders also built fortresses and riverside towns: 'In 1632 the Russian invaders erected a little fortress called Lesnoi Ostroshek, on the eastern bank of the Lena; ten years later they transferred it seventy kilometers to the south, where it became the center of the territory under the name of the City of Yakutsk.

The Dolgans, Yakuts and Evenks had to pay the fur-tax as “natives” and formed “clans” headed by princelings, while the tundra peasants were forced to pay a poll tax, were formed into a “community” and headed by an elder. People living many hundreds of kilometers away from the nearest centers were economically dependent on the merchants who monopolized supplies to the region, bought up all the furs, and cruelly exploited the population.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-49"><a href="#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup> 'These circumstances undoubtedly discourage the activity of the Yakut, who no longer endeavors to procure wealth, because it is the likeliest means of making him the object of persecution.

</p><p>[(5) Russian Imperial Authorities; (4) Russian District Governors; (3) the Russian District Administration;] (2) Councils of Clan Unions and Tribal Units (Dzhon/Ulus) (1) Clan (Aimak/Nasleg) and Lineage (Aqa-Usa) Councils comprised of Elders, Prophets (Sesen) and Leaders (Toyon) or 'Princelings'
</p><p>Until at least the 19th century, lineage councils were the primary administrative bodies: 'Kinship and politics were mixed in the hierarchical council system that guided AQA-USA, AIMAK, and DZHON. Yakut explanations of DZHON in the nineteenth century included concepts like "people," "community," or "tribe," territorially defined. Councils were composed of ranked circles of elders, usually men, whose leaders, TOYONS, were called nobles by Russians. A lineage head was BIS-USA-TOYON; respected warriors and hunters were BATYR. Lineage councils decided major economic issues, interfamily disputes, and questions of blood revenge for violence committed against the group. AIMAK and DZHON councils were infrequent, dealing with issues of security, revenge, alliance, and, before Russian control, war. Through war, slaves were captured for service in the wealthiest TOYON households. Kin-based councils were rare by the nineteenth century and had little influence on twentieth-century politics.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-51"><a href="#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup> 'Key kin relations are based on a patrilineage (AQA-USA) that traces membership back nine generations. Within this, children born to a specific mother are distinguished as a group (YE-USA), and may form the basis for different households (KORGON). Historically, more distant kin were recognized on two levels, the AIMAK (or territorial NASLEG), with one to thirty lineages, and the DZHON (or territorial ULUS), composed of several AIMAK. These larger units were united by alliances, including for common defense, alliances, and by economic relations; these links were renewed at councils and festivals.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-52"><a href="#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup> 'Prophets' and other elders dominated most councils: 'According to tradition, the seseny played no minor role in assemblies in the past.  The word sesen comes from the same root as the verb sesenibin - I advise, I think, I predict. Legend portrayes the seseny as  white-haired, honored, experienced elders.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-53"><a href="#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup> 'This dignity was neither elective nor hereditary, but not every old man was considered to be a sesen.  For  this he had to have a special gift of prophecy - in other words: an acknowledged intellect, experience, and knowledge.  In difficult moments the heroes of olongo frequently turn to such advice-giving, honored, light-eyed Old Men-Talkers.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-54"><a href="#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup> 'In the past we did not decide anything without sesen.  (Namsk Ulus, 1888).  I will note that in this testimony sesen is used in the sense of sorcerer.  The sesen decided disputed questions on the basis of custom, and gave advice when the clan was undergoing hard times.  At ysyakh, before the games and contests  began, the sesen of each clan or clan union would look over their own wrestlers; and they would remove those who were not good enough, who had recently sinned with a woman, who did not restrain themselves sufficiently in eating and drinking, so that they would not bring  shame to their own people. They found all this out by feeling the body of the wrestlers, and by looking into their eyes and face. (Namsk Ulus, 1891).  In the Bayagantaysk Ulus, when I asked who had named the rivers, hills, and other natural features, they answered: It must be the sesen - the old, ancient men, who knew everything!  (Bayagantaysk Ulus, 1885).' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-55"><a href="#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup> Sesens were often from the toen class: 'Since within the clan many sesen were at the same time toen, i.e., the representatives of separate groups, they wielded enormous influencein clan councils. Usually in legends they  are simply called old men - ogonior.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-56"><a href="#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup> Clan unions and tribal units also held council: 'They wielded less importance in councils of clan unions: there the first place was held by the heads of the clans, bis' usa toeno.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-57"><a href="#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup> The Russian administration reinforced kin-based hierarchies and superimposed a supratribal structure onto the Sakha system: 'The system of tsarist administration was no different here from what existed in any other part of Northern Siberia. The Dolgans, Yakuts and Evenks had to pay the fur-tax as “natives” and formed “clans” headed by princelings, while the tundra peasants were forced to pay a poll tax, were formed into a “community” and headed by an elder. People living many hundreds of kilometers away from the nearest centers were economically dependent on the merchants who monopolized supplies to the region, bought up all the furs, and cruelly exploited the population.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-58"><a href="#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup> 'If they have claims against their subordinate clansmen, the clan-chiefs bring complaints: 1.  The headman--to the nasleg princelings and clan elders.  If unsatisfied with their decision, or in case of noncompliance, they may complain to the authorities. 2.  The princelings--first, to the clan elders in their jurisdiction, and in the case of noncompliance or dissatisfaction with their decision, to the ulus headmen, and finally, to the authorities. 3.  The clansmen among themselves--to the clan elders and nasleg princelings, and in the case of noncompliance to the ulus headman; and finally to the authorities.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-59"><a href="#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup> Sakha leaders cooperated with Russian imperial administrators, collecting taxes for them and contributing to the establishment of the emerging postal system in Siberia: 'Most Yakut, however, remained in the central meadowlands, sometimes assimilating Russians. Yakut leaders cooperated with Russian commanders and governors, becoming active in trade, fur-tax collection, transport, and the postal system. Fighting among Yakut communities decreased, although horse rustling and occasional anti-Russian violence continued.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-60"><a href="#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup>

[...] In the nineteenth century a few Yakut leaders financed the building of Russian Orthodox churches, and many Yakut declared themselves Christian, but this did not mean that they saw Christianity and shamanism as mutually exclusive. The Yakut also believed in the spiritual power of blacksmiths.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-61"><a href="#cite_note-61">[61]</a></sup> 'Nevertheless, the outward conditions of life have hardly changed after the Russian conquest. There is always the same uncertainty of existence; the unsatisfactory conditions for men as well as for animals continue to exist. The sacrificial priests still everywhere and always hold position and duties of priests, physicians, and fortune-tellers (prophets).' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-62"><a href="#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup> 'In the Yakut district all Yakuts with rare exceptions have been baptized according to the ‘ancient faith’ [RCH:  i.e. , Christianity] rite, or were born from parents of that faith. Yet one can hardly be sure that a Yakut, professing the ancient faith, has given up his shamanist creed, or that he does not have recourse to the latter. I have personally known two shamans, one of them in the Yakutsk district, the other on the Kytach island on the mouth of the Lena, who were both known as followers of the ‘ancient faith.’' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-63"><a href="#cite_note-63">[63]</a></sup> There where black and white shamans: 'Supernatural power was attributed to blacksmiths, since their art was considered a divine gift. The old Sakha religion had many supernatural spirits, good and evil. Black shamans dealt with evil spirits and could be benevolent or harmful; white shamans were concerned with spiritual intercession for human beings. Two major religious festivals were celebrated with ritual use of koumiss (fermented mare’s milk), one in spring for good spirits and one in fall accompanied by blood sacrifices of livestock for evil spirits.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-64"><a href="#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup> Shamans officiated at seasonal festivals: 'The most important festival among the Yakut is connected with the preparation and use of kumiss, and is called  ysyax,  or kumiss festival. It has both a social and a religious significance. During the summer, in olden times, every rich man arranged a kumiss festival, at which all members of the clan assembled and were entertained. Other people, and frequently whole clans, were invited; and during the festival, defensive and offensive leagues were concluded. Every such festival commenced with sacrifices, and was accompanied with songs, dances, games, horse and foot races, and other contests.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-65"><a href="#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup> 'The first night of the festival is in honor of Big-Lord ( Ulu-Toyon ) and the evil spirits of the upper world subordinate to him. The second night is in honor of  Axsan Duolai  and his subordinates, the evil spirits of the lower world. To all of these evil spirits, in addition to the libations of kumiss made to the benevolent deities, blood sacrifices of cattle and horses are also made. This ceremony, according to Trostchansky,  is superintended by nine male and nine female shamans.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-66"><a href="#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup> Shamans were compensated for their services, but did not receive sufficient payments for their livelihood: 'I at least never heard anything about a wealthy shaman; on the contrary, the shaman often gets no more than 5 kopeks for healing a sick eye. And how little is this sum worth north of Yakutsk! Some Yakuts refused to accept a twenty kopeks coin for a hazel-hen I wanted to buy, saying that they could not manage to use the money; if it had an eye, they would have used it as a button; but as there was no such, I was to take it back. The smallest unit for them is the ruble.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-67"><a href="#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup> Contact with Russian Orthodox priests was irregular: 'The aborigines seldom have an opportunity to see a priest of the ancient faith. In view of the enormous extension of the parishes, of the scattered settlements, and of the extraordinary difficulties in securing communications, he is hardly in a position to see each member of his faith once a year; and if he visits him in one of the settling-places he may not stay longer than two or three days because he must be through with his travel as long as the paths and roads are practicable. One may safely estimate that eight [probably eighty rather than eight, given the context: comment by RA] per cent of the aborigines population has never seen a Christian church. His eminency, the former Yakut bishop Dionysius even told me that sometimes priests had died without having communicated, leaving a written confession of sins.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-68"><a href="#cite_note-68">[68]</a></sup> Accordingly, the material is coded for Sakha rather than Orthodox institutions.

Khudiakov has a legend about Khaptagay-batyr and his son Khokhoe-batyr, and their three khosun: Sappy, Yngkabyl, and Batagyyan, who roamed about in the seventeen forties, during the time of Pavlutskii, in the north of the Yakutsk Oblast.

Sometimes the clan would choose such people out of their own number and deliberately send them out on a searching party.

Black shamans dealt with evil spirits and could be benevolent or harmful; white shamans were concerned with spiritual intercession for human beings. Two major religious festivals were celebrated with ritual use of koumiss (fermented mare’s milk), one in spring for good spirits and one in fall accompanied by blood sacrifices of livestock for evil spirits.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-87"><a href="#cite_note-87">[87]</a></sup> Shamans officiated at seasonal festivals: 'The most important festival among the Yakut is connected with the preparation and use of kumiss, and is called  ysyax,  or kumiss festival. It has both a social and a religious significance. During the summer, in olden times, every rich man arranged a kumiss festival, at which all members of the clan assembled and were entertained. Other people, and frequently whole clans, were invited; and during the festival, defensive and offensive leagues were concluded. Every such festival commenced with sacrifices, and was accompanied with songs, dances, games, horse and foot races, and other contests.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-88"><a href="#cite_note-88">[88]</a></sup> 'The first night of the festival is in honor of Big-Lord ( Ulu-Toyon ) and the evil spirits of the upper world subordinate to him. The second night is in honor of  Axsan Duolai  and his subordinates, the evil spirits of the lower world. To all of these evil spirits, in addition to the libations of kumiss made to the benevolent deities, blood sacrifices of cattle and horses are also made. This ceremony, according to Trostchansky,  is superintended by nine male and nine female shamans.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-89"><a href="#cite_note-89">[89]</a></sup> Shamans were compensated for their services, but did not receive sufficient payments for their livelihood: 'I at least never heard anything about a wealthy shaman; on the contrary, the shaman often gets no more than 5 kopeks for healing a sick eye. And how little is this sum worth north of Yakutsk! Some Yakuts refused to accept a twenty kopeks coin for a hazel-hen I wanted to buy, saying that they could not manage to use the money; if it had an eye, they would have used it as a button; but as there was no such, I was to take it back. The smallest unit for them is the ruble.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-90"><a href="#cite_note-90">[90]</a></sup> Contact with Russian Orthodox priests was irregular: 'The aborigines seldom have an opportunity to see a priest of the ancient faith. In view of the enormous extension of the parishes, of the scattered settlements, and of the extraordinary difficulties in securing communications, he is hardly in a position to see each member of his faith once a year; and if he visits him in one of the settling-places he may not stay longer than two or three days because he must be through with his travel as long as the paths and roads are practicable. One may safely estimate that eight [probably eighty rather than eight, given the context: comment by RA] per cent of the aborigines population has never seen a Christian church. His eminency, the former Yakut bishop Dionysius even told me that sometimes priests had died without having communicated, leaving a written confession of sins.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-91"><a href="#cite_note-91">[91]</a></sup> Accordingly, the material is coded for Sakha rather than Orthodox institutions.

<p><b> ♠ Full-time bureaucrats ♣ inferred absent ♥ </b> The early invaders imposed tribute on the Sakha population after successful military expeditions: 'By 1620 a report had reached Tobolsk from the Mangaseya Cossacks of the Great (Lena) River and the Lena Yakut. In 1631 they descended by the Viliui River, a tributary of the Lena, to the Lena River and imposed tribute on the adjacent Yakut. In 1632 a party of Cossacks under the command of the Boyar’s son, Shakov, took tribute in sables from a clan of Viliui horse-breeding Yakut. The Viliui River farther up from its mouth was occupied by Tungus only. The northern boundary of the distribution of the Yakut at that time was the mouth of the Viliui. The whole Lena Valley from the mouth of the Viliui River to the south, at a distance of about 500 kilometers (or 710 miles) was occupied by Yakut. In their possession were also all the Lena islands of that region, rich in  pasture lands. There is no definite information as to how far inland they penetrated at that period. We may admit, however, that the Yakut, being horse and cattle breeders, were hardly inclined to move into the dense forests far from the majority of their tribesmen, i.e., far from the Lena Valley. In the beginning of the seventeenth century the Yakut abode on the western banks of the Lena must have been the territory of the two present  uluses  of Yakutsk District, Namskij and Western Kangalassky. There, according to Yakut traditions, was the first place of refuge of their mythical forefather, the “Tatar” Elliei. From there a part of his nearest descendants could also have emigrated over the Lena islands to the eastern banks of the Lena River, where excellent pastures are as abundant as on the western banks.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-92"><a href="#cite_note-92">[92]</a></sup> 'We have previously noted (see p. 64) that the Yakut were subjugated by two different Cossack parties from Mangasey aand Yeniseisk. The Olekminsk fortress on the Lena River was erected in 1630 when only Tungus lived in the region. In 1637 a Cossack party, under the command of Busa, collected tribute in furs from the Yakut of the Yana River.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-93"><a href="#cite_note-93">[93]</a></sup> The czarist administration imposed taxes and established an administrative infrastructure: 'The system of tsarist administration was no different here from what existed in any other part of Northern Siberia. The Dolgans, Yakuts and Evenks had to pay the fur-tax as “natives” and formed “clans” headed by princelings, while the tundra peasants were forced to pay a poll tax, were formed into a “community” and headed by an elder. People living many hundreds of kilometers away from the nearest centers were economically dependent on the merchants who monopolized supplies to the region, bought up all the furs, and cruelly exploited the population.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-94"><a href="#cite_note-94">[94]</a></sup> 'The committee of Cherkashennikov which worked in the Yakutsk Oblast was only a branch of this All-Siberian commission. On December 14, 1766, an ukaz was issued which called for deputies from all of Russia to form a committee for establishing a better administration, discussing various problems of internal policy, and, incidentally, to establish a new code for the natives of Siberia. The Yakut, who were listed as nomads, were excluded from the list of electors, but they sent their deputy anyway and he was allowed to join the committee by a special order of the Empress.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-95"><a href="#cite_note-95">[95]</a></sup> 'The overall development of commodity relationships helped to speed up the development of agriculture and here and there ploughing was enforced by the administration.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-96"><a href="#cite_note-96">[96]</a></sup> 'No less significant changes occurred in the administrative organization of the Yakut country. In the seventeenth century Yakutsk was the center of a great independent country directly subordinate to Moscow, although for some specific questions it was dependent on the governors of Tobolsk. In the time of Peter the Great, Yakutsk entered into the newly organized Siberian Goubernyia (government) and with the division of the Siberian government into provinces was included in Irkutsk Province. In 1775 Irkutsk Province was organized into a government and the Yakut country formed one of the provinces of the new government. In 1783 the government was again reorganized into a vice-royalty composed of four provinces, one of which was Yakutsk Province. In 1797 the vice-royalty was abolished and the government restored. In [Page 225] 1805 under the Emperor Alexander I, the Yakut country was made a separate province dependent upon Irkutsk. In 1852 the Yakut country was given a separate governor. After the revolution in February, 1917, a commissar was appointed by the Provisional Government.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-97"><a href="#cite_note-97">[97]</a></sup> Sieroszewski reports corruption and exploitation of the Sakha population by administrators: 'The government undertook to regulate the distribution of Yakut land, [Page 764] partly to cease the disorders which arose as a result of this a nd partly to as sure and regulate the taking of yassak, which was being gathered with unbelievable arbitrariness and accompanied by terrible ill use, was stolen, substituted for, and hidden, and they stole from the Great Tsars by putting far too little in the treasury and by undervaluing the yassak greatly, and they impoverished the yassak-paying people and robbed the taxes and injured them.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-98"><a href="#cite_note-98">[98]</a></sup> In addition to Russian officials, land-holding toyons also doubled as officials in their districts: 'The population was also divided into three or four classes: the toyon households belonged to the first class, and received a first-class plot, the middle households were usually assigned to the second class and the poorer people to the third and fourth classes, each receiving the corresponding clan plot. Thus, the system itself gave the toyons plots of land which were three or four times larger than those of the poorer people. It is true that in return for this the toyons had somewhat greater obligations, but the difference in their extent was extremely small. However, this inequality was by no means the only thing. The toyons actually possessed much more land, having seized it in a variety of different ways. For example, they had several plots, rather than just one, by registering them in the names of their children, workers and so on. It was also the custom to give officials (who were more often than not themselves toyons) additional plots of land, so-called [...] (from the Russian word “ukaz” [edict]), for which, incidentally, there was no payment. The influential toyons also obtained extra plots called ugayy (or kharyy).  Furthermore, the toyons frequently enjoyed the right of possessing larger plots, sometimes through inheritance, cleared from the forest or formed at the site of a drained lake. The leasing of land was also common.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-99"><a href="#cite_note-99">[99]</a></sup>

Sakhas accused of a crime were occasionally held there: 'In the Yakut settlements there are no special places set up for the maintenance of prisoners;  consequently, they are kept until the final decision of their case in the houses where the trial is taking place. For thievery of any kind and similar big  crimes, they are kept with wooden blocks on their legs, or with handcuffs on their arms, or, for petty misdemeanors, without anything special.  if the trial takes place in town, the accused is kept in the town council building.  The reasons for which the Sakha are arrested and imprisoned are as follows: 1) a discovered crime; 2) suspicion of any crime prior to the final investigation and decision of the case; 3) disobedience and insubordination to the clan-chiefs; 4) nonpayment of taxes and duties in the allotted time, and also just and proved debts to private individuals; 5) drunkenness, uproarious behavior, and playing with dice; and , finally, 6) according to the decision of the clan-chiefs or the authorities, as a punishment for any crime.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-102"><a href="#cite_note-102">[102]</a></sup>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Law">Law</span></h3>
<p><b> ♠ Formal legal code ♣ absent: 1632-1889 CE; present: 1890-1900 CE ♥ </b> During the Russian period, some Russian legal concepts were adopted by the Sakha: 'N. P. Pripuzov gathered his material among the Yakuts living in the Yakutsk district, i. e., in the midst of that part of the Yakut tribe among whom we may rightly expect to encounter some traces of the action of Russian customary and legislative norms upon the customary law of the Yakuts. All the more interest attaches to the norms of the Yakut customary law noted by the compiler, which, despite the long association of the Yakuts with the Russians, have survived as a valuable vestige of the ancient familial-clan foundations. But no less interest attaches to certain juridical customs, communicated by the compiler, which have been worked out by the Yakuts under the obvious influence of the Russians; the structure of Yakut life is changing its aspect; the new conditions of life which are coming to birth demand new norms for their satisfaction. The latter are sometimes borrowed from Russian neighbors, come into contradiction with the bases of the ancient life and undergo certain changes under the influence of the archaic views on legal relations.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-103"><a href="#cite_note-103">[103]</a></sup> But Sakha trials were based on prior agreements between the contending parties rather than codified law: 'Agreements and contracts, both written and oral, are taken as a basis for all trials and settlements; therefore, if there is no quarrel about the contents of an agreement, the decision is quick, but if anyone refuses to abide by an agreement, and it was oral, his opponent may prove it with witnesses, and, if there are no witnesses, the quarrel is decided by an oath.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-104"><a href="#cite_note-104">[104]</a></sup> '“As a nation they are unsocial, litigious, and vindictive. An injury received by one of them is very rarely forgotten, and, if he cannot revenge it himself, he will leave the feud to his son. Their passion for litigation is excessive: they will frequently undertake difficult and expensive journeys, in a cause where perhaps the matter in dispute is not of the value of a rouble. Their unsocial dispo-sition, which leads them to prefer settling by single families at a distance from each other, is strikingly contrasted with the cheerful and ready hospitality which they show to strangers. They very seldom settle in communities, and it is only along the route from Jakuzk to the Aldan, where the country is more populous, that such settlements are now and then to be met with; but beyond the Werchojansk chain, the solitary  jurti  are often hundreds of wersts apart, so that the nearest neighbours may not see each other for years. Such distances are far greater than can be required on account of pasture, and are rather to be ascribed to the disposition which leads them to seek solitude, and to avoid all social intercourse.”' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-105"><a href="#cite_note-105">[105]</a></sup> Criminal cases were transferred to courts applying Russian law only after 1889: 'Nevertheless until very r ecently and even criminal cases such as beatings, personal injury, and thefts, even for a considerable amount, as long as a house was not broken into, were judged by the clan administration.  Only from the year 1889, when an order came out to proceed against the trible authorities  if they did not communicate such matters, have thefts begun to be referred to the Russian courts and judged according to Russian laws. For theft the Yakut usually punished wealthy people by a fine which was two or three times the value of the stolen article, depending on the circumstances. For beatings and personal injuries they sentenced the guilty party to support the injured party during his disablement or to pay him a lump sum.  Now the guilty are put in prison, and to the great horror of their neighbors they usually leave out and out scoundrels.  Such crimes as the violation of women, the breaking of agreements, fraud, and forgery were apparently unknown to the Yakut and went unpunished. But the violation of the wedding agreement was provided for by the kalym. At the present time most of the cases and statements of claim which come before the clan administrations concern the violation of boundary lines and various disputed lands.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-106"><a href="#cite_note-106">[106]</a></sup> Clerical courts occasionally prosecuted polygamy prior to that date: 'Such polygamy, which is tolerated for the above reasons, and which has existed since ancient times and does not do any harm, had not become bad in the judgement of the Yakut, and no regulations for the abolition of this custom have been set up by the Yakut.  However, since the Yakut adopted the Christian faith, and as they have become enlightened by strict surveillance and sometimes by indulgent reprimands from the eparchial priests, it has been gradually dying out, but nevertheless denunciations on this subject are made concerning people who have lawfully wedded wives but keep the others, and people who had several wives before conversion and married one of them in church without leaving the others, who were left at home with their children;  in the case of such a denunciation the local authorities, on the grounds of the repugnance of the Christian religion for this custom, pressed formal charges, and the guilty parties were handed over to the clerical court as fornicators, and the cases were decided according to general state laws, which constituted and still constitute and extreme burden for the Yakut.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-107"><a href="#cite_note-107">[107]</a></sup> Sieroszewski's material on punishment seems to refer to Yakut assemblies rather than Russian courts: 'In 1867, according to official data, 1870 cases were judged in the upravas in the vicinity of Yakutsk:  out of the total, 1855 concerned land disputes; in the Vilyuysk Okrug, out of 3786 cases, more than half had to do with land. Besides levying fines the Yakut also punish a guilty party by reprimanding him publicly,  before the assembly, by sending him on some job, or putting him into solitary confinement.  The latter is apparently a Russian innovation.  Punishment with birch-rods was quite unknown to the Yakut in the past. Even now they have recourse to this very rarely and with great distaste.  In the north they did not even know  what this was like, and once, in the Kolymsk Ulus, when the assembly did not known what to do with one of its disobedient members and decided, on the advice of some Yakut who had come from the south, to flog him, they turned to me with questions: where should we beat him?, and do we have to lay him down and undress him or is that not permitted? (Kolymsk Ulus, Undzha, 1883).  Usually the influence of the commune is quite sufficient to exert necessary compulsion.  In the south, where the  ties of the commune have weakened, we find disobedient people whose cattle are taken away as a punishment,  or who are forced to obey.  Many decisions of the clan assemblies astonished me by their strangeness, but once I looked closer into their life and made thorough inquiries into their motives I always found at the bottom a deep respect for the individual and a striving toward equality.

At the present time most of the cases and statements of claim which come before the clan administrations concern the violation of boundary lines and various disputed lands.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-116"><a href="#cite_note-116">[116]</a></sup> Sieroszewski's material on punishment seems to refer to Yakut assemblies rather than Russian courts: 'In 1867, according to official data, 1870 cases were judged in the upravas in the vicinity of Yakutsk:  out of the total, 1855 concerned land disputes; in the Vilyuysk Okrug, out of 3786 cases, more than half had to do with land. Besides levying fines the Yakut also punish a guilty party by reprimanding him publicly,  before the assembly, by sending him on some job, or putting him into solitary confinement.  The latter is apparently a Russian innovation.  Punishment with birch-rods was quite unknown to the Yakut in the past. Even now they have recourse to this very rarely and with great distaste.  In the north they did not even know  what this was like, and once, in the Kolymsk Ulus, when the assembly did not known what to do with one of its disobedient members and decided, on the advice of some Yakut who had come from the south, to flog him, they turned to me with questions: where should we beat him?, and do we have to lay him down and undress him or is that not permitted? (Kolymsk Ulus, Undzha, 1883).  Usually the influence of the commune is quite sufficient to exert necessary compulsion.  In the south, where the  ties of the commune have weakened, we find disobedient people whose cattle are taken away as a punishment,  or who are forced to obey.  Many decisions of the clan assemblies astonished me by their strangeness, but once I looked closer into their life and made thorough inquiries into their motives I always found at the bottom a deep respect for the individual and a striving toward equality.  Naturally I say nothing about those decisions which are demonstrably incorrect, and not in accord with custom and the conscience of the people, but which they have been forced to make because of the economic pressure of unscrupulous rich people or because of administrative arbitrariness.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-117"><a href="#cite_note-117">[117]</a></sup> Clerical courts occasionally prosecuted polygamy prior to that date: 'Such polygamy, which is tolerated for the above reasons, and which has existed since ancient times and does not do any harm, had not become bad in the judgement of the Yakut, and no regulations for the abolition of this custom have been set up by the Yakut.  However, since the Yakut adopted the Christian faith, and as they have become enlightened by strict surveillance and sometimes by indulgent reprimands from the eparchial priests, it has been gradually dying out, but nevertheless denunciations on this subject are made concerning people who have lawfully wedded wives but keep the others, and people who had several wives before conversion and married one of them in church without leaving the others, who were left at home with their children;  in the case of such a denunciation the local authorities, on the grounds of the repugnance of the Christian religion for this custom, pressed formal charges, and the guilty parties were handed over to the clerical court as fornicators, and the cases were decided according to general state laws, which constituted and still constitute and extreme burden for the Yakut.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-118"><a href="#cite_note-118">[118]</a></sup>

The yurts were oblong huts with slanted earth walls, low ceilings, sod roofs and dirt floors. Most had an adjoining room for cattle. They had substantial hearths, and fur-covered benches lining the walls demarcated sleeping arrangements according to social protocol. Yurts faced east, toward benevolent deities. In summer families moved to larger encampments with their animals. The most ancient summer homes, URASY, were elegant birch-bark conical tents. Some could hold one hundred people. Their ceilings soared at the center point, above a circular hearth. Around the sides were wide benches placed in compartments that served as ranked seating and sleeping areas. Every pole or eave was carved with symbolic designs of animals, fertility, and lineage identities.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-127"><a href="#cite_note-127">[127]</a></sup> Russian and Sakha farmers constructed grain warehouses, but the Sakha were generally unfamiliar with effective methods of grain preservation: 'The seeds always cost more than three rubles.  Even in harvest years, when in winter one can buy four for one ruble eighty kopecks a pood, a pood of seeds costs two rubles.  This i s due to the fact that in the first place, they use selected grain for seeds, so that not every homeowner is willing to sow with his own seeds, and secondly, because most Yakut sow less grain than they use. Rich Yakut naturally take advantage of this, and encouraged by the spring season of bad roads and the constant pecuniary embarrassment of the Yakut they loan seeds and make profits of one hundred percent on them.  I must remark that in general the Yakut still have not learned how to store grain.  Their grain warehouses and , even the public warehouses, are in almost all cases so poorly constructed that grain which has lain there for two or three years is no longer good f or seeds.  Sometimes it becomes so moldy that it is hard to eat flour prepared from it.  This inability to keep grain in storage supports the custom of handing out public seeds as a loan, pood for pood, to well-to-do clan heads, even in harvest years. Because of this many warehouses are found to be empty in poor crop years, and this factor is just about the strongest hindrance to the success of agriculture.  At such times there are exceedingly few seeds in the okrug.  A poor crop of grain usually concides with a small harvest of grass, and therefore a lack of milk.  The grain is consumed.  It is remarkable that the raising of grain has been strengthened even in the more northern regions, but only where there are large permanent stores of seeds, either in the form of Russian agricultural settlements or Yakut homesteads operating on a large scale.  There are very few Yakut carrying on the raising of grain on a large scale for commercial purposes. Even such rich Yakut as, for example, Syrom yatnikov, of the Bayagantaysk Ulus sowed only for themselves, something like one desiatin per household; there were four household in all.  [...]  In the Olekminsk Okrug I saw splendid farmsteads, well cultivated, with large areas sowed with the same kind of grain, with judicious household arrangeme nts, warehouses, threshing barns, and flour mills.

Roads suitable for wheeled transport are rare. They extend only 1036 kilometers: from Yakutsk to Viliuisk (600 km.) and from Viliuisk to Suntar (436 km.). I myself had the opportunity to use a wheeled cart when traveling from Yakutsk about sixty miles to the east to the Churupcha settlement.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-129"><a href="#cite_note-129">[129]</a></sup> Russians and Sakha relied on sledges and waterways where roads were absent or not passable: 'All the other roads are swampy and in summer were passable only on horseback; even this means of transportation is very difficult, particularly in the northern districts. In winter sledges are everywhere drawn by horses; in the northern districts reindeer and dogs are also used. Many Tungus, Lamut, and Yukaghir use the reindeer for riding, particularly in the mountainous districts between the great rivers. In summer small steamers ply the Lena and Viliui rivers. On the Yana, Indighirka, and Kolyma rivers and their tributaries large boats are used for carrying freight as well as for passengers. During the winter freight carried on pack-horses or by reindeer sledges from the shores of the Okhotsk Sea (Okhotsk, Yamsk, Ayan or Ola) over the mountains to the upper course of the Kolyma River, is floated down on pontoon-like rafts consisting of two large boats covered with a bridge. Such rafts are provided with a rudder and are propelled with long poles. As they cannot be poled up the river they are sold to the inhabitants of Nishne Kolymsk, who make boats of different sizes from them. Recently I learned that a steamer coming through Bering Strait now visits Nishne Kolymsk every summer, bringing flour and other commodities for sale or exchange for furs.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-130"><a href="#cite_note-130">[130]</a></sup> 'Of the large wooden objects used, the Yakut boat, sleigh, and wagon carry so many traces of various later influences in their shape and workmanship that it is extremely difficult to determine their original forms and trace the extent of each outside influence.  All these are recent Yakut acquisitions. In many places the wagon is unknown to the present day.  It was only with difficulty that I could explain the idea of the wheel to the Kolymsk Yakut, and they could not discern any difference in transportation along the ground between a wagon and a sleigh, on which they carry loads even in summer. Even sleighs are little used by the Yakut in these remote northern regions, and then only with dogs and reindeer. The use of the yoke and the shaft-bow is unknown to the Yakut, and when they infrequently have to harness horses for some traveling government officials, they harness them to those  same reindeer narty - using the same reindeer straps which are thrown over the saddle. Then the coachman gets on this horse, or on the one in front of it.  It is understandable that both the horse and those riding in the sleigh become extremely fatigued from the constant jerking and shaking.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-131"><a href="#cite_note-131">[131]</a></sup> The use of harness dogs was also common: 'In West Siberia the harness is very strange: the breech-band is put on the body in front of the breast bone, and a belt issuing from the breech-band is placed between the legs of the animal, so that it pulls with its pelvis.  The east-siberian harness is of the breast variety: the breechband is placed on the breast  of the dog and belts from it cover the sides of the animal towards the alik (the hauling belt which takes the place of theconnecting pole).  On the road each dog carries between 2 and 2 1/2 pouds.  The full team consists of twelve dogs with the thirteenth acting as leader.  In travel the dogs are fed with raw, frozen and dried fish. At home special dog food is made for them.  No matter how hungry they may be the Yakut dogs will not eat bread: on smelling it they will move away as if it were a stone.  At the same time they eat cowberry, golubitsu, and currant, picking them directly from the bushes,--and some varieties of grass and roots.  However, it is not difficult to get them used to eating bread by mixing flour in small quantities with the fish soup.  Between 50 and 70 herrings are to be provided for a harness team of 12 dogs, the number depending on how well-fed the animals are. In autumn, before the beginning of the travel, the Yakuts always train and put into shape th n the beginning, the dogs are given a rest every 5 viersts.  The young dogs are trained by harnessing them up with the experienced ones: the most intelligent and best trained dog must be selected as leader.  Trips of several thousand viersts  can be made with good dogs but travelling in such cases is not fast.  Using twelve dogs with a burden of 20 pouds one may in spring, travelling over a short distance and on a compact, smooth road--cover between 150 and 200 viersts a day.  The usual ride does not exceed 60-70 viersts, and on a bad road the travelled distance does not exceed 30 or 40 viersts a day.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-132"><a href="#cite_note-132">[132]</a></sup></dd>

Once a religious celebration led by a shaman, the ceremony has been adapted since World War I into a secular commemoration of Yakut traditions. Practiced in villages and towns, it features opening prayers (ALGYS) and libations of KUMYS to the earth. Although some Yakut debate its "authenticity," the festival still includes feasting, horse racing, wrestling, and all-night line dancing to improvised chants. It lasts three joyous days in Suntar, where it is especially famed. Wedding rituals, pared down from previous eras, center around memorial hitching posts (SERQE), carved for the occasion, with couples honored by prayers, special food, and dancing. New rituals marking wedding anniversaries and graduations at all educational levels include the placement of SERQE, on which names of those honored are carved. But traditional rituals of birth, supplicating the goddess of fertility, Aiyycyt, have become less popular, with some Yakut women even mocking the restrictions that were once associated with beliefs about female impurity. Russian Orthodox holidays are rarely celebrated.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-140"><a href="#cite_note-140">[140]</a></sup> The use of calenders as described by Jochelson more closely resembles mnemonic devices than written records: 'After becoming Christians the Yakut no longer followed this method of reckoning time, but oriented themselves by the Christian holidays, for instance:  kirisiäniye  (Russian,  krestcheniye ), baptism, January sixth;  Kiristiäp  (Russian,  Kristov ). Easter:  Orosuospa  (Russian  Rozhdestvo ), Christmas;  bul[unknown]astar  (Russian,  Vlasii ), or  ynax tañarata  (cow’s holiday), February eleventh. Russians regard Saint Vlasii as the protector of domestic cattle and among the Yakut this saint replaced the female deity, Ayisit, of their old mythology. Among the Yakut are experienced individuals who know the number of days between holidays since it is easier to deal with immovable feasts. For movable festivals, they must often consult their priest. On the wall of every Yakut dwelling is a calendar, usually consisting of a small board with holes corresponding to the number of days in the year.  The immovable feasts are marked by crosses over the holes. A wooden peg is placed in the hole to indicate the current date, thus showing whether it is an ordinary day or a holiday. Fig. 1 shows a circular calendar; the inner circle has seven perforations, corresponding to the seven days of the week. A peg is shown in the hole for Sunday, over which there is a cross. The outer ring has thirty holes. When the month has thirty-one days, the peg is kept in the last hole for two days. If the month has twenty-nine or twenty-eight days, the peg must be transferred to the first day of the next month.

<dd><b> ♠ Calendar ♣ absent ♥ </b> The Sakha initially used a nonwritten lunar calender: 'The ancient Yakut divided the year into lunar months ( yi-syl ). According to Jonov, one year ( tögürüksyl ) in our calendar was regarded as two years: spring and summer were counted as one year and fall and winter as another. Consequently, the time count in old Yakut traditions is much confused. For example, after two years in our count had passed, the Yakut may have said that four years had elapsed. The month was divided into two sections. The first half, until full moon, was called “the new” ( sañata ); the second half, following the full moon, “the old” ( ärgätä ). The days in the first half of the month are enumerated regularly from one to fifteen; in the second half, they are counted in reverse order, from fifteen to one. Thus, there are two fifteenth days in the month, one at the end of the first half and another at the beginning of the second half. Some moments in the phases of the moon are poetically defined; for instance, of the first day of the first half of the month, the Yakut say:  kys jaxtar kylamanbin kurduk kylbayan taxs[unknown]yta,  it glistened like the eyelash of a young girl; of the twenty-eighth day (the Yakut second day of the second half of the month) they say:  xotun jaxtar ytarhatyn iämähin saha ärgi[unknown]ciyä baranyta,  it ends like the size of a woman’s earring.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-160"><a href="#cite_note-160">[160]</a></sup> The use of calenders by Christian Sakha resembles mnemonic devices more closely than written documents: 'After becoming Christians the Yakut no longer followed this method of reckoning time, but oriented themselves by the Christian holidays, for instance:  kirisiäniye  (Russian,  krestcheniye ), baptism, January sixth;  Kiristiäp  (Russian,  Kristov ). Easter:  Orosuospa  (Russian  Rozhdestvo ), Christmas;  bul[unknown]astar  (Russian,  Vlasii ), or  ynax tañarata  (cow’s holiday), February eleventh. Russians regard Saint Vlasii as the protector of domestic cattle and among the Yakut this saint replaced the female deity, Ayisit, of their old mythology. Among the Yakut are experienced individuals who know the number of days between holidays since it is easier to deal with immovable feasts. For movable festivals, they must often consult their priest. On the wall of every Yakut dwelling is a calendar, usually consisting of a small board with holes corresponding to the number of days in the year.  The immovable feasts are marked by crosses over the holes. A wooden peg is placed in the hole to indicate the current date, thus showing whether it is an ordinary day or a holiday. Fig. 1 shows a circular calendar; the inner circle has seven perforations, corresponding to the seven days of the week. A peg is shown in the hole for Sunday, over which there is a cross. The outer ring has thirty holes. When the month has thirty-one days, the peg is kept in the last hole for two days. If the month has twenty-nine or twenty-eight days, the peg must be transferred to the first day of the next month. The calendar is called kün ahar,   it counts the days, or  sibaska  (Russian,  svyatzy,  calendar of saints), or  nädiälä asarar mas,  board which shows the week.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-161"><a href="#cite_note-161">[161]</a></sup> 'The Yakut began to count the month by weeks only after Russianization.

The fox is far from  being a rare animal in the north of the region: I saw one on several occasions near people's houses and once witnessed a fox running across the yard of the yurta.  A fox, especially the darker varieties which are larger, can be easily mistaken for a Yakut dog.  The skin of the red fox serves in the north as a unit of exchange. It is priced between 2 and 5 rubles; sivodushka-between 6 &amp; 15 rubles; and the black-brown variety between 25 and 50 rubles.

In winter it comes near human dwellings, gets into the granaries, and eats and carriesaway meat and fish.  It is caught by special traps called hlopushi (chirkan - a mouse trap).  The ermine is a predatory, bold, and curious animal. When irritated it will attack even  human beings.  Cases are known of the ermine inflicting serious wounds on people, for it attempts to cut through the blood vessels on the neck, where it ascends with exceptional speed and agility.

Butter began to go into circulation only when the Russians came and built a city, and particularly when they began to buy it for the mines, maintained the Namsk Yakut (1891).  The Yakut monetary unit ary, which means one bezem of heated butter of two and one-half funts testifies to the trading significance of butter.  In remote corners the Yakut often convert the price of goods from a monetary basis to a butter basis, and express hiring prices and selling prices of objects offered in terms of butter.  The majority of women are only familiar with this system, and get confused in trying to count with money.  Butter comprises one of the most important food products of the Yakut. The poorest Yakut tries to have it on his table  on feast days, and even the stingiest master must feed his workers butter at least once a week.  The Yakut consume butter in various ways: they eat it in hard pieces, they drink it crumbled with kumiss, they drink it in tea, and they drink warm heated butter in its pure form.  In their climate this beverage is far from distasteful, and when coming back chilled from hunting, or frozen through during a long winter journey I would willingly drink a full dish of it myself.  It warms one quickly, and restore's one's strength and vigor, just like grape wine.  A Yakut is able to drink not more than one-half a funt at a gulp, but can drink up to two and one-half funts over a certain period of time, stopping to rest. Sturdy fellows who are able to drink five to ten funts at one time are known in every section , but I do not think that there are more than two or three in the oblast capable of drink one-half a pood; I do not know a their ability to drink a large quantity of melted butter just as Russians boast of their ability to drink large quantities of vodka.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-168"><a href="#cite_note-168">[168]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b> ♠ Indigenous coins ♣ absent ♥ </b></dd>
<dd><b> ♠ Paper currency ♣ absent ♥ </b> No indigenously produced paper currency. Russian money also became an important medium of exchange: 'Yakut also engaged in the fur trade; by the twentieth century hunters for luxury furs had depleted the ermines, sables, and foxes, and they were relying on squirrels. Yakut merchants and transporters spread throughout the entire northeast, easing communications and trade for natives and Russians. They sold luxuries like silver and gold jewelry and carved bone, ivory, and wood crafts in addition to staples such as butter, meat, and hay. Barter, Russian money, and furs formed the media of exchange. Guns were imported, as was iron for local blacksmiths.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-174"><a href="#cite_note-174">[174]</a></sup> Fox, ermine, and deer skins were also sold for money: 'The Yakuts hunt foxes only in autumn and winter by setting up traps and self-released bows. Sometimes foxes get caught in the nooses set up to hares, but rarely perish in the noose trap, since the beam is not sufficiently quick to lift their weight.  The fox eats everything: fish, meat, berries, roots, even the carrions of other foxes that got caught in the trap. The fox is far from  being a rare animal in the north of the region: I saw one on several occasions near people's houses and once witnessed a fox running across the yard of the yurta.  A fox, especially the darker varieties which are larger, can be easily mistaken for a Yakut dog.  The skin of the red fox serves in the north as a unit of exchange. It is priced between 2 and 5 rubles; sivodushka-between 6 &amp; 15 rubles; and the black-brown variety between 25 and 50 rubles.

In winter it comes near human dwellings, gets into the granaries, and eats and carriesaway meat and fish.  It is caught by special traps called hlopushi (chirkan - a mouse trap).  The ermine is a predatory, bold, and curious animal. When irritated it will attack even  human beings.

<dl><dd><b> ♠ Couriers ♣ present ♥ </b> Sieroszewski mentions couriers, but their status as professionals is unclear: 'I spent the autumn of 1884 in the Kolymsk Ulus, at Engzha,  in the home of the old man Ivan Sleptsov, who had just been chosen prince of the Second Kangalas Nasleg.   Once, in the middle of October, a courier was sent to us from the valley of Ungdzha, with an invitation to a wedding.  The clansmen invited their prince, and I was invited to come along.  We had to travel approximately seventy versts on horse-back; we spent one night on the road and arrived at the home of the Yakut Dmitrii, who was holding the wedding, at daybreak on the next day.  He was  giving away his daughter in marriage, and the forthcoming festivity was the first and most important of the  marriage ceremonies.  Approaching the homestead we constantly outrode groups of mounted Yakut, while near the house we encountered a group of women leading a cow.  These all were people belonging to the clan of the  bride: they were hurrying to the wedding.  The bridal trainof the bridegroom, it turned out, was riding behind us.  It consisted of the father of the bridegroom, his uncle,  the match-maker - some distant relative, and an elder cousin of the bridegroom.  All of them were dressed in their best costumes, and rode on their best horses along the road in single file, one behind the other.  At the very end of the procession rode the young bridegroom and led behind him a pair of horses, loaded with  meat. The match-maker also led a pair of pack horses.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-179"><a href="#cite_note-179">[179]</a></sup> On the other hand, the material on the growing postal system (see below) seems to support this.</dd>
<dd><b> ♠ Postal stations ♣ present ♥ </b> During the Russian period, Sakha leaders participated in the growing postal system: 'Yakut oral histories begin well before first contact with Russians in the seventeenth century. For example, OLONKHO (epics) date at least to the tenth century, a period of interethnic mixing, tensions, and upheaval that may have been a formative period in defining Yakut tribal affiliations. Ethnographic and archaeological data suggest that the ancestors of the Yakut, identified in some theories with the Kuriakon people, lived in an area near Lake Baikal and may have been part of the Uighur state bordering China. By the fourteenth century, Yakut ancestors migrated north, perhaps in small refugee groups, with herds of horses and cattle. After arrival in the Lena valley, they fought and intermarried with the native Evenk and Yukagir nomads. Thus, both peaceful and belligerent relations with northern Siberians, Chinese, Mongols, and Turkic peoples preceded Russian hegemony. When the first parties of Cossacks arrived at the Lena River in the 1620s, Yakut received them with hospitality and wariness. Several skirmishes and revolts followed, led at first by the legendary Yakut hero Tygyn. By 1642 the Lena valley was under tribute to the czar; peace was won only after a long siege of a formidable Yakut fortress. By 1700 the fort settlement of Yakutsk (founded 1632) was a bustling Russian administrative, commercial, and religious center and a launching point for further exploration into Kamchatka and Chukotka. Some Yakut moved northeast into territories they had previously not dominated, further assimilating the Evenk and Yukagir. Most Yakut, however, remained in the central meadowlands, sometimes assimilating Russians. Yakut leaders cooperated with Russian commanders and governors, becoming active in trade, fur-tax collection, transport, and the postal system. Fighting among Yakut communities decreased, although horse rustling and occasional anti-Russian violence continued. For example, a Yakut Robin Hood named Manchari led a band that stole from the rich (usually Russians) to give to the poor (usually Yakut) in the nineteenth century. Russian Orthodox priests spread through Yakutia, but their followers were mainly in the major towns. By 1900 a literate Yakut intelligentsia, influenced both by Russian merchants and political exiles, formed a party called the Yakut Union. Yakut revolutionaries such as Oiunskii and Ammosov led the Revolution and civil war in Yakutia, along with Bolsheviks such as the Georgian Ordzhonikidze.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-180"><a href="#cite_note-180">[180]</a></sup> Sieroszewski mentions post horses and post roads: 'The most ancient of the yassak are apparently the post-horses.

This was apparently done often and the news of it even reached Moscow.  In view of this it was ordered to take in the service of the Great Sovereigns... bulls and horses; whatever kind they give you, to ride on it.    Besides this guides and coachmen were needed. Gmelin used Yakut oarsmen during his entire journey of 1732, from the boundary of the Yakutsk Oblast.

For example, in 1636-1637, during the campaign against the Kangalastsy, the Russian Cossacks found that “they had built strong forts with two walls covered with gravel, and surrounded by snow and water;” it was only after a two-day assault that the Cossacks managed to take one of these forts. In 1642 the Russians also took a Yakut fortress after great difficulty: “. . . the fort was made with two walls, the space between the walls was filled with earth, and there were log towers.” At a later stage these fortifications disappeared, and no one has described them since in detail.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Deification_of_Rulers">Deification of Rulers</span></h3>
<p><b>♠ Rulers are legitimated by gods ♣ absent ♥</b> Toyons legitimated their superior position by presenting themselves as patriarchal benefactors: 'Apart from these individual customs, the Yakut society admittedly retained the characteristic, half-conscious patriarchal ideology, which was clearly not a reflection of their true relationships, although it served the interests of the toyons, who knew how to make use of it. The toyons liked to style themselves the forefathers, heads and sponsors of their clans; they skillfully fomented various interclan quarrels (usually [Page 276] over land), thereby sustaining the fiction of community of clan interests. A poor kinsman used to call a toyon who had robbed him of his possessions aga (father), and was expected to look upon him as his “benefactor.”' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-209"><a href="#cite_note-209">[209]</a></sup> Toyons also derived their names from deities: 'In the cult of both the benevolent and malevolent deities, a part was played at one stage by the military aristocracy—the toyons; they were usually the organizers. In their legendary genealogies the toyons often derived their names from the great and powerful deities.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-210"><a href="#cite_note-210">[210]</a></sup> However, we are unsure whether this extended to a form of 'divine' legitimation. We have assumed this was not the case.

<p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of equality ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> The sources report a high degree of cross-cultural and cross-'ethnic' hybridization: 'In the north, beyond the inner mountain range, closer to the sea, where the Yakut population penetrates along the valleys of rivers and brooks far into the mountain country, the influence of Tungus and Yukaghir (Mongol-Manchurian) blood is less strongly felt. The Dolgan, whose way of live is similar to that of the Tungus and who dress in the same way, are taken for Tungus by many, although they speak the Yakut language and their traditions clearly point to a mixed half-Yakut origin. The Yukaghir who at one time inhabited thickly the lower reaches 240 [Page 449] of the Yana, Indigirka, and Kolyma Rivers have disappeared, swallowed up by the Yakut. The same thing has happened to many Tungus clans. In the Kolymsk Ulus I came across many households, known to be Tungus, who lived in the Yakut manner and who had intermarried and become related to the Yakut. In the northern parts of the Dyupsyunsk and Bayagantaysk uluses adjoining the southern spurs of the Verkhoyansk Mountains, where Tungus still lead nomadic lives, numerous Tungus families appear in years of famine; they hire themselves out to the Yakut as workmen, or live at the expense of the ulus. Such families often remain permanently among the Yakut. In cases of their parent's death, orphaned children are willingly adopted by well-to-do Yakut. The same thing happens in other places where Tungus and Yakut live side by side. Many Tungus in the Vilyuysk Okrug have become Yakutized, and some of them even have numerous herds of horned cattle... Most of them speak the Yakut language, and few of them know their nat ive tongue..., Maak remarks on this subject. Each year, in winter, in the Olekminsk Okrug, Tungus come into the Yakut settlements and live there side by side with the Yakut, in the same yurts, during the coldest months.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-211"><a href="#cite_note-211">[211]</a></sup> 'They come at the beginning of Advent and leave at the end of maslyanka (the week before Lent). They bring their hosts presents: furs, nuts, and squirrel and bear meat. They buy horse meat, khayak and flour from the Yakut: they like these things very much. Then life is gay. Every day there is singing and dancing. The Tungus like [Page 450] merriment, the grown-ups as well as the little children; they talk to the Yakut with songs. After the dancing various things happen..., a Yakut woman who had lived in the Olekminsk Okrug for a long time told me (Namsk Ulus, 1887).' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-212"><a href="#cite_note-212">[212]</a></sup> 'The Tungus of the Maya River (a tributary of the Aldan), as can be seen from the travel notes of General Svetlitskii, have also become partly Yakutized and even engage in cattle raising and agriculture. ' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-213"><a href="#cite_note-213">[213]</a></sup> We are unsure whether ethnic stratification (apart from stratification between 'natives' and Russians) was present.
