<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="General_Description">General Description</span></h4>
<dl><dd>The Tokugawa period, also known as the Edo period, ran from 1603 to 1868 CE. Sometimes the slightly earlier start date of 1600 is chosen in recognition of Tokugawa Ieyasu's decisive victory at the Battle of Sekigahara; however, we have selected the 1603 date, which marks his official appointment as shogun. Although the emperor remained the official head of state, the Tokugawa shoguns ruled Japan. The rise to power of the Tokugawa Shogunate marked an end to the internal strife and warfare that had characterized the preceding century. Tokugawa Ieyasu and his immediate successors set about limiting the power of their rivals and instituting new policies aimed at maintaining stability and centralizing Japan's government.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-9"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The 'peak' of the Tokugawa period corresponds to the years between 1688 and 1704 CE, known as the Genroku period, which saw the development of a distinct urban culture and the proliferation of art, theatre and fiction.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> During the early modern period the Japanese polity consisted of three major islands: Honshu, Kyushu and Shikoku.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Eventually, economic difficulties and the threat of Western encroachment helped to bring about the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate. The period came to an end with the resignation of the last Tokugawa shogun in 1867 and the imperial restoration in 1868.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-12"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p><i>Population and political organization</i>
</p>
<dl><dd>The Tokugawa shogunate built on the work of the generals Oda Nobunaga (1534-1582 CE) and Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1536-1598 CE), who between 1568 and 1590 succeeded in uniting all the daimyō (local military lords) under the command of a military leader into a 'national confederation'.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-13"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> Theoretically, the daimyō maintained administrative authority in their own territories, but in practice they were expected to follow the guidance of the shogunate.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-14"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> Tokugawa Ieyasu and his successors pursued a policy of 'orthodoxy and stability',<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-15"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> aimed at consolidating their own power and limiting the ability of their rivals to amass enough power or wealth to enable them to challenge the shogunate. The success of these policies enabled the Tokugawa family to preside over a period of peace and prosperity and rule Japan for the next 268 years.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-16"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> As well as peace, political stability and the centralization of power by the shoguns, the Tokugawa period was characterized by economic prosperity, rising urbanization and the closings of Japan's borders to the wider world in the 1630s.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Theoretically, class was determined by birth and social mobility was prohibited. Influenced by Chinese models, the social order was formalized and essentially frozen in a hierarchy known as <i>shi-nō-kō-shō</i>, 'warrior-peasant-artisan-merchant'.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-18"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> Despite the shogunate's concerted attempts to maintain a strict social orthodoxy, however, the stable and economically prosperous conditions led to a range of social changes, including increasing urbanization and the rise of the merchant class, who (although they were theoretically socially inferior) now held much of the country's wealth.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-19"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> Now that there was no need for the majority of those of samurai rank to be actively engaged in military activities, the warrior class became bureaucratized, a development that went hand-in-hand with a romanticization of the warrior ideal and the codification of proper rules of behaviour.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-20"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>During the Tokugawa period, population censuses were carried out. However, they did not take all members of the population into account and various scholars have therefore used supplementary data to produce what they hope are more accurate estimates.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-21"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> Estimates for the beginning of the period (1600 CE) range from around 15<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-22"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> to 22<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-23"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> million. The population rose to around 30 million by the end of the period.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-24"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-25"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup></dd></dl>

Although the fortunes of particular extended warrior families waxed and waned, only members of the warrior class could serve as shoguns, the military rulers. Their governments, known commonly as shogunates, were often challenged by the interests of other powerful warrior families in various parts of Japan and by the imperial family in Kyoto. Although the warrior bureaucracy largely controlled the affairs of the state, the emperor and the imperial court were still the formal head of government. Warrior governments typically sought out- or forced-the formal imperial decrees that gave legitimacy to the shoguns. Occasionally emperors would attempt to reassert direct imperial rule. They were, however, always suppressed in favor of warrior rule... Warrior governments functioned as a lord-vassal system of loyalty. This is reflected in the political structures of the different shogunates. Although they varied greatly in their organization, the notion of loyalty, whether earned or forced, always laid the foundation on which the warrior government was built.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-47"><a href="#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup> List derived from  ‘Administrative Structure of the Tokugawa Shogunate’.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-48"><a href="#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup> ‘The neat table of organization charts of the Edo bakufu, which list upwards of four hundred posts in chain-of-command order, mask the problems of competition for control of policy and enforcement authority that plagued Edo bakufu politics.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-49"><a href="#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup>

The use of this measure of time began in the seventh century. The change of emperor included a change in era name. However, in the early modern period, the nengo did not simply represent the duration of a governmental regime. New era names might be declared when auspicious events occurred or at certain points in the traditional 60- year (sexagenary) calendar cycle...

Warrior literature was not replaced, but early modern literature is notable for its articulation of the interests and concerns of merchants, artisans, and other nonelite members of early modern society.... Because of the contact with the Dutch, the Dutch language became the medium through which new Western scientific and medical knowledge were disseminated.

In addition, the neck was shielded by a series of three or five metal plates. By the end of the Muromachi period, most ordinary helmets were made from iron and/or steel. The helmet was formed from individual plates fastened with rivets or simply joined together. The top portion of the helmet, shaped like the pate of a human head, was called the hachi. In the early medieval period, from the 11th to 14th centuries, hachi were almost invariably rounded.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-160"><a href="#cite_note-160">[160]</a></sup></dd>

A Japanese suit, fig. 78, consists of a helmet, kabuto, usually made of a large number of narrow plates riveted together with raised edges at the joints. It has a small peak, maizashi, in front and a wide neck guard, shikoro, made of strips of steel or of scales of leather or steel laced together with heavy silk or leather cords. One or more of these pieces is turned back in front to form ear guards, fukigayeshi. The front is usually decorated with two horn-like pieces, kuwagata, representing the leaves of a water plant; between them is an ornament, maidate, corresponding to the European crest. The face is covered by a steel mask, menpo, to which a laminated neck guard, yodare-kake, is attached. There are five varieties of menpo - covering the entire face - all of the face below the eyes - the forehead and cheeks only - and two for the cheeks and chin only. Of these, the second is much most used. A gorget, nodowa, was sometimes worn but was not considered as a regular part of the suit.

<p><b>♠ Ideology reinforces prosociality ♣ present ♥</b> According to Buddhism: "The twofold benefit of living a morally good life is linked to a twofold motivation: ‘Protecting oneself, one protects others; protecting others, one protects oneself ’ - just as each acrobat in a balancing act protects his partner by concentrating on himself, and protects himself by concentrating on his partner (see SN 47:19). If we take care of our own spiritual development, we render a service to others; and if we develop love towards others, we thereby also help ourselves. Accordingly, it is explicitly stated, someone who pursues the path of salvation only for his or her own benefit is to be censured, while the one who follows the path for one’s own benefit and for the benefit of others is to be commended (see AN 7:64)." <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-191"><a href="#cite_note-191">[191]</a></sup> "Three segments of the Noble Eightfold Path (3 - 5) are traditionally subsumed under the principle of morality (sila): ‘right speech’ (3), ‘right action’ (4) and ‘right livelihood’ (5). [...] ‘Right action’ is explained as abstaining from harming and killing sentient beings - including animals (!), and further as abstaining from ‘taking what is not given’ and from sexual misconduct, which means avoiding sexual relations with women who are still under the protection of their families, or with those who are married, betrothed, or celibate for religious reasons. From monks and nuns complete sexual abstention is demanded. ‘Right livelihood’ means abstaining from those sources of income which involve harming other beings: trading in weapons for instance, or trading in living beings, meat, intoxicants or poison; also included is the avoidance of fraud and avarice." <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-192"><a href="#cite_note-192">[192]</a></sup> As for Neo-Confucianism: "There are a number of terms and concepts that regularly appear in the writings of Edo-period Neo-Confucians. [...] Benevolence (jin) is a fundamental Confucian virtue that is concerned with the fundamentally relational and social nature of Confucian ethics and notions of government. Those who have cultivated benevolence express humanity and compassion through the way they treat other people. A person who has cultivated benevolence is able to act toward others in an altruistic way. The attainment of the virtue of benevolence is also considered transformative in the sense that one cannot be truly moral without it." <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-193"><a href="#cite_note-193">[193]</a></sup> Because it syncretised with both Buddhism and Neo-Confucianism <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-194"><a href="#cite_note-194">[194]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-195"><a href="#cite_note-195">[195]</a></sup>, it seems reasonable to infer that Buddhist and Neo-Confucian stances on certain issues applied to Shinto as well.
