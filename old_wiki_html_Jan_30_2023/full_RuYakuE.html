<p><b>♠ RA ♣ Eva Brandl; Dennis Spencer ♥</b> DS contributed the general description.
</p><p><b> ♠ Original name ♣ Sakha ♥ </b> 'The Yakut, who prefer to call themselves "Sakha," [...] are the farthest-north Turkic people, with a consciousness of having once lived farther south kept alive by legends and confirmed by historical and archaeological research.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Alternative names ♣ Urangkhai Sakha; 'Yakut' ♥ </b> The term "Yakut" is frequently found in our sources to refer to the Sakha people. However, Sakha is the preferred self-designated term. Therefore, out of respect, we generally prefer “Sakha” instead of "Yakut", except for source titles and direct quotations.'The Yakut, who prefer to call themselves "Sakha," [...] are the farthest-north Turkic people, with a consciousness of having once lived farther south kept alive by legends and confirmed by historical and archaeological research.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Peak Date ♣ ♥ </b> Before the Russian invasions, the territory was governed by independent Yakut and other tribes:  'The Sakha are thought to be an admixture of migrants from the Lake Baikal region with the aborigines of the Lena-probably mostly Evenk (Evenki), who have contributed much to their culture. Other evidence, however, points to a southern ancestry related to the Turkic-speaking tribes of the steppe and the Altai Mountains. The early history of the Sakha is little known, though epic tales date from the 10th century. In the 17th century they had peacefully assimilated with other northern peoples and consisted of 80 independent tribes, subdivided into clans.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> 'Yakut oral histories begin well before first contact with Russians in the seventeenth century. For example, OLONKHO (epics) date at least to the tenth century, a period of interethnic mixing, tensions, and upheaval that may have been a formative period in defining Yakut tribal affiliations. Ethnographic and archaeological data suggest that the ancestors of the Yakut, identified in some theories with the Kuriakon people, lived in an area near Lake Baikal and may have been part of the Uighur state bordering China. By the fourteenth century, Yakut ancestors migrated north, perhaps in small refugee groups, with herds of horses and cattle. After arrival in the Lena valley, they fought and intermarried with the native Evenk and Yukagir nomads. Thus, both peaceful and belligerent relations with northern Siberians, Chinese, Mongols, and Turkic peoples preceded Russian hegemony. When the first parties of Cossacks arrived at the Lena River in the 1620s, Yakut received them with hospitality and wariness. Several skirmishes and revolts followed, led at first by the legendary Yakut hero Tygyn.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> In the early 17th century, Cossack expeditions invaded Sakha territory and exacted tribute from the population: 'By 1620 a report had reached Tobolsk from the Mangaseya Cossacks of the Great (Lena) River and the Lena Yakut. In 1631 they descended by the Viliui River, a tributary of the Lena, to the Lena River and imposed tribute on the adjacent Yakut. In 1632 a party of Cossacks under the command of the Boyar’s son, Shakov, took tribute in sables from a clan of Viliui horse-breeding Yakut. The Viliui River farther up from its mouth was occupied by Tungus only. The northern boundary of the distribution of the Yakut at that time was the mouth of the Viliui. The whole Lena Valley from the mouth of the Viliui River to the south, at a distance of about 500 kilometers (or 710 miles) was occupied by Yakut. In their possession were also all the Lena islands of that region, rich in  pasture lands. There is no definite information as to how far inland they penetrated at that period. We may admit, however, that the Yakut, being horse and cattle breeders, were hardly inclined to move into the dense forests far from the majority of their tribesmen, i.e., far from the Lena Valley. In the beginning of the seventeenth century the Yakut abode on the western banks of the Lena must have been the territory of the two present  uluses  of Yakutsk District, Namskij and Western Kangalassky. There, according to Yakut traditions, was the first place of refuge of their mythical forefather, the “Tatar” Elliei. From there a part of his nearest descendants could also have emigrated over the Lena islands to the eastern banks of the Lena River, where excellent pastures are as abundant as on the western banks.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> During the Russian period, Czarist administrative and political control was established over Yakut territory: 'By 1642 the Lena valley was under tribute to the czar; peace was won only after a long siege of a formidable Yakut fortress. By 1700 the fort settlement of Yakutsk (founded 1632) was a bustling Russian administrative, commercial, and religious center and a launching point for further exploration into Kamchatka and Chukotka. Some Yakut moved northeast into territories they had previously not dominated, further assimilating the Evenk and Yukagir. Most Yakut, however, remained in the central meadowlands, sometimes assimilating Russians. Yakut leaders cooperated with Russian commanders and governors, becoming active in trade, fur-tax collection, transport, and the postal system. '  <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> It seems to make little sense to identify a peak period prior to Russian rule.

By 1700 the fort settlement of Yakutsk (founded 1632) was a bustling Russian administrative, commercial, and religious center and a launching point for further exploration into Kamchatka and Chukotka.

</p><p><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ quasi-polity ♥ </b> Sakha clan and tribal organization was decentralized: 'Kinship and politics were mixed in the hierarchical council system that guided AQA-USA, AIMAK, and DZHON. Yakut explanations of DZHON in the nineteenth century included concepts like "people," "community," or "tribe," territorially defined. Councils were composed of ranked circles of elders, usually men, whose leaders, TOYONS, were called nobles by Russians. A lineage head was BIS-USA-TOYON; respected warriors and hunters were BATYR. Lineage councils decided major economic issues, interfamily disputes, and questions of blood revenge for violence committed against the group. AIMAK and DZHON councils were infrequent, dealing with issues of security, revenge, alliance, and, before Russian control, war. Through war, slaves were captured for service in the wealthiest TOYON households. Kin-based councils were rare by the nineteenth century and had little influence on twentieth-century politics.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> 'Key kin relations are based on a patrilineage (AQA-USA) that traces membership back nine generations. Within this, children born to a specific mother are distinguished as a group (YE-USA), and may form the basis for different households (KORGON). Historically, more distant kin were recognized on two levels, the AIMAK (or territorial NASLEG), with one to thirty lineages, and the DZHON (or territorial ULUS), composed of several AIMAK. These larger units were united by alliances, including for common defense, alliances, and by economic relations; these links were renewed at councils and festivals.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-12"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>  'The Sakha are thought to be an admixture of migrants from the Lake Baikal region with the aborigines of the Lena-probably mostly Evenk (Evenki), who have contributed much to their culture.

In the 17th century they had peacefully assimilated with other northern peoples and consisted of 80 independent tribes, subdivided into clans.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-13"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>  During the early Russian period, the Czarist administrative structure was superimposed on the Sakha system: 'No less significant changes occurred in the administrative organization of the Yakut country. In the seventeenth century Yakutsk was the center of a great independent country directly subordinate to Moscow, although for some specific questions it was dependent on the governors of Tobolsk. In the time of Peter the Great, Yakutsk entered into the newly organized Siberian Goubernyia (government) and with the division of the Siberian government into provinces was included in Irkutsk Province. In 1775 Irkutsk Province was organized into a government and the Yakut country formed one of the provinces of the new government. '  <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-14"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥ </b> During the Russian period, Sakha came under Czarist political and administrative control: 'By 1642 the Lena valley was under tribute to the czar; peace was won only after a long siege of a formidable Yakut fortress.

<dl><dd><b> ♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Kurumchi Culture ♥ </b> The Kurumchi culture flourished in the Baikal region from the sixth to the tenth century CE, and strongly influenced the Sakha. <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-16"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>New excavation of Sakha graves reveal bent posture burials linked to the early ethnic history of the Yakuts, chronologically associated with the Kulun-Atakh archaeological culture (fourteenth through sixteenth centuries). The closest analogues to bent posture burials are the burial traditions of medieval tribes of Cisbaikalia and Transbaikalia. In the Hunnu-Xianbei time and in the era of the Early Middle Ages, bent posture burials spread into Cisbaikalia in groups of burials of the Elga (3rd century BCE to fourth century CE) and Cherenkhyn (fifth through eight centuries CE). “B.B Dashibalov attributed them to the Kurumchi culture, dated to the fifth through fourteenth centuries CE and left, in his opinion, by the Kurykan and Khori tribes, which subsequently became foundation in the constituting of the Yakuts.” (243)<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b> ♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Czarist Russia ♥ </b> In the early 17th century, Cossack expeditions invaded Sakha territory and exacted tribute from the population: 'By 1620 a report had reached Tobolsk from the Mangaseya Cossacks of the Great (Lena) River and the Lena Yakut. In 1631 they descended by the Viliui River, a tributary of the Lena, to the Lena River and imposed tribute on the adjacent Yakut. In 1632 a party of Cossacks under the command of the Boyar’s son, Shakov, took tribute in sables from a clan of Viliui horse-breeding Yakut. The Viliui River farther up from its mouth was occupied by Tungus only. The northern boundary of the distribution of the Yakut at that time was the mouth of the Viliui. The whole Lena Valley from the mouth of the Viliui River to the south, at a distance of about 500 kilometers (or 710 miles) was occupied by Yakut. In their possession were also all the Lena islands of that region, rich in  pasture lands. There is no definite information as to how far inland they penetrated at that period. We may admit, however, that the Yakut, being horse and cattle breeders, were hardly inclined to move into the dense forests far from the majority of their tribesmen, i.e., far from the Lena Valley. In the beginning of the seventeenth century the Yakut abode on the western banks of the Lena must have been the territory of the two present  uluses  of Yakutsk District, Namskij and Western Kangalassky. There, according to Yakut traditions, was the first place of refuge of their mythical forefather, the “Tatar” Elliei. From there a part of his nearest descendants could also have emigrated over the Lena islands to the eastern banks of the Lena River, where excellent pastures are as abundant as on the western banks.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-20"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> During the Russian period, Sakha came under Czarist political and administrative control: 'By 1642 the Lena valley was under tribute to the czar; peace was won only after a long siege of a formidable Yakut fortress. By 1700 the fort settlement of Yakutsk (founded 1632) was a bustling Russian administrative, commercial, and religious center and a launching point for further exploration into Kamchatka and Chukotka. Some Yakut moved northeast into territories they had previously not dominated, further assimilating the Evenk and Yukagir. Most Yakut, however, remained in the central meadowlands, sometimes assimilating Russians. Yakut leaders cooperated with Russian commanders and governors, becoming active in trade, fur-tax collection, transport, and the postal system.

Russian-era Sakha province covered a territory of considerable size: 'Sakha, also called Yakutiya or Yakut-Sakha, Yakutiya also spelled Yakutia, Udachnaya: diamond mine republic in far northeastern Russia, in northeastern Siberia. The republic occupies the basins of the great rivers flowing to the Arctic Ocean-the Lena, Yana, Indigirka, and Kolyma-and includes the New Siberian Islands between the Laptev and East Siberian seas.

Furthermore, they were pastoralists. This makes the identification of the territory of a 'typical' quasi-polity more difficult.
</p><p><b> ♠ Polity Population ♣ ♥ </b> People. Even in the Russian period, Sakha province was sparsely populated: 'The population to the north of the Verkhoyansk Ridge is very small. This region has only 0.01 man to a quadratic mile, or 1 man to 100 square miles. Settlements are confined to the river valleys and the shores of large lakes abounding in fish. The tundra dweller of Siberia seldom settles on the seacoast or on the adjacent islands, as do the American Eskimo. Since off shore the sea is quite shallow the hunting of sea mammals has not been developed; for instance, the ocean between the mouth of the Kolyma River and the Sviatoi Nos to the west is only seven meters deep at a distance of ten or twenty miles from shore. West of the Chukchee are no sea-going peoples and no skin boats. Late in the fall, when snowstorms begin to rage on the tundra, the nomadic natives wander southward to the protection of the forests.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-41"><a href="#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup> Due to economic hardships the total Sakha population may have decreased during the early Russian period: 'These circumstances undoubtedly discourage the activity of the Yakut, who no longer endeavors to procure wealth, because it is the likeliest means of making him the object of persecution. Thus property, tranquillity, and population decrease. The princes or chiefs dwelling near towns acquire their luxuries, and oppress their dependant tribes to procure wine and brandy in addition to their koumis: this was never known among them till the year 1785. I will farther add, that in 1784 the district of Gigansk produced 4834 tributary natives; but in 1789 their number amounted only to 1938. Mr. Bonnar, the captain of the district of Zashiversk, told me, that the tributary nations in his circle amounted to only half the number that they were five years ago and that these were very poor indeed.”' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-42"><a href="#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup> Prior to Russian rule, the Sakha and other Siberian peoples employed a decentralized clan system.

Stables, corrals, and haying developed in conjunction with hardy breeds of cattle and short, fat, furry horses. Richer families owned hundreds of horses and cattle; poorer ones raised a few cattle or herded for others. A huge variety of dairy products, including fermented mare's milk, (Russian: KUMYS), was the staple food, with meat for special occasions. The diet was augmented by hunting (bears, elk, squirrels, hare, ferrets, fowl), fishing (salmon, carp, MUSKSUN, MUNDU), and, under Russian influence, agriculture (cereals). Wealthy Yakut hunted on horseback using dogs. The poorest Yakut, those without cattle, relied on fishing with horsehair nets and, in the north, herded reindeer like their Evenk and Yukagir neighbors.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-45"><a href="#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup> Only later did Russian invaders build riverside towns: 'In 1632 the Russian invaders erected a little fortress called Lesnoi Ostroshek, on the eastern bank of the Lena; ten years later they transferred it seventy kilometers to the south, where it became the center of the territory under the name of the City of Yakutsk. The fortress, now the City, of Olekminsk was erected by a Cossack party under the command of Buza in 1635. In the summer of 1637 Buza built two flat-bottomed ships, called  kocha,  and descended to the mouth of the Lena River, and traveled in an easterly direction on the Polar Sea. Not far from the mouth of the Omoloi River he was barred by ice and was compelled to abandon his ships.

</p><p>(1) Councils of Clan Unions and Tribal Units (Dzhon/Ulus) (2) Clan (Aimak/Nasleg) and Lineage (Aqa-Usa) Councils comprised of Elders, Prophets (Sesen) and Leaders (Toyon) or 'Princelings'
</p><p>Until at least the 19th century, lineage councils were the primary administrative bodies: 'Kinship and politics were mixed in the hierarchical council system that guided AQA-USA, AIMAK, and DZHON. Yakut explanations of DZHON in the nineteenth century included concepts like "people," "community," or "tribe," territorially defined. Councils were composed of ranked circles of elders, usually men, whose leaders, TOYONS, were called nobles by Russians. A lineage head was BIS-USA-TOYON; respected warriors and hunters were BATYR. Lineage councils decided major economic issues, interfamily disputes, and questions of blood revenge for violence committed against the group. AIMAK and DZHON councils were infrequent, dealing with issues of security, revenge, alliance, and, before Russian control, war. Through war, slaves were captured for service in the wealthiest TOYON households. Kin-based councils were rare by the nineteenth century and had little influence on twentieth-century politics.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-47"><a href="#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup> 'Key kin relations are based on a patrilineage (AQA-USA) that traces membership back nine generations. Within this, children born to a specific mother are distinguished as a group (YE-USA), and may form the basis for different households (KORGON). Historically, more distant kin were recognized on two levels, the AIMAK (or territorial NASLEG), with one to thirty lineages, and the DZHON (or territorial ULUS), composed of several AIMAK. These larger units were united by alliances, including for common defense, alliances, and by economic relations; these links were renewed at councils and festivals.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-48"><a href="#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup> 'Prophets' and other elders dominated most councils: 'According to tradition, the seseny played no minor role in assemblies in the past.  The word sesen comes from the same root as the verb sesenibin - I advise, I think, I predict. Legend portrayes the seseny as  white-haired, honored, experienced elders.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-49"><a href="#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup> 'This dignity was neither elective nor hereditary, but not every old man was considered to be a sesen.  For  this he had to have a special gift of prophecy - in other words: an acknowledged intellect, experience, and knowledge.  In difficult moments the heroes of olongo frequently turn to such advice-giving, honored, light-eyed Old Men-Talkers.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-50"><a href="#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup> 'In the past we did not decide anything without sesen.  (Namsk Ulus, 1888).  I will note that in this testimony sesen is used in the sense of sorcerer.  The sesen decided disputed questions on the basis of custom, and gave advice when the clan was undergoing hard times.  At ysyakh, before the games and contests  began, the sesen of each clan or clan union would look over their own wrestlers; and they would remove those who were not good enough, who had recently sinned with a woman, who did not restrain themselves sufficiently in eating and drinking, so that they would not bring  shame to their own people. They found all this out by feeling the body of the wrestlers, and by looking into their eyes and face. (Namsk Ulus, 1891).  In the Bayagantaysk Ulus, when I asked who had named the rivers, hills, and other natural features, they answered: It must be the sesen - the old, ancient men, who knew everything!  (Bayagantaysk Ulus, 1885).' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-51"><a href="#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup> Sesens were often from the toen class: 'Since within the clan many sesen were at the same time toen, i.e., the representatives of separate groups, they wielded enormous influencein clan councils. Usually in legends they  are simply called old men - ogonior.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-52"><a href="#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup> Clan unions and tribal units also held council: 'They wielded less importance in councils of clan unions: there the first place was held by the heads of the clans, bis' usa toeno.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-53"><a href="#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup> It seems that the Russian period was preceded by a period of heightened social stratification favouring the Toyons: 'At this period, however, the clan-tribal structure was already in a state of decomposition. The tribes and clans were headed by the military aristocracy-the toyons. These possessed large herds of cattle and employed the labor of slaves and dependent fellow clansmen on their farms; they were also the military leaders. Heading detachments of armed servants and junior fellow clansmen, the toyons raided each other’s territory, and frequently looted the farms of the free members of the community, seizing their cattle and destroying their economic independence. These toyon wars and raids were one of the factors which speeded up the decomposition of the clan commune. The ruined members of the commune were reduced to the status of “balyksyts” (poor people without cattle, or fishermen), or else became the indentured slaves of the toyons. Most of the slaves (kuluts or bokans) originated in this way.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-54"><a href="#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup> The Russian administration later reinforced kin-based hierarchies and superimposed a supratribal structure onto the Sakha system (see next sheet):  'The system of tsarist administration was no different here from what existed in any other part of Northern Siberia. The Dolgans, Yakuts and Evenks had to pay the fur-tax as “natives” and formed “clans” headed by princelings, while the tundra peasants were forced to pay a poll tax, were formed into a “community” and headed by an elder. People living many hundreds of kilometers away from the nearest centers were economically dependent on the merchants who monopolized supplies to the region, bought up all the furs, and cruelly exploited the population.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-55"><a href="#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bureaucracy_characteristics">Bureaucracy characteristics</span></h3>
<p><b> ♠ Full-time bureaucrats ♣ absent ♥ </b> Full-time specialists. Prior to Russian rule, Sakha communities were governed by lineage councils, clans, and elders rather than a statist bureaucratic system.  Until at least the 19th century, lineage councils were the primary administrative bodies: 'Kinship and politics were mixed in the hierarchical council system that guided AQA-USA, AIMAK, and DZHON. Yakut explanations of DZHON in the nineteenth century included concepts like "people," "community," or "tribe," territorially defined. Councils were composed of ranked circles of elders, usually men, whose leaders, TOYONS, were called nobles by Russians. A lineage head was BIS-USA-TOYON; respected warriors and hunters were BATYR. Lineage councils decided major economic issues, interfamily disputes, and questions of blood revenge for violence committed against the group. AIMAK and DZHON councils were infrequent, dealing with issues of security, revenge, alliance, and, before Russian control, war. Through war, slaves were captured for service in the wealthiest TOYON households. Kin-based councils were rare by the nineteenth century and had little influence on twentieth-century politics.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-85"><a href="#cite_note-85">[85]</a></sup> 'Key kin relations are based on a patrilineage (AQA-USA) that traces membership back nine generations. Within this, children born to a specific mother are distinguished as a group (YE-USA), and may form the basis for different households (KORGON). Historically, more distant kin were recognized on two levels, the AIMAK (or territorial NASLEG), with one to thirty lineages, and the DZHON (or territorial ULUS), composed of several AIMAK. These larger units were united by alliances, including for common defense, alliances, and by economic relations; these links were renewed at councils and festivals.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-86"><a href="#cite_note-86">[86]</a></sup> 'Prophets' and other elders dominated most councils: 'According to tradition, the seseny played no minor role in assemblies in the past.  The word sesen comes from the same root as the verb sesenibin - I advise, I think, I predict. Legend portrayes the seseny as  white-haired, honored, experienced elders.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-87"><a href="#cite_note-87">[87]</a></sup> 'This dignity was neither elective nor hereditary, but not every old man was considered to be a sesen.  For  this he had to have a special gift of prophecy - in other words: an acknowledged intellect, experience, and knowledge.  In difficult moments the heroes of olongo frequently turn to such advice-giving, honored, light-eyed Old Men-Talkers.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-88"><a href="#cite_note-88">[88]</a></sup> 'In the past we did not decide anything without sesen.  (Namsk Ulus, 1888).  I will note that in this testimony sesen is used in the sense of sorcerer.  The sesen decided disputed questions on the basis of custom, and gave advice when the clan was undergoing hard times.  At ysyakh, before the games and contests  began, the sesen of each clan or clan union would look over their own wrestlers; and they would remove those who were not good enough, who had recently sinned with a woman, who did not restrain themselves sufficiently in eating and drinking, so that they would not bring  shame to their own people. They found all this out by feeling the body of the wrestlers, and by looking into their eyes and face. (Namsk Ulus, 1891).  In the Bayagantaysk Ulus, when I asked who had named the rivers, hills, and other natural features, they answered: It must be the sesen - the old, ancient men, who knew everything!  (Bayagantaysk Ulus, 1885).' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-89"><a href="#cite_note-89">[89]</a></sup> Sesens were often from the toen class: 'Since within the clan many sesen were at the same time toen, i.e., the representatives of separate groups, they wielded enormous influencein clan councils. Usually in legends they  are simply called old men - ogonior.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-90"><a href="#cite_note-90">[90]</a></sup> Clan unions and tribal units also held council: 'They wielded less importance in councils of clan unions: there the first place was held by the heads of the clans, bis' usa toeno.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-91"><a href="#cite_note-91">[91]</a></sup> It seems that the Russian period was preceded by a period of heightened social stratification favouring the Toyons: 'At this period, however, the clan-tribal structure was already in a state of decomposition. The tribes and clans were headed by the military aristocracy-the toyons. These possessed large herds of cattle and employed the labor of slaves and dependent fellow clansmen on their farms; they were also the military leaders. Heading detachments of armed servants and junior fellow clansmen, the toyons raided each other’s territory, and frequently looted the farms of the free members of the community, seizing their cattle and destroying their economic independence. These toyon wars and raids were one of the factors which speeded up the decomposition of the clan commune. The ruined members of the commune were reduced to the status of “balyksyts” (poor people without cattle, or fishermen), or else became the indentured slaves of the toyons. Most of the slaves (kuluts or bokans) originated in this way.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-92"><a href="#cite_note-92">[92]</a></sup> The Russian administration later reinforced kin-based hierarchies and superimposed a supratribal structure onto the Yakut system (see next sheet):  'The system of tsarist administration was no different here from what existed in any other part of Northern Siberia. The Dolgans, Yakuts and Evenks had to pay the fur-tax as “natives” and formed “clans” headed by princelings, while the tundra peasants were forced to pay a poll tax, were formed into a “community” and headed by an elder. People living many hundreds of kilometers away from the nearest centers were economically dependent on the merchants who monopolized supplies to the region, bought up all the furs, and cruelly exploited the population.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-93"><a href="#cite_note-93">[93]</a></sup>

An injury received by one of them is very rarely forgotten, and, if he cannot revenge it himself, he will leave the feud to his son. Their passion for litigation is excessive: they will frequently undertake difficult and expensive journeys, in a cause where perhaps the matter in dispute is not of the value of a rouble. Their unsocial dispo-sition, which leads them to prefer settling by single families at a distance from each other, is strikingly contrasted with the cheerful and ready hospitality which they show to strangers. They very seldom settle in communities, and it is only along the route from Jakuzk to the Aldan, where the country is more populous, that such settlements are now and then to be met with; but beyond the Werchojansk chain, the solitary  jurti  are often hundreds of wersts apart, so that the nearest neighbours may not see each other for years. Such distances are far greater than can be required on account of pasture, and are rather to be ascribed to the disposition which leads them to seek solitude, and to avoid all social intercourse.”' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-95"><a href="#cite_note-95">[95]</a></sup> Criminal cases were transferred to courts applying Russian law only after 1889: 'Nevertheless until very r ecently and even criminal cases such as beatings, personal injury, and thefts, even for a considerable amount, as long as a house was not broken into, were judged by the clan administration.

In order to diminish the freezing of the ice-holes during the night, the Yakut frequently cover them with straw covers and with snow. In this connection I may note that the ice on the lakes with ice-holes freezes apparently in a thicker layer than on the lakes on which no ice-holes are cut. In spring, [Page 328] when the nearest watering places are exhausted or have been frozen up, it becomes necessary on occasions to drive the cattle to a watering place about two viersts away, which is very inconvenient.

The yurts were oblong huts with slanted earth walls, low ceilings, sod roofs and dirt floors. Most had an adjoining room for cattle. They had substantial hearths, and fur-covered benches lining the walls demarcated sleeping arrangements according to social protocol. Yurts faced east, toward benevolent deities. In summer families moved to larger encampments with their animals. The most ancient summer homes, URASY, were elegant birch-bark conical tents. Some could hold one hundred people.

In comparing these characters with those of various alphabets, it may readily be observed that many of them are similar, as far as they can be deciphered, to the characters of the Orkhon alphabet. There were thirty-seven symbols of which twenty-one are letters and sixteen indistinct, effaced signs, including perhaps mere scratches. The twenty-one letters appear to be an exact reproduction of the Yenisei-Orkhon characters. There are eighteen consonants and three vowels. Some of the characters are repeated and in all there are ten different symbols. The discovery of these writings so far to the north is of great interest. The ancestors of the Yakut, who, in remote times, emigrated from northern Mongolia, undoubtedly knew the Orkhon alphabet and this may explain the Yakut traditions as to the loss of their writings on the way to Yakutsk Province.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-115"><a href="#cite_note-115">[115]</a></sup> The first recent script for the Yakut language was developed by 19th century Russian missionaries: 'The Yakut speak Yakut, a Northeast Turkic language of the Altaic Language Family.

<dd><b> ♠ Calendar ♣ absent ♥ </b> The Sakha initially used a nonwritten lunar calender: 'The ancient Yakut divided the year into lunar months ( yi-syl ). According to Jonov, one year ( tögürüksyl ) in our calendar was regarded as two years: spring and summer were counted as one year and fall and winter as another. Consequently, the time count in old Yakut traditions is much confused. For example, after two years in our count had passed, the Yakut may have said that four years had elapsed. The month was divided into two sections. The first half, until full moon, was called “the new” ( sañata ); the second half, following the full moon, “the old” ( ärgätä ). The days in the first half of the month are enumerated regularly from one to fifteen; in the second half, they are counted in reverse order, from fifteen to one. Thus, there are two fifteenth days in the month, one at the end of the first half and another at the beginning of the second half. Some moments in the phases of the moon are poetically defined; for instance, of the first day of the first half of the month, the Yakut say:  kys jaxtar kylamanbin kurduk kylbayan taxs[unknown]yta,  it glistened like the eyelash of a young girl; of the twenty-eighth day (the Yakut second day of the second half of the month) they say:  xotun jaxtar ytarhatyn iämähin saha ärgi[unknown]ciyä baranyta,  it ends like the size of a woman’s earring.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-117"><a href="#cite_note-117">[117]</a></sup></dd>

Approaching the homestead we constantly outrode groups of mounted Yakut, while near the house we encountered a group of women leading a cow.  These all were people belonging to the clan of the  bride: they were hurrying to the wedding.  The bridal train of the bridegroom, it turned out, was riding behind us.  It consisted of the father of the bridegroom, his uncle,  the match-maker - some distant relative, and an elder cousin of the bridegroom.  All of them were dressed in their best costumes, and rode on their best horses along the road in single file, one behind the other.  At the very end of the procession rode the young bridegroom and led behind him a pair of horses, loaded with  meat. The match-maker also led a pair of pack horses.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-119"><a href="#cite_note-119">[119]</a></sup> We have assumed that prior to Russian rule, messengers were community members rather than professionals.</dd>
<dd><b> ♠ Postal stations ♣ absent ♥ </b> Postal stations and services were introduced under Russian rule. During the Russian period, Sakha leaders participated in the growing postal system: 'Yakut oral histories begin well before first contact with Russians in the seventeenth century. For example, OLONKHO (epics) date at least to the tenth century, a period of interethnic mixing, tensions, and upheaval that may have been a formative period in defining Yakut tribal affiliations. Ethnographic and archaeological data suggest that the ancestors of the Yakut, identified in some theories with the Kuriakon people, lived in an area near Lake Baikal and may have been part of the Uighur state bordering China. By the fourteenth century, Yakut ancestors migrated north, perhaps in small refugee groups, with herds of horses and cattle. After arrival in the Lena valley, they fought and intermarried with the native Evenk and Yukagir nomads. Thus, both peaceful and belligerent relations with northern Siberians, Chinese, Mongols, and Turkic peoples preceded Russian hegemony. When the first parties of Cossacks arrived at the Lena River in the 1620s, Yakut received them with hospitality and wariness. Several skirmishes and revolts followed, led at first by the legendary Yakut hero Tygyn. By 1642 the Lena valley was under tribute to the czar; peace was won only after a long siege of a formidable Yakut fortress. By 1700 the fort settlement of Yakutsk (founded 1632) was a bustling Russian administrative, commercial, and religious center and a launching point for further exploration into Kamchatka and Chukotka. Some Yakut moved northeast into territories they had previously not dominated, further assimilating the Evenk and Yukagir. Most Yakut, however, remained in the central meadowlands, sometimes assimilating Russians. Yakut leaders cooperated with Russian commanders and governors, becoming active in trade, fur-tax collection, transport, and the postal system. Fighting among Yakut communities decreased, although horse rustling and occasional anti-Russian violence continued. For example, a Yakut Robin Hood named Manchari led a band that stole from the rich (usually Russians) to give to the poor (usually Yakut) in the nineteenth century. Russian Orthodox priests spread through Yakutia, but their followers were mainly in the major towns. By 1900 a literate Yakut intelligentsia, influenced both by Russian merchants and political exiles, formed a party called the Yakut Union. Yakut revolutionaries such as Oiunskii and Ammosov led the Revolution and civil war in Yakutia, along with Bolsheviks such as the Georgian Ordzhonikidze.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-120"><a href="#cite_note-120">[120]</a></sup></dd>

It is narrow, about two and one-half or three inches wide, even, with a narrow butt, lacks a puncher or a butt edge, and has a straight, thin cutting edge.  These features, and also the size of the axe, bring it very close to the Siberian axes of the late Bronze Age.

Many of them had coats of mail (kuyakh) made from plates of iron and bone sewn over a leather caftan.  In most cases these wanderers were mounted, but there were some who went on foot. Their weapons consisted of a light, bent, birch bow (okh), 5. a quiver (kikhek) filled with arrows (aya), a  knife, and a war spear (batyya).

To such weapons belongs the Yakut war spear, (fig. 126).  Its blade is more than three-quarters of one arshin long, with a straight, dull back and a sharp point; in the middle the point becomes slightly wider so that it forms a broken line.  At the handle it is one and one-quarter inches wide, and at the widest place, one and one-half inches.  It is one-eighth of an inch thick. Its birchwood handle becomes narrower toward the end. At the blade it is no more   than one inch in diameter.  Frequently it is bound with the sinews of cattle, covered with nielloed hideand decorated on both sides with two narrow longtitudinal strips of white birch. In general the batas is a good-looking, light war weapon, once greatly loved by the Yakut.

<p><b>♠ Rulers are legitimated by gods ♣ absent ♥</b> Toyons legitimated their superior position by presenting themselves as patriarchal benefactors: 'Apart from these individual customs, the Yakut society admittedly retained the characteristic, half-conscious patriarchal ideology, which was clearly not a reflection of their true relationships, although it served the interests of the toyons, who knew how to make use of it. The toyons liked to style themselves the forefathers, heads and sponsors of their clans; they skillfully fomented various interclan quarrels (usually [Page 276] over land), thereby sustaining the fiction of community of clan interests. A poor kinsman used to call a toyon who had robbed him of his possessions aga (father), and was expected to look upon him as his “benefactor.”' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-149"><a href="#cite_note-149">[149]</a></sup> Toyons also derived their names from deities: 'In the cult of both the benevolent and malevolent deities, a part was played at one stage by the military aristocracy—the toyons; they were usually the organizers. In their legendary genealogies the toyons often derived their names from the great and powerful deities.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-150"><a href="#cite_note-150">[150]</a></sup> However, we are unsure whether this extended to a form of 'divine' legitimation. We have assumed this was not the case.

The sources report a high degree of cross-cultural and cross-'ethnic' hybridization: 'In the north, beyond the inner mountain range, closer to the sea, where the Yakut population penetrates along the valleys of rivers and brooks far into the mountain country, the influence of Tungus and Yukaghir (Mongol-Manchurian) blood is less strongly felt. The Dolgan, whose way of live is similar to that of the Tungus and who dress in the same way, are taken for Tungus by many, although they speak the Yakut language and their traditions clearly point to a mixed half-Yakut origin. The Yukaghir who at one time inhabited thickly the lower reaches 240 [Page 449] of the Yana, Indigirka, and Kolyma Rivers have disappeared, swallowed up by the Yakut. The same thing has happened to many Tungus clans. In the Kolymsk Ulus I came across many households, known to be Tungus, who lived in the Yakut manner and who had intermarried and become related to the Yakut. In the northern parts of the Dyupsyunsk and Bayagantaysk uluses adjoining the southern spurs of the Verkhoyansk Mountains, where Tungus still lead nomadic lives, numerous Tungus families appear in years of famine; they hire themselves out to the Yakut as workmen, or live at the expense of the ulus. Such families often remain permanently among the Yakut. In cases of their parent's death, orphaned children are willingly adopted by well-to-do Yakut. The same thing happens in other places where Tungus and Yakut live side by side. Many Tungus in the Vilyuysk Okrug have become Yakutized, and some of them even have numerous herds of horned cattle... Most of them speak the Yakut language, and few of them know their nat ive tongue..., Maak remarks on this subject. Each year, in winter, in the Olekminsk Okrug, Tungus come into the Yakut settlements and live there side by side with the Yakut, in the same yurts, during the coldest months.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-151"><a href="#cite_note-151">[151]</a></sup> 'They come at the beginning of Advent and leave at the end of maslyanka (the week before Lent). They bring their hosts presents: furs, nuts, and squirrel and bear meat. They buy horse meat, khayak and flour from the Yakut: they like these things very much. Then life is gay. Every day there is singing and dancing. The Tungus like [Page 450] merriment, the grown-ups as well as the little children; they talk to the Yakut with songs. After the dancing various things happen..., a Yakut woman who had lived in the Olekminsk Okrug for a long time told me (Namsk Ulus, 1887).' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-152"><a href="#cite_note-152">[152]</a></sup> 'The Tungus of the Maya River (a tributary of the Aldan), as can be seen from the travel notes of General Svetlitskii, have also become partly Yakutized and even engage in cattle raising and agriculture. ' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-153"><a href="#cite_note-153">[153]</a></sup> We are unsure whether ethnic stratification was present. More material is needed before a coding decision can be taken.
