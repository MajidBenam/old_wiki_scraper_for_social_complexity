</p><p><b> ♠ Original name ♣ Achik; Mande ♥ </b> 'Garo' is the most frequently used term in the ethnographic literature. However, A'chik is the preferred self-designated term. Therefore, out of respect, we generally prefer “A'chik” instead of "Garo", except for source titles and direct quotations. ‘The Garos constitute one of the most important tribal communities in East and West Garo Hills. The Garos call themselves A’chik (Hill man), Mande (Man) or A’chik Mande. Ethnically, the Garos belong the the Tibeto-Burman race, whose cradle is said to have been North-West China, between the upper waters of Yang-tse Kiang and Hoang-Ho. The Garos have a close affinity with the Bodos, Kacharis, Kochs and such allied tribes of Assam valley.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> ‘As stated earlier, the Garos prefer to call themselves as “A’chik or A’chik manderang” and as such, the appropriate term for their land will be “A’chik A’song” or “A’chik Land”.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> ‘The word ‘Mande’ generally indicated ‘human being’ to differentiate from other beings as ‘Mande or Matburung’ (man or animal) and “Mande or Me’mang” (man or ghost). It is exceptionally used in rare cases to indicate the whole community from others like ‘Mandema ba Rori’ ‘Mandema Nepali’ that is whether hill man or plain people and Nepali. But it is not commonly used for the whole community. A’chik is suffixed by the word Mande as “A’chik manderang”, and in short form as “A’chikrang”.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> The term 'Garo' is not used as an ethnonym by the people themselves: ‘There remains an obscurity about the origin of the word 'Garo.' They are known as 'Garos' to outsiders; but the Garos always designate themselves as 'Achik' ('hill man').’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>  Many members of the group self-define as ‘Garo’ when talking to outsiders, but it can also be used as an offensive term (seems to depend on tone and context). <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> "At present, Bangladeshi Garos refer to themselves as Mandi (which literally means 'human being'), whereas Indian Garos generally call themselves as Achik (hill dweller). Historical data show that different groups used different names in the past, and that there was never one name for all". ‘The word ‘Garo’ is not a Garo word and hence it has no meaning in their language. In fact, they never utter the word among themselves nor do they like to be called by that name.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> The etymological history of the term 'Garo' is unclear, but the word might be of Boro origin: ‘P.C. Bhattacharya in his ‘Notes on Boro, Garo and Shans’ pointed out the possibility of the word ‘Garo’ to be of Boro origin. The word ‘Garo’ has two morphemes, Gar + o and meaning ‘one who has left’ or ‘separated’. The Lexico Statistical Dating Analysis conducted by Robbins Burling and P.C.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Temporal_bounds">Temporal bounds</span></h4>
<p><b> ♠ Duration  ♣ 1775-1867 CE ♥ </b> ‘After settling in the hills, Garos initially had no close and constant contact with the inhabitants of the adjoining plains. In 1775-76 the Zamindars of Mechpara and Karaibari (at present in the Goalpara and Dhubri districts of Assam) led expeditions onto the Garo hills. The first contact with British colonialists was in 1788, and the area was brought under administrative control in the year 1873.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-15"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> During the 19th century, the Indian subcontinent was subject to increasing colonial influence, ‘a process that culminated in the decline of the ruling Muslim elite and absorption of the subcontinent within the British Empire. Direct administration by the British, which began in 1858, effected a political and economic unification of the subcontinent. When British rule came to an end in 1947, the subcontinent was partitioned along religious lines into two separate countries-India, with a majority of Hindus, and Pakistan, with a majority of Muslims; the eastern portion of Pakistan later split off to form Bangladesh. Many British institutions stayed in place (such as the parliamentary system of government)’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-16"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ quasi-polity ♥ </b> Prior to British imperial rule, the A’chik tribal population was not organized around a common political or administrative centre, with clans and lineages being the only supra-local social institutions: ‘The Garos are divided into nine subtribes: the Awe, Chisak, Matchi-Dual, Matabeng, Ambeng, Ruga-Chibox, Gara-Ganching, Atong, and the Megam. These are geographic subtribes, but are also dialectal and subcultural groups. According to their beliefs and religion, the Garos are divided into the SONGSAREK (following their indigenous beliefs and practices) and the Christians.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ ♥ </b> The potential role of Zamindars remains to be confirmed. 'Zamindar, in India, a holder or occupier (dār) of land (zamīn). The root words are Persian, and the resulting name was widely used wherever Persian influence was spread by the Mughals or other Indian Muslim dynasties. The meanings attached to it were various. In Bengal the word denoted a hereditary tax collector who could retain 10 percent of the revenue he collected. In the late 18th century the British government made these zamindars landowners, thus creating a landed aristocracy in Bengal and Bihar that lasted until Indian independence (1947). In parts of north India (e.g., Uttar Pradesh), a zamindar denoted a large landowner with full proprietary rights. More generally in north India, zamindar denoted the cultivator of the soil or joint proprietors holding village lands in common as joint heirs. In Maratha territories the name was generally applied to all local hereditary revenue officers.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-18"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> Zamindars located in Assam led expeditions into the Garo Hills and subjugated parts of them: ‘There remains no record of when the Garos migrated and settled in their present habitat. Their traditional lore as recorded by Major Playfair points out that they migrated to the area from Tibet. There is evidence that the area was inhabited by the stone-using peoples-Palaeolithic and Neolithic groups-in the past. After settling in the hills, Garos initially had no close and constant contact with the inhabitants of the adjoining plains. In 1775-76 the Zamindars of Mechpara and Karaibari (at present in the Goalpara and Dhubri districts of Assam) led expeditions onto the Garo hills.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-19"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>  ‘In pre-British days the areas adjacent to the present habitat of the Garo were under the Zeminders of Karaibari, Kalumalupara, Habraghat, Mechpara and Sherpore. Garos of the adjoining areas had to struggle constantly with these Zeminders. Whenever the employees of the Zeminders tried to collect taxes or to oppress the Garo in some way or other, they retaliated by coming down to the plains and murdering ryots of the Zeminders. In 1775-76 the Zeminders of Mechpara and Karaibari led expeditions to the hills near about their Zeminderies and subjugated a portion of what is at present the Garo Hills district. The Zeminder of Karaibari appointed Rengtha or Pagla, a Garo as his subordinate.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-20"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup>

Others are the Hajong, the Koch, the Rabha, the Dalau, and the Banais who reside on the adjacent plains of the neighboring district. There remains an obscurity about the origin of the word 'Garo.' They are known as 'Garos' to outsiders; but the Garos always designate themselves as 'Achik' ('hill man'). The Garos are divided into nine subtribes: the Awe, Chisak, Matchi-Dual, Matabeng, Ambeng, Ruga-Chibox, Gara-Ganching, Atong, and the Megam. These are geographic subtribes, but are also dialectal and subcultural groups.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-29"><a href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup> ‘Linguistic affinities and personal traits clearly show that the Garos are only a division of the great Bodo race of Assam. The Bodos were spread, as at present, throughout the whole of the Brahmaputra valley as well as in North Bengal. Aryans are now generally believed to have entered into Assam by two routes, one leading from the west through the Gangetic valley and the other through the Himalayas along the courses of the rivers entering Assam. The Bodos who were the earlier inhabitants of the province also came here in different hordes and following different routes from the north-west as well as from the north-east. It  may be supposed that the Bodos, before entering into Assam and North Bengal which might have been then a part of Assam (Kamrupa of Old), divided themselves into groups somewhere in the Himalayan kingdom of Tibet. I think the ancestors of the Garos of Assam came down from Tibet to Bhutan and thence by following the course of the river Sonkos and her tributaries to Dhubri (now headquarters of the district of Goalpara) and this might be the latest migration of the people of the Bodo race into Assam and North Bengal. These people then crossed the Brahmaputra at different points and populated the southern parts of Goalpara, the northern and the western parts of the Garo Hills and then gradually they spread in the entire Garo Hills and some parts of the Kamrup district.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-30"><a href="#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup> ’Linguistically and ethnologically, the Garos belong to the Bodo family, who were one-time occupants of a large part of the Brahmaputra valley but were probably pushed into the hills by later invaders.

</p><p>(2) Village; (1) Hamlet
</p><p>The A’chik population was mostly rural, relying on subsistence agriculture. The following information is taken from the 'colonial era' data sheet and therefore remains in need of verification. Residential villages varied in size: ‘Villages are scattered and distant from one another in the interior areas. These villages are generally situated on the top of hillocks. The houses are built together with granaries, firewood sheds, and pig sties. The houses are built, together with granaries, firewood sheds, and pigsties, on piles around the slope of the hillock, using locally available bamboo, wood, grass, etc. The approach to the rectangular house is always built facing the leveled surface of the top, while the rear part of the house remains horizontal to the slope. Nowadays new pile-type buildings using wood and iron as major components are being made in some traditional villages also. In addition, buildings similar to those of the neighboring plains are also constructed. The villages may remain distant from agricultural fields (JHUM). In order to guard a crop (during agricultural seasons) from damage by wild animals, the people build temporary watchtowers (BORANQ) in trees in the field. Bachelor dormitories exist in some villages for meetings and recreation.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-59"><a href="#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup> The mean size of villages may have decreased during the colonial period: ‘In former days, Garo villages were of considerable size and used to contain as many as two or three hundred houses. Liability to attack by a neighbouring village made this necessary, and the danger was further guarded against by sowing the approaches with sharp-pointed bamboo stakes called  wamisi in Garo, but better known as  panjis. These presented a very formidable obstacle to an enemy, and effectually prevented a sudden attack. Nowadays, when every man is at peace with his neighbour, the necessity no longer exists for large collections of houses, and the difficulty of finding sufficient land close to big villages for the support of their inhabitants, has resulted in their being broken up into small hamlets situated perhaps as much as four or five miles apart, which, however, in most cases, retain the name of the parent village. In order to distinguish them there is added to the name of each hamlet the name of its  nokma, or headman.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-60"><a href="#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup> ‘In Garo society the village is the largest group of which all the members regularly join in cooperative activities, but more extensive organizations are also recognized. First, several neighboring villages may be considered to be related. One of these is usually believed to have been the original village from which the founders of the other “daughter” villages moved. [...] The peace which the British imposed on the hills may have made it possible to live in smaller and more scattered villages than the people had formerly done. Perhaps most of the groups of linked villages that are now to be found have resulted from the splitting of larger villages during the period of British rule. The difficulty of access to the fields would make more dispersed settlement desirable so long as enemies did not threaten. Nowadays villages only rarely move, split up, or die out. I saw just one village in the process of being moved. This was an undertaking that was destined to last for three years, since the villagers could not muster sufficient labor to rebuild more than a third of their houses in a single year. The move was being made solely for the sake of the water supply, which was failing at the old site.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-61"><a href="#cite_note-61">[61]</a></sup> New villages grew out of small pioneer hamlets: ‘There are different sizes of village in the Garo Hills. I have seen small villages consisting of two or three huts, practically isolated from all the advantages of a big village. On the other hand, in a big village there may be as many as fifty or more huts. The size of the big village entirely depends on the space that is available for the house building and also the facilities the inhabitants of the village may derive for cultivation and other purposes from the surroundings of the locality. The largest village, I visited, was situated on the slopes of the hills, as is the usual practice, facing long strip of valley, nearly about a mile and a half long and about half a mile broad. It is easily understandable that people living in such villages take to plough and utilise the valley for agricultural purposes. It has, therefore, the advantage of accommodating larger people than it is possible for the village which is situated on the hill slopes and which is to depend primarily on  jhum cultivation as described hereafter. Usually, an average sized village contains ten to fifteen houses. The economic factor is one of the main guiding principles regarding the expansion of a village. Availability of arrable land or hillocks for jhum cultivation, good drinking water, facilities of conveyance and also facilities of market places are some of the main factors, which the Garos consider before they fix up a place to start a new village. The common practice is to have one house for one family consisting of husband, wife, and children. Occasionally, the old mother or the mother-in-law also stays in the family.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-62"><a href="#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup>

</p><p>(1) Village Headmen (Nokma) and Councils;
</p><p>Clans and lineages exercised social control on the village and local levels: ‘In Garo society the most important social group is the clan known as MACHONG. A machong is an exogamous matrilineal descent group wherein a Garo is automatically assigned by birth to the unilineal group of his mother. A CHATCHI (moiety) is divided into many machong. Each married couple chooses one daughter--or, if they have none, they adopt a close relative of the mother--to be heiress (NAKNA DONQIPIKA MECHIK) of the family. Her husband traditionally is selected from the lineage group of the father and is accepted as the NOKROM of the house. He resides with his wife in her parents' house. He has to take on the responsibility of looking after his parents-in-law during their old age, and his wife inherits the property.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-63"><a href="#cite_note-63">[63]</a></sup> Local authority was exercised by lineage elders: ‘The authority within a lineage is exercised according to age, the older member always being allowed to direct and punish the younger members. The age differences are otherwise symbolized  in only one way-the order in which rice beer is served. When beer is first passed out at a gathering, the people should be served in order of formal seniority. A maternal uncle should be served before his nephew, and an older brother before a younger one. Even an older sister may precede a younger brother, though generally men and women do not drink together. [...] In spite of this formal deference, older people do not monopolize positions of power, and an old person cannot exercise authority outside his lineage simply because of his age. One defers to one’s lineage seniors, but not to old people in general.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-64"><a href="#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup> Village headmen acted as intermediaries in local disputes: ‘Among the Garos most disputes arise over the issues of property, inheritance, and domestic quarrels within the family. Such problems are to a large extent settled by the MAHARI (lineage) of the offended and the offender. A new situation develops when someone's cattle cause damage to another's crops. Under such situation the NOKMA (village headman) acts as an intermediary only. If he fails to settle the dispute, the matter can go to the civil court of the district council.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-65"><a href="#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup>  ‘Traditionally, the  nokma’s position was connected with the indigeneous customary rites. His temporal and ritual powers in a traditional society were linked with his position. The conversion of a  nokma to Christianity automatically led to the loss of his ritualistic role. When the  nokma’s were endowed with real temporal power, the resistance was great as  Nokmas were non-Christians. But when the  Nokma accepted Christianity,  nokmaship passed to another person who could act as a  nokma in performing rites and rituals. However, the Government still recognized the converted persons as  nokmas. This created dislocation in the traditional system, one looking after the customary right and other ritual responsibilities. As the author has tried to show that in the traditional system the two roles cannot be separated, the two roles are enmeshed into each other.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-66"><a href="#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup> Nokmas also formally held titles to land: ‘In a Garo village very little difference of status is seen. A particular clan holds right of ownership of the village homestead and shifting cultivation lands, and the title of ownership is inherited by a particular household. The head of the land-owning household is known as the  nokma, and the particular area under which he holds ownership right is known as   a’king. He also acts as the religious head of the village, and he is to perform the ceremonies for the general well-being of the village. He is called upon to settle disputes between villagers. But in all his decisions he is guided by the elders of the village. He is not entitled to any tribute from the villagers, and he has no special paraphernalia to indicate himself as the  nokma. However, in the village a rich man gets respect, because in times of need people have to seek help from him. But in a Garo village it is usually very rare to find an extremely rich man. To a Garo wealth consists of a number of brass gongs called  rang and some ornaments made of silver or some such metal. Now-a-days a gun is also regarded as the status symbol of a wealthy man.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-67"><a href="#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup> While village headmen were acknowledged later by the British administration, the imposition of appointed officials led to a loss of political power among Nokmas: ‘There was a move for retention of the old institution of  nokmaship which could not function with authority since the British administration had appointed the  laskars and  sardars for the smooth running of their administration from 1824 onwards. The  nokmas became only the clan chief and custodian of the clan land  a’king. The  nokma could not administer effectively as he used to do prior to the British administration in the district. The  nokmas were supposed to be well versed with their functions and duties in the villages. The British administration enforced the Rules of Administration of Justice in the Garo Hills both Civil and Police in 1937. These rules have been renewed again and again.

</p><p>(1) Village Priest (Kamal)
</p><p>‘A Garo religious practitioner is known as KAMAL. The word is used to mean 'specialist'; thus a midwife may be a kamal. A kamal has neither special privilege nor prestige from his service to the society.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-69"><a href="#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup> The village priest or healer dealt with misfortune caused by malicious sprites: ‘These  mite live in many places. Some dwell in the village, others in the jungle, near a tree, or by a stream or waterfall. A fork in a road is a favorite place, and powerful  mite are said to live on mountain tops. All are dealt with in the same general fashion, though the details of the sacrifices differ. Several men usually spend about two hours building an altar. Most altars  are built of bamboo and leaves, but the precise form depends upon the particular spirit to whom the sacrifice is to be directed. Once the altar is built, a ritually skilled man must offer an egg, a chicken, a pig, or even a cow, depending upon the seriousness of the disease and the demands of the  mite. This priest kills the animal in a ritually prescribed manner, and smears the blood on to the altar. He recites a number of chants while standing or squatting before the altar, and usually pours a bit of rice beer on to the ground as an additional offering. At a sacrifice to cure disease, as on other occasions when animals are ceremoniously killed, the priest inspects their viscera for omens. If the proper portion of a chicken’s intestines prove to be filled, for instance, the prognosis is good; otherwise it is bad. While the priest is performing the ritual, the men who have helped build the altar sit around, chatting and joking, with no outward signs of respect or attention. There is no ecstasy and no sleight of hand, and the sick person is not even necessarily present. When the formalities are completed, the helpers prepare the animal and cook it into a curry. Rice is boiled, and all of the helpers share in the ensuing meal. Typically, the entire sacrifice, from the time the participants first assemble to the time they finish the feast, takes three or four hours. Afterward the participants go to their own houses. They are not supposed to go to their fields for the whole day, though they may do chores about the house. Sacrifices of this sort are the commonest kind of ceremony performed by the people of Rengsanggri. They involve only a half dozen or so neighbors and relatives, and they are held whenever the need arises. Occasionally two or three may even be held on the same day if several people in the village are sick. Altogether several hundred sacrifices are likely to be performed in the village of Rengsanggri in a single year.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-70"><a href="#cite_note-70">[70]</a></sup> They also officiated at village festivals: ‘Wangala is one of the three festivals at which group dancing takes place. This occurs in the courtyards in front of the houses, where people like to keep a sizable cleared space for this very purpose. Both married and unmarried people take part, though dancing is generally felt to be most appropriate for the young, especially those who are unmarried. Group dancing is almost exclusively a night pastime, and may continue intermittently until dawn.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-71"><a href="#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup> During the pre-colonial period, some missionary contact took place, but Christianization itself only accelerated after the British occupation: ‘The third major influence on the Garos, and in some ways the most important, has been that of Christianity. American Baptist missionaries began to have a few peripheral contacts with the Garos even before their hills were occupied by the British. Missionaries were stationed in Goalpara, a town on the Brahmaputra just north of the Garo Hills, and some of their work was with Garos. However, intensive Christianization began only after the occupation of the hills. American missionaries followed the government officers into the hills and like them set up their headquarters in the town of Tura, which remains the center of Garo Christian activities today. The missionaries not only evangelized, but from the beginning carried out extensive medical and educational work.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-72"><a href="#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup> Accordingly, this variable was coded for A’chik practitioners rather than Christian missionaries.

Any person who is conversant with the technicalities of magico-religious rites can perform them. However, magico-religious rites performed for the well-being of the community in general are performed by the village priest ( kamal) who is supposed to be well acquainted with the procedure of such rites. There may be several such specialists in the village. Usually after the death of the seniormost the next senior man steps in. The office of the  kamal is in no way hereditary. He does not enjoy any special privilege in the village community.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-80"><a href="#cite_note-80">[80]</a></sup> ‘There may be more than one  kamal in a village, but the major rites are performed by the oldest and the most experienced  kamal.

Often rites of propitiation for minor ailments in the household are performed by the head of the family himself. The kamal does not enjoy any privilege because of his services to the villagers. He has to cultivate his plot of shifting land just like any other villager. He also does not get any remuneration for performing the rites.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-81"><a href="#cite_note-81">[81]</a></sup> ‘The  kamal’s life has certain drawbacks, for his duties are often both onerous and unpleasant; for instance, when he has to watch by the side of the dead for long hours together, reciting tedious funeral dirges. Very little remuneration is given him, and in no way does the priest enjoy privileges which his fellow-villagers do not share. He must work in the fields and grow his crops like the rest, and the only way in which his lot is different from that of his neighbours, is that he must devote his attention to the requirements of others, even at personal inconvenience.

A colonial bureaucratic structure was superimposed onto the A’chik system of informal village and lineage leadership only after British occupation. ‘Many of the disputes of the Garos were decided in their village  Panchayats. When a man has some complaints against another he reports them to the Nokma or the village-head. If the nature of the complaints is simple, the Nokma in a meeting of the few leading persons of the village, decides the dispute; but if the nature of the complaints is complicated and not easy of solution the Nokma reports the matter to the Laskar. The Laskar is a very important and influential man in the Garo Hills District. The hills areas are divided into some elekas and each of such elekas is placed under a Laskar for convenient collection of the house tax as well as for deciding the disputes of small nature locally. The Laskar need not essentially be a literate man, worldly prudence is enough for the management of his eleka. In practice a Laskar wields immense influence in his eleka.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-83"><a href="#cite_note-83">[83]</a></sup> The office of loskor was introduced even before occupation, but became fully formalized only after that: ‘The  loskor has several duties. He collects the house tax within his district, keeping a fixed portion of this as his own payment, and he organizes work parties to keep the roads open. His most important duty, however, is to supervise and try to settle legal disputes. The  loskor sometimes appoints one or more assistants called  sordars, to whom the District Council pays an annual stipend of 100 Rupees, together with a shirt and a pair of short pants. Saljing, who lived in Rengsanggri, was a  sordar; but not every village had one, and a  sordar does not have jurisdiction over a particular village. As a general assistant to the  loskor he may assist in collecting information about a dispute, and in petty matters a  sordar may sit as representative of the  loskor and preside at a trial. The  loskorship demands a large part of a man’s time, but a  sordar spends most of his time working in his fields like his neighbors.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-84"><a href="#cite_note-84">[84]</a></sup> The British administration interfered with the Zamindar system. ‘During the first few years of the British rule in Assam the district of Garo Hills was treated as a part of the Goalpara district. The whole tract was placed under a Civil Commissioner. This officer took into his hands the collection of rents claimed by the Zaminders from the Garos, and abolished the duties levied by them on the hill producers. For some years a policy of  non-interference was followed but without the desired success; so it was decided to appoint an officer-in-charge of the hills and in 1869 a.d. the Garo Hills were formed into a separate district with Tura as its headquarters. It is said in some parts of the district even now that the British administrators had to get away with many of the influential chiefs and other men of the tribe by killing them for, they could not easily bow down to the foreigners. Once this hills area was completely brought under the control of the government, the Garos lived peacefully.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-85"><a href="#cite_note-85">[85]</a></sup> The Zamindars were aristocrats from neighbouring territories attempting to collect taxes from the local population, and therefore should not be considered bureaucrats. The precise structure of the Zamindar system and its geographical extent in the Garo Hills remains to be confirmed. 'Zamindar, in India, a holder or occupier (dār) of land (zamīn). The root words are Persian, and the resulting name was widely used wherever Persian influence was spread by the Mughals or other Indian Muslim dynasties. The meanings attached to it were various. In Bengal the word denoted a hereditary tax collector who could retain 10 percent of the revenue he collected. In the late 18th century the British government made these zamindars landowners, thus creating a landed aristocracy in Bengal and Bihar that lasted until Indian independence (1947). In parts of north India (e.g., Uttar Pradesh), a zamindar denoted a large landowner with full proprietary rights. More generally in north India, zamindar denoted the cultivator of the soil or joint proprietors holding village lands in common as joint heirs. In Maratha territories the name was generally applied to all local hereditary revenue officers.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-86"><a href="#cite_note-86">[86]</a></sup> ‘There remains no record of when the Garos migrated and settled in their present habitat.

After settling in the hills, Garos initially had no close and constant contact with the inhabitants of the adjoining plains.

Wet cultivation was only expanded in the post-independence period. ‘Hill farmers seem to have had little opposition to the clearing of some land for wet rice, even though this has meant that it could no longer be used for dry cultivation. In most villages the areas in which wet cultivation is possible are more or less limited, it never yet having occurred to a Garo that hillsides  might be terraced; and the threat of alienation of the land has not yet seemed particularly serious. Strangers, and sometimes even non-Garos, have been allowed to settle and clear new land. At the present time the laws passed by the Garo Hills District Council in an effort to encourage wet rice cultivation provide that if local villagers do not take advantage of suitable land, others will have the right to convert it to paddy fields. In some cases new settlers have probably paid the  nokma or even the  a’king owners (title-holders) a fee to permit its use and alienation. Some might interpret this as  a’wil, the fee that is traditionally paid to the  a’king owner by non-villagers who wish to use dry fields, though ordinarily  a’wil confers only a temporary right. Others might interpret it as purchase price for the land; or, finally, it might be considered a bribe, since no such purchase is recognized as legal by the government. However regarded, such a fee might help to smooth over any antagonism toward the new arrival, though in practice it appears that the villagers have often failed to appreciate the value of potential paddy land and have let it go with little or no opposition.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-116"><a href="#cite_note-116">[116]</a></sup> The code reflects dry rather than wet cultivation.</dd>
<dd><b> ♠ drinking water supply systems ♣ absent ♥ </b> Villages relied on natural water sources: ‘Unlike other hill tribes, such as the Nagas and the Lushais, who build their villages high up on the slopes of hills, the Garos construct theirs in valleys or in depressions on the hillsides, close to running water. They attach great importance to pure water, and it is quite the exception for them to live at any distance from a good stream. The sites chosen for the houses are nevertheless generally steep, and the villages are rarely on flat ground.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-117"><a href="#cite_note-117">[117]</a></sup> Access to rivers was an important factor when choosing a site for a new village even in the post-independence period: ‘There are different sizes of village in the Garo Hills. I have seen small villages consisting of two or three huts, practically isolated from all the advantages of a big village. On the other hand, in a big village there may be as many as fifty or more huts. The size of the big village entirely depends on the space that is available for the house building and also the facilities the inhabitants of the village may derive for cultivation and other purposes from the surroundings of the locality. The largest village, I visited, was situated on the slopes of the hills, as is the usual practice, facing long strip of valley, nearly about a mile and a half long and about half a mile broad. It is easily understandable that people living in such villages take to plough and utilise the valley for agricultural purposes. It has, therefore, the advantage of accommodating larger people than it is possible for the village which is situated on the hill slopes and which is to depend primarily on  jhum cultivation as described hereafter. Usually, an average sized village contains ten to fifteen houses. The economic factor is one of the main guiding principles regarding the expansion of a village. Availability of arrable land or hillocks for jhum cultivation, good drinking water, facilities of conveyance and also facilities of market places are some of the main factors, which the Garos consider before they fix up a place to start a new village. The common practice is to have one house for one family consisting of husband, wife, and children. Occasionally, the old mother or the mother-in-law also stays in the family.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-118"><a href="#cite_note-118">[118]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b> ♠ markets ♣ inferred absent ♥ </b> According to Marak, plains markets were frequented by the A’chik even when raiding was still practiced: ‘They visited markets at bordering plains with their produce from the hills like raw cotton, chillies, ginger, wax, rubber, lac and other things to barter for essential items such as salt, dried fish and jewellery of all kinds and most important metal implements and weapons which they needed so desperately. In other words, to generate surplus they needed slaves. To get slaves they had to attack the plains or neighbouring villages. To win and capture slaves they needed to be strong and alert. Obviously in a situation like this economic strength promoted the physical strength.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-119"><a href="#cite_note-119">[119]</a></sup> Were these markets permanent structures or open fields where stalls could be set up, ad hoc?

<dd><b> ♠ food storage sites ♣ absent ♥ </b> Village granaries were built in one place, but individual granaries were owned by households rather than the community: ‘In one corner of the village, or if it is a very large one, in two or three places outside the ring of living-houses, there is always a collection of smaller huts, which, from their size and appearance, are clearly not intended for human habitation. These are the village granaries, of which each family possesses one or more. The custom of building all the granaries in one place no doubt has its origin in the fact that the grain is thus in less danger of fire than if it were stored in the living houses. In many parts of the hills the grain is protected from the inroads of rats and other vermin by laying the floors of the granaries on posts, the tops of which are carved in the shape of a mushroom, so as to give the animals the least possible foothold.  The practice of placing these granaries at a distance from other houses has, however, its drawbacks, for it is no rare thing for an elephant to come round at night, and finding unguarded houses full of his favourite food, to pull one down and help himself to the contents. In these granaries the paddy is placed in a large basket made of strips of bamboo, which takes up nearly the whole of the floor space. Bunches of Indian corn and millet are often suspended from the roof, and various roots occupy the remaining space on the floor.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-120"><a href="#cite_note-120">[120]</a></sup></dd></dl>

The comparison is of great with small, for the Dimapur stones are of immense size, while the k˘imas are but wooden posts. Still, the resemblance certainly exists, and the fact that k˘imas are always carved to the same pattern (except when they represent a human face) tends to prove that the carving is done on some definite principle, handed down perhaps from one generation to another, the origin of which has long been lost. When we consider further the small number of the monoliths, it is not improbable that they were erected to commemorate a chief or person [Page 17] of high degree, while the ordinary person had nothing better erected in his memory than the k˘imas which are set up in every Garo village.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-124"><a href="#cite_note-124">[124]</a></sup> Ceremonial gifts served to 'record' obligations between families: 'Kokam is a payment given to those who slaughter a cow in honor of the deceased. Slaughtering may be done by a son, but also by a more distant relative, whether a member of the same lineage or not, and it is frequently done by the man who leads a party from another village to attend a funeral. Killing a cow brings honor both to the deceased and to the man who organizes the killing, and the occasion provides a fine meal to the friends and relatives who help. The organizer receives the kokam from the household of the dead man, and like magual this is most appropriately a brass heirloom gong, though something else may be substituted if no gongs are available. The gong is carried back to the organizer’s village, where the cow is killed and a slender wooden post erected to advertise the event. The gong thus acquired can be used for nothing other than to be returned to the original family when somebody in the acquiring family dies. At that time the original family must sacrifice a cow in return. In other words, the kokam gifts form a symbolic record of the obligations that are set up for returning the honor of killing a [Page 200] cow, and in this way households bestow honor upon one another. One man may be followed in death by several cows.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-125"><a href="#cite_note-125">[125]</a></sup> But are symbolic buildings or moveable objects mnemonic devices?

The grip is very thin, and instead of being straight, is curved, and ends in a flat, sharp-edged, rounded head. This sharp hilt is supposed to enable the owner to stick his sword into the ground by his side when he halts, so as to have it always ready to his hand. At each end of the crossbar is attached a bunch of cow’s-tail hair, or what is more greatly prized, part of a yak’s tail. The sword is always carried naked, and is never placed in a sheath or fastened to the body. It is a most useful possession to the Garo on the    march, for with it he can clear jungle which bars his way, split firewood and cut up his food, besides using it for the mainpurpose of defence. These swords are purchased from the Megams in the Khasi Hills district, and appear to be of Khasi origin.

The heads are first cemented into their sockets with lac, and then very neatly bound to them with thin withes of cane, which further servo the purpose of preventing the shaft from splitting. With these spears two or three men will attack a bear, and even tigers are occasionally killed with them. In the big drives for game which the Garos sometimes organize, spears are invariably used, and numbers of pig are slaughtered with these weapons.

It appears that they do not grudge it even though they cross very high hills.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-166"><a href="#cite_note-166">[166]</a></sup>  ‘“The villages were irregular, hidden in hollows of the hills or on clinging spurs surrounded by jungle covered heights. They were so covered by bamboos and tall trees and as such houses  could not be easily located except through the sound or clamour coming from the bottom of the gorge. The paths were zigzag across the peaks or descend through the craggy sharp hillsides. They were susceptible to regular animal depredation - wild elephants, tigers, etc.” which remain as a scourge in many Garo villages even today.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-167"><a href="#cite_note-167">[167]</a></sup>  ‘Unlike other hill tribes, such as the Nagas and the Lushais, who build their villages high up on the slopes of hills, the Garos construct theirs in valleys or in depressions on the hillsides, close to running water. They attach great importance to pure water, and it is quite the exception for them to live at any distance from a good stream. The sites chosen for the houses are nevertheless generally steep, and the villages are rarely on flat ground.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-168"><a href="#cite_note-168">[168]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b> ♠ Wooden palisades ♣ present ♥ </b> ‘Besides the sacrifices for individual cases of illness, there are certain ceremonies which are observed once a year by a whole community or village, and are intended to safeguard its members from dangers of the forest, and from sickness and mishap during the coming twelve months. The principal of these is the Asongtata ceremony. Close to the outskirts of every big village a number of stones may be noticed stuck into the ground, apparently without order or method. These are known by the name of  asong, and on them is offered the sacrifice which the Asougtata demands. The sacrifice of a goat takes place, and a month later, that of a  langur ( Entcllus monkey), or a bamboo-rat is considered necessary. The animal chosen has a rope fastened round its neck and is led by two men, one on each side of it, to every house in the village. It is taken inside each house in turn, the assembled villagers, meanwhile, beating the walls from the outside, to frighten and drive out any evil spirits which may have taken up their residence within. The round of the village having been made in this manner, the monkey or rat is led to the outskirts of the village, killed by a blow of a  duo, which disembowels it, and then crucified on bamboos set up in the ground. Round the crucified animal long, sharp bamboo stakes are placed, which form  chcvaux de frisc round about it. Those commemorate the days when such defences surrounded the villages on all sides to keep off human enemies, and they are now a symbol to ward off sickness and dangers to life from the wild animals of the forest. The  langur required for the purpose is hunted down some days before, but should it be found impossible to catch one, a brown monkey may take its place; a hulock may not be used.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-169"><a href="#cite_note-169">[169]</a></sup> ‘In former days, Garo villages were of considerable size and used to contain as many as two or three hundred houses. Liability to attack by a neighbouring village made this necessary, and the danger was further guarded against by sowing the approaches with sharp-pointed bamboo stakes called  wamisi in Garo, but better known as  panjis. These presented a very formidable obstacle to an enemy, and effectually prevented a sudden attack. Nowadays, when every man is at peace with his neighbour, the necessity no longer exists for large collections of houses, and the difficulty of finding sufficient land close to big villages for the support of their inhabitants, has resulted in their being broken up into small hamlets situated perhaps as much as four or five miles apart, which, however, in most cases, retain the name of the parent village. In order to distinguish them there is added to the name of each hamlet the name of its  nokma, or headman.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-170"><a href="#cite_note-170">[170]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ elite status is hereditary ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> There was no elite in the strict sense of the term. <i>If there is no elite there can be no elite status.</i> 'Property among the Garos is inherited in the female line. One of the daughters is selected by the parents to be the heiress. If the couple have no female child, a girl belonging to the machong of the wife (preferably the daughter of her sister, whether real or classificatory) is adopted to be an heiress. She is not considered to be the absolute owner of the property. Decision about the disposal of property is taken by her husband, who is considered to be the household authority (NOKNI SKOTONG).

When an older member of a household dies, the Garos view his heir as stepping into the social position of the dead person-a woman into the position of her mother and a man into the position of his ‘uncle’ and father-in-law. The clearest symbolic expression of this is the assumption by the heir of kinship terms formerly appropriate to his father-in-law.

<p><b>♠ Rulers are legitimated by gods ♣ absent ♥</b> Village headmen acted as intermediaries in local disputes: ‘Among the Garos most disputes arise over the issues of property, inheritance, and domestic quarrels within the family. Such problems are to a large extent settled by the MAHARI (lineage) of the offended and the offender. A new situation develops when someone's cattle cause damage to another's crops. Under such situation the NOKMA (village headman) acts as an intermediary only. If he fails to settle the dispute, the matter can go to the civil court of the district council.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-173"><a href="#cite_note-173">[173]</a></sup> Nokmas also formally held titles to land: 'Perhaps the most important single characteristic of a nokma is the possession of titles to land. The land which surrounds a village is divided into numerous patches, and titles to these patches are typically distributed among a few of the richest households of the village, including those of the nokmas. A plot of land to which a man holds title is known as a’king, and a nokma who holds a title is known as an a’king nokma. Titles to a’king can be bought and sold among members of the village; [Page 226] however, at the present time sale is unusual, and land titles often stay in the same family for generations, always being inherited intact by the heir and heiress of the last title-holders. Prices in the past have varied from 25 to 75 rupees for the amount of land suitable for one family’s cultivation; on the other hand, titles even today are sometimes purchased with brass gongs instead of money.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-174"><a href="#cite_note-174">[174]</a></sup> 'Holding a title brings almost no direct benefit, for the titleholder has no more right to use the land than anyone else in the village. Nevertheless it confers great prestige, and titles like, heirlooms and jewelry, can be an important repository of savings. They can be converted into other forms of wealth and used to tide the household over poor years, as well as to give stability to its position of wealth in the village. Titles are considered even safer than ownership of heirlooms, since heirlooms can be stolen or destroyed. Moreover, title to some land is a necessary prerequisite for being considered a nokma, though land title alone is not enough. Four men in Rengsanggri had title to some land: Gajang, Jengnon, Nanggan, and Bano; but the first two of these held the most, and only they were considered nokmas. Bano was not a wealthy man, though the household he inherited had formerly been much wealthier. He performed no ceremonies appropriate to nokmaship, and people suggested that he might soon be forced to sell some of his land titles. Nanggan was much richer. He held title to more land than Bano, but still not as much as either Jengnon or Gajang. Nanggan did not perform the ceremonies of a nokma or possess any of the symbols of one; but the main obstacle to his being considered a nokma was that his household had such little genealogical depth. Nanggan purchased some of his title from one Rojang, who was from a family that had formerly been very wealthy, but who was gradually forced to sell some of his land to fellow villagers, and eventually moved away from Rengsanggri. Nanggan himself was an heir, but his father-in-law had been a non-heir who had married a girl from what is now Jengnon’s household and lived [Page 227] separately. In another generation or two, if Nanggan’s heir and his heir’s heir continue to maintain the wealth of the household, they will be obvious candidates for nokmaship, and may assume the symbols and obligations of the office.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-175"><a href="#cite_note-175">[175]</a></sup> However, there was little status differentiation overall: ‘In a Garo village very little difference of status is seen. A particular clan holds right of ownership of the village homestead and shifting cultivation lands, and the title of ownership is inherited by a particular household. The head of the land-owning household is known as the  nokma, and the particular area under which he holds ownership right is known as   a’king. He also acts as the religious head of the village, and he is to perform the ceremonies for the general well-being of the village. He is called upon to settle disputes between villagers. But in all his decisions he is guided by the elders of the village. He is not entitled to any tribute from the villagers, and he has no special paraphernalia to indicate himself as the  nokma. However, in the village a rich man gets respect, because in times of need people have to seek help from him. But in a Garo village it is usually very rare to find an extremely rich man. To a Garo wealth consists of a number of brass gongs called  rang and some ornaments made of silver or some such metal. Now-a-days a gun is also regarded as the status symbol of a wealthy man.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-176"><a href="#cite_note-176">[176]</a></sup> People admire the rich men, but they do not defer to them in any formal manner, and an observer could not possibly tell from watching a group of men in ordinary daily pursuits which of them were rich and which poor. If one looked at the size of their houses or measured the size of their fields, however, the relative position of the men would become fairly clear, and the more one observed the details of personal relations, the clearer it would become. Village life is so organized that few important village-wide decisions must be made, but when problems do arise people are usually willing to go along with the decisions of [Page 208] the elite. The nokma must formally designate the day for ceremonies, but before doing so he informally samples the opinions of other wealthy men. If disagreements arise about the distribution of plots for cultivation, the wealthy men can usually carry along public opinion toward some solution. I once watched villagers buying a cow for a ceremony. Every household had contributed money toward the price of the cow, but it was four or five wealthy men who put their heads together and decided whether or not to try to make the seller come down in price. These are not profound questions; but somebody must decide them, and most villagers are happy to leave them to the wealthy men. After all, they “feed” the poorer people, and their very wealth is evidence of their ability. My own judgment of the ability of the various men in the village was close to the consensus of the villagers. I agreed with them that the wealthy people were often more able and intelligent than the others. It does take more than ordinary ability to accumulate or hold on to wealth.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-177"><a href="#cite_note-177">[177]</a></sup> Headmen were typically husbands of heiresses from senior households (see also material on equity and social mobility above): 'I have referred in a number of places to ‘headmanship,’ and it is at last possible to explain the nature, duties, and privileges of a ‘headman.’ In any village at least one man-and often two, three, or occasionally even more-is referred to by the term nokma, which is generally-though badly-translated as ‘headman.’ These nokmas wear no symbol of their position which would permit a stranger to recognize them, but any villager can name and point out the individuals in his village who rate this title.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-178"><a href="#cite_note-178">[178]</a></sup> 'To explain how a man becomes nokma, it is first necessary to refer once more to the lineage structure of the village. It is simplest to consider villages with a single main lineage first. Just as one household of each cooperating group is considered to be senior by virtue of the fact that all the other households have “come out” from it, one household is the most senior of the whole village, since all of the houses ultimately “came out” from it. The process may, of course, have involved many stages, but the senior household is ordinarily considered to be that of the first nokma. Normally the nokma, like any other man, looks for a ‘nephew,’ that is, a younger man from his own lineage, to come and be his son-in-law and heir. In this case, the ‘nephew’ not only becomes the heir to the house and property but also [Page 224] succeeds to the ‘headmanship’ when his father-in-law dies. Inevitably the nokmas of many villages have grown up in a different village, and belong to a different sib and to the opposite moiety from the people of the main village lineage. A nokma should, however, be a member of the same lineage and from the same village as the previous nokma, so generally a succession of ‘headmen’ are members of one village and lineage by descent but hold the status of ‘headman’ in another village by virtue of being married to the women who are successively chosen as heiress in the senior house of the village.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-179"><a href="#cite_note-179">[179]</a></sup> 'The ‘headmanship’ is thought of as adhering more closely to the house than to any individual person. All the symbols of office go with the house and not with the man. The most important of the symbols is a particular kind of drum so heavily endowed with supernatural power that no one else in the village dares to keep it in his house. It is not necessarily dangerous to use, for at village festivals the drum is carried from house to house and then anybody may beat it. Funeral parties will even carry it to another village if they should go to pay condolences after a death in that village, but it can only be kept permanently in the nokma’s house. The house itself is constructed with specially carved posts which are flattened on two sides instead of being left round as in all other houses; and when a house of a nokma is thatched, special little straw animals decorate the roof. Even the term nokma is etymologically related to that for ‘house’ or ‘household’-i.e. nok; while - ma is a suffix which in some contexts means ‘big’ or ‘large’; thus nokma literally means the ‘big house,’ though it is used to refer to the man of that house.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-180"><a href="#cite_note-180">[180]</a></sup> There could be more than on Nokma: 'It has already been pointed out that a single village often has more than one nokma. If so, one of them is always considered to be the “first” nokma and the others are considered to be secondary to him. The ranking of nokmas may conceivably have been encouraged by the government’s custom of recording only a single nokma’s name for certain official purposes. But while in some doubtful cases two nokmas of about equal stature may have been [Page 225] given inequality in this way, it seems more likely that the inequality of nokmas and the requirement that one be considered senior has been inherent in Garo social organization and is not simply a response to foreign rule. If two lineages are found in the same village, each always has its own nokma, the man of its senior house. Since the nokmaship is acquired by marrying into a lineage, the nokma can never belong to the lineage of which he is nokma. So in Songmagri, where there are two lineages, the first nokma is the Chambigong nokma and is himself a Manda Sangma, but like his father-in-law he comes from another village. The Manda nokma, on the other hand, is a Chambigong of the Songmagri lineage of Chambigong. Even if a nokma comes from the opposite lineage of a two-lineage village, he is nokma only because of his marriage and never simply because of his own lineage affiliation.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-181"><a href="#cite_note-181">[181]</a></sup> 'Even villages with only one lineage may have two or more nokmas. In Rengsanggri the second nokma is Jengnon, who is himself an Agidok from Waramgri, as were his father-in-law and his grandfather-in-law before him. He is married to the woman who is heiress in the house that is considered the second oldest in the village. Jengnon is explicitly considered a nokma, but he is unquestionably second to Gajang, the first nokma, who is himself a Manda from Songmagri. Jengnon’s house does not happen to have all the symbols of nokmaship, such as the specially carved house posts or the special drum, though in other villages more than one house is sometimes equipped with these things.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-182"><a href="#cite_note-182">[182]</a></sup> Nokmas traditionally had a number of ritual duties: 'Traditionally, the Garos were not a politically organized society, and even today there exists no clear-cut political structure. Chieftainship involves religious functions only.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-183"><a href="#cite_note-183">[183]</a></sup> ‘Traditionally, the  nokma’s position was connected with the indigeneous customary rites. His temporal and ritual powers in a traditional society were linked with his position. The conversion of a  nokma to Christianity automatically led to the loss of his ritualistic role. When the  nokma’s were endowed with real temporal power, the resistance was great as  Nokmas were non-Christians. But when the  Nokma accepted Christianity,  nokmaship passed to another person who could act as a  nokma in performing rites and rituals. However, the Government still recognized the converted persons as  nokmas. This created dislocation in the traditional system, one looking after the customary right and other ritual responsibilities. As the author has tried to show that in the traditional system the two roles cannot be separated, the two roles are enmeshed into each other.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-184"><a href="#cite_note-184">[184]</a></sup> Accordingly, there was a connection between the roles of Nokma and Kamal: ‘A Garo religious practitioner is known as KAMAL. The word is used to mean 'specialist'; thus a midwife may be a kamal. A kamal has neither special privilege nor prestige from his service to the society.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-185"><a href="#cite_note-185">[185]</a></sup> The village priest or healer dealt with misfortune caused by malicious sprites: ‘These  mite live in many places. Some dwell in the village, others in the jungle, near a tree, or by a stream or waterfall. A fork in a road is a favorite place, and powerful  mite are said to live on mountain tops. All are dealt with in the same general fashion, though the details of the sacrifices differ. Several men usually spend about two hours building an altar. Most altars  are built of bamboo and leaves, but the precise form depends upon the particular spirit to whom the sacrifice is to be directed. Once the altar is built, a ritually skilled man must offer an egg, a chicken, a pig, or even a cow, depending upon the seriousness of the disease and the demands of the  mite. This priest kills the animal in a ritually prescribed manner, and smears the blood on to the altar. He recites a number of chants while standing or squatting before the altar, and usually pours a bit of rice beer on to the ground as an additional offering. At a sacrifice to cure disease, as on other occasions when animals are ceremoniously killed, the priest inspects their viscera for omens. If the proper portion of a chicken’s intestines prove to be filled, for instance, the prognosis is good; otherwise it is bad. While the priest is performing the ritual, the men who have helped build the altar sit around, chatting and joking, with no outward signs of respect or attention. There is no ecstasy and no sleight of hand, and the sick person is not even necessarily present. When the formalities are completed, the helpers prepare the animal and cook it into a curry. Rice is boiled, and all of the helpers share in the ensuing meal. Typically, the entire sacrifice, from the time the participants first assemble to the time they finish the feast, takes three or four hours. Afterward the participants go to their own houses. They are not supposed to go to their fields for the whole day, though they may do chores about the house. Sacrifices of this sort are the commonest kind of ceremony performed by the people of Rengsanggri. They involve only a half dozen or so neighbors and relatives, and they are held whenever the need arises. Occasionally two or three may even be held on the same day if several people in the village are sick. Altogether several hundred sacrifices are likely to be performed in the village of Rengsanggri in a single year.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-186"><a href="#cite_note-186">[186]</a></sup> They also officiated at village festivals: ‘Wangala is one of the three festivals at which group dancing takes place. This occurs in the courtyards in front of the houses, where people like to keep a sizable cleared space for this very purpose. Both married and unmarried people take part, though dancing is generally felt to be most appropriate for the young, especially those who are unmarried. Group dancing is almost exclusively a night pastime, and may continue intermittently until dawn.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-187"><a href="#cite_note-187">[187]</a></sup> During the pre-colonial period, some missionary contact took place, but Christianization itself only accelerated after the British occupation: ‘The third major influence on the Garos, and in some ways the most important, has been that of Christianity. American Baptist missionaries began to have a few peripheral contacts with the Garos even before their hills were occupied by the British. Missionaries were stationed in Goalpara, a town on the Brahmaputra just north of the Garo Hills, and some of their work was with Garos. However, intensive Christianization began only after the occupation of the hills. American missionaries followed the government officers into the hills and like them set up their headquarters in the town of Tura, which remains the center of Garo Christian activities today. The missionaries not only evangelized, but from the beginning carried out extensive medical and educational work.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-188"><a href="#cite_note-188">[188]</a></sup> Despite the ritual aspects of a Nokma's duties, we have found no evidence of headmen being directly legitimated by spirits. This is open to review.

<p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of equality ♣ present ♥</b> The A’chik were stratified along the lines of clan, matrilineage, and moiety membership rather than social class: 'In Garo society the most important social group is the clan known as MACHONG. A machong is an exogamous matrilineal descent group wherein a Garo is automatically assigned by birth to the unilineal group of his mother. A CHATCHI (moiety) is divided into many machong. Each married couple chooses one daughter--or, if they have none, they adopt a close relative of the mother--to be heiress (NAKNA DONQIPIKA MECHIK) of the family. Her husband traditionally is selected from the lineage group of the father and is accepted as the NOKROM of the house. He resides with his wife in her parents' house. He has to take on the responsibility of looking after his parents-in-law during their old age, and his wife inherits the property.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-189"><a href="#cite_note-189">[189]</a></sup> 'The Garos reckon their kinship through the mother. Individuals measure the degree of their relationship to one another by the distance of their matrilineages. For men, children of their sister or sister's daughters are very important kin. For women, children of their sister's daughters are equivalent to the children of their own daughters.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-190"><a href="#cite_note-190">[190]</a></sup> 'Land for shifting cultivation is owned by the clan. Each village has a traditionally demarcated area of its own termed ADOK. This area is subdivided into plots that are used for cultivation in a cyclic order. The plots are distributed to the families. Allotment of the general plots is done by common consensus of the village elders. But the flat area for permanent wet cultivation is owned by individuals.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-191"><a href="#cite_note-191">[191]</a></sup> 'Property among the Garos is inherited in the female line. One of the daughters is selected by the parents to be the heiress.

If a dead man is survived by a widow, she stays in the family of her daughter and is sometimes referred to as an additional wife (JIK) of her daughter's husband.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-192"><a href="#cite_note-192">[192]</a></sup> Lineage heiresses and their husbands played a special role: 'Besides objects and wealth, social status is also inherited by the heir and heiress. When an older member of a household dies, the Garos view his heir as stepping into the social position of the dead person-a woman into the position of her mother and a man into the position of his ‘uncle’ and father-in-law. The clearest symbolic expression of this is the assumption by the heir of kinship terms formerly appropriate to his father-in-law. After the old man’s death, other sons-in-law call the heir by the term which is more generally used for “father-in-law,” and are in turn called “son-in-law” by the heir. It has been pointed out that Garos also speak as if the son-in-law inherited his mother-in-law when her husband dies, since after this she is regarded as a ‘wife’ of the younger man. Moreover, the wife’s siblings call him by a term that otherwise means father’s younger brother. This terminology is analyzed more fully in Appendix C. Beyond this somewhat superficial terminological matter, the occupants of the family house are considered to be the living incumbents in the role of man and woman of that particular house. Households continue, though their members come and go. The most striking example of this is the title of nokma or ‘headman’ which, as will be explained in Chapter IX, adheres to the senior household of the village. The man who happens to be married to the heiress of that household is considered to be the ‘headman’ of the village.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-193"><a href="#cite_note-193">[193]</a></sup> Prestige could be acquired through hospitality: 'A’jak and dena seem to be weighted in a lop-sided manner to the advantage of the rich members of the community, but the wealth they bring has only limited uses. Wealthy people can buy a few better clothes, eat a little more meat, command larger work parties, and therefore build bigger houses; but all this does not set them off in any sharp way from the poorer people. Rich people spend most of their time working in the fields like everyone else. The main use of wealth is to entertain on a comparatively lavish scale. This converts wealth into prestige and power, while materially the wealth is again distributed throughout the community, since everyone shares in the consumption of the goods that rich men accumulate. Feasts are not given in the Rengsanggri area on occasions designed specifically to validate or establish prestige, though such feasts do occur in some parts of the hills. The Rengsanggri custom is for ambitious men to seize as times for particularly lavish entertainment those numerous occasions when hospitality is appropriate. During the ceremonies, when the villagers are entertained in every house in turn, the richer houses entertain abundantly. The poorest houses seldom fail to offer something; but fewer people visit them, partly to avoid embarassing the householders and partly because there is less expectation of a bountiful spread. It is hardly reasonable for any single person to visit every one of the sixty households in the village, but most do assemble at the richer houses, where they can confidently expect to be greeted with copious amounts of rice beer and liberal quantities of rice and curry.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-194"><a href="#cite_note-194">[194]</a></sup> 'Entertaining is appropriate on many other occasions. When a death occurs in the community, the wealthy villagers invite others in for a consolation drink. A few relatives may kill a cow, which they say they do to honor the dead person, but which actually brings as much honor to the man who offers the cow. At the post-funeral ceremony the dead man’s household has the opportunity to kill a cow and entertain. Beer and sometimes food are distributed by participants in legal disputes. Lunch may be served to house-builders, while thatchers in particular are supposed to be rewarded with food and beer. A few households offer feasts to others out in the fields at the Asiroka ceremony, before rice planting. Even the sacrifices to banish disease may be more liberal if the family is wealthy, and thus may provide a larger feast for the helpers. A son or a daughter who has moved away from his or her parents to marry, and who is wealthy enough, may slaughter a cow, ostensibly to honor the parents. Usually the time of one of the major village festivals is chosen for this, and most of the animal is sent to the parents’ home. One leg is retained by the son’s or daughter’s family, however, and there is meat enough for two feasts, one at each house. The feast is described as one of giving thanks to the parents for their help to the child, but honor comes not only to the parents but to the child as well. The greatest hospitality and greatest prestige derive from killing a cow, and a record of the number killed is made public by decorating the front of the killer’s house with the horns and frontal bones of the animals. Wealthy houses may be hung with two or three dozen sets.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-195"><a href="#cite_note-195">[195]</a></sup> Ceremonial gongs were also important: 'One of these feasts may serve simultaneously to validate the right of a household to use its own gongs for beating at village festivals. A house must have about fifteen gongs before it is considered decent to use them, and houses which do not own enough must borrow them from a richer neighbor when they are needed. But just to accumulate and own enough gongs is not sufficient; the household must kill a cow for some occasion, such [Page 205] as to honor a parent, before the gongs can be used. After this the household will be expected to entertain regularly and on a larger than average scale, and so to maintain its prestigeful position. In Rengsanggri eight households owned enough gongs to be used in festivals: those of Gajang, Jengnon, Nanggan, Anat, Kakan, Chondu, Rongsin, and Gurang. Many other households had a few gongs but used those from one of these eight households and carried them to their houses when it was their turn to entertain during village festivals. Feasts are frequent enough for poor people to eat significantly better than they would if they relied entirely on their own gardens. Wealth differences lead to greater differences in prestige than in standards of consumption. Prestige and social standing go to the industrious and skillful.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-196"><a href="#cite_note-196">[196]</a></sup> Wealthy men tended to be more influential than poor ones: 'People admire the rich men, but they do not defer to them in any formal manner, and an observer could not possibly tell from watching a group of men in ordinary daily pursuits which of them were rich and which poor. If one looked at the size of their houses or measured the size of their fields, however, the relative position of the men would become fairly clear, and the more one observed the details of personal relations, the clearer it would become.

A machong is an exogamous matrilineal descent group wherein a Garo is automatically assigned by birth to the unilineal group of his mother. A CHATCHI (moiety) is divided into many machong. Each married couple chooses one daughter--or, if they have none, they adopt a close relative of the mother--to be heiress (NAKNA DONQIPIKA MECHIK) of the family. Her husband traditionally is selected from the lineage group of the father and is accepted as the NOKROM of the house. He resides with his wife in her parents' house. He has to take on the responsibility of looking after his parents-in-law during their old age, and his wife inherits the property.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-199"><a href="#cite_note-199">[199]</a></sup> Local authority was exercised by lineage elders: ‘The authority within a lineage is exercised according to age, the older member always being allowed to direct and punish the younger members. The age differences are otherwise symbolized  in only one way-the order in which rice beer is served. When beer is first passed out at a gathering, the people should be served in order of formal seniority. A maternal uncle should be served before his nephew, and an older brother before a younger one. Even an older sister may precede a younger brother, though generally men and women do not drink together. [...] In spite of this formal deference, older people do not monopolize positions of power, and an old person cannot exercise authority outside his lineage simply because of his age. One defers to one’s lineage seniors, but not to old people in general.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-200"><a href="#cite_note-200">[200]</a></sup> Headmanship was attached to senior households: 'The ‘headmanship’ is thought of as adhering more closely to the house than to any individual person. All the symbols of office go with the house and not with the man. The most important of the symbols is a particular kind of drum so heavily endowed with supernatural power that no one else in the village dares to keep it in his house. It is not necessarily dangerous to use, for at village festivals the drum is carried from house to house and then anybody may beat it. Funeral parties will even carry it to another village if they should go to pay condolences after a death in that village, but it can only be kept permanently in the nokma’s house. The house itself is constructed with specially carved posts which are flattened on two sides instead of being left round as in all other houses; and when a house of a nokma is thatched, special little straw animals decorate the roof. Even the term nokma is etymologically related to that for ‘house’ or ‘household’-i.e. nok; while - ma is a suffix which in some contexts means ‘big’ or ‘large’; thus nokma literally means the ‘big house,’ though it is used to refer to the man of that house.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-201"><a href="#cite_note-201">[201]</a></sup> Heads of senior households, i.e. the husbands of lineage heiresses, typically acted as village headmen: 'I have referred in a number of places to ‘headmanship,’ and it is at last possible to explain the nature, duties, and privileges of a ‘headman.’ In any village at least one man-and often two, three, or occasionally even more-is referred to by the term nokma, which is generally-though badly-translated as ‘headman.’ These nokmas wear no symbol of their position which would permit a stranger to recognize them, but any villager can name and point out the individuals in his village who rate this title.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-202"><a href="#cite_note-202">[202]</a></sup> 'To explain how a man becomes nokma, it is first necessary to refer once more to the lineage structure of the village. It is simplest to consider villages with a single main lineage first. Just as one household of each cooperating group is considered to be senior by virtue of the fact that all the other households have “come out” from it, one household is the most senior of the whole village, since all of the houses ultimately “came out” from it. The process may, of course, have involved many stages, but the senior household is ordinarily considered to be that of the first nokma. Normally the nokma, like any other man, looks for a ‘nephew,’ that is, a younger man from his own lineage, to come and be his son-in-law and heir. In this case, the ‘nephew’ not only becomes the heir to the house and property but also [Page 224] succeeds to the ‘headmanship’ when his father-in-law dies. Inevitably the nokmas of many villages have grown up in a different village, and belong to a different sib and to the opposite moiety from the people of the main village lineage. A nokma should, however, be a member of the same lineage and from the same village as the previous nokma, so generally a succession of ‘headmen’ are members of one village and lineage by descent but hold the status of ‘headman’ in another village by virtue of being married to the women who are successively chosen as heiress in the senior house of the village.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-203"><a href="#cite_note-203">[203]</a></sup> The presence of multiple headmen within one village was fairly common: 'It has already been pointed out that a single village often has more than one nokma. If so, one of them is always considered to be the “first” nokma and the others are considered to be secondary to him. The ranking of nokmas may conceivably have been encouraged by the government’s custom of recording only a single nokma’s name for certain official purposes. But while in some doubtful cases two nokmas of about equal stature may have been [Page 225] given inequality in this way, it seems more likely that the inequality of nokmas and the requirement that one be considered senior has been inherent in Garo social organization and is not simply a response to foreign rule. If two lineages are found in the same village, each always has its own nokma, the man of its senior house. Since the nokmaship is acquired by marrying into a lineage, the nokma can never belong to the lineage of which he is nokma. So in Songmagri, where there are two lineages, the first nokma is the Chambigong nokma and is himself a Manda Sangma, but like his father-in-law he comes from another village. The Manda nokma, on the other hand, is a Chambigong of the Songmagri lineage of Chambigong. Even if a nokma comes from the opposite lineage of a two-lineage village, he is nokma only because of his marriage and never simply because of his own lineage affiliation.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-204"><a href="#cite_note-204">[204]</a></sup> 'Even villages with only one lineage may have two or more nokmas. In Rengsanggri the second nokma is Jengnon, who is himself an Agidok from Waramgri, as were his father-in-law and his grandfather-in-law before him. He is married to the woman who is heiress in the house that is considered the second oldest in the village. Jengnon is explicitly considered a nokma, but he is unquestionably second to Gajang, the first nokma, who is himself a Manda from Songmagri. Jengnon’s house does not happen to have all the symbols of nokmaship, such as the specially carved house posts or the special drum, though in other villages more than one house is sometimes equipped with these things.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-205"><a href="#cite_note-205">[205]</a></sup> Village headmen acted as intermediaries in local disputes: ‘Among the Garos most disputes arise over the issues of property, inheritance, and domestic quarrels within the family. Such problems are to a large extent settled by the MAHARI (lineage) of the offended and the offender. A new situation develops when someone's cattle cause damage to another's crops. Under such situation the NOKMA (village headman) acts as an intermediary only. If he fails to settle the dispute, the matter can go to the civil court of the district council.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-206"><a href="#cite_note-206">[206]</a></sup>  ‘Traditionally, the  nokma’s position was connected with the indigeneous customary rites. His temporal and ritual powers in a traditional society were linked with his position. The conversion of a  nokma to Christianity automatically led to the loss of his ritualistic role. When the  nokma’s were endowed with real temporal power, the resistance was great as  Nokmas were non-Christians. But when the  Nokma accepted Christianity,  nokmaship passed to another person who could act as a  nokma in performing rites and rituals. However, the Government still recognized the converted persons as  nokmas. This created dislocation in the traditional system, one looking after the customary right and other ritual responsibilities. As the author has tried to show that in the traditional system the two roles cannot be separated, the two roles are enmeshed into each other.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-207"><a href="#cite_note-207">[207]</a></sup> Nokmas also formally held titles to land: 'Perhaps the most important single characteristic of a nokma is the possession of titles to land. The land which surrounds a village is divided into numerous patches, and titles to these patches are typically distributed among a few of the richest households of the village, including those of the nokmas. A plot of land to which a man holds title is known as a’king, and a nokma who holds a title is known as an a’king nokma. Titles to a’king can be bought and sold among members of the village; [Page 226] however, at the present time sale is unusual, and land titles often stay in the same family for generations, always being inherited intact by the heir and heiress of the last title-holders. Prices in the past have varied from 25 to 75 rupees for the amount of land suitable for one family’s cultivation; on the other hand, titles even today are sometimes purchased with brass gongs instead of money.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-208"><a href="#cite_note-208">[208]</a></sup> 'Holding a title brings almost no direct benefit, for the titleholder has no more right to use the land than anyone else in the village. Nevertheless it confers great prestige, and titles like, heirlooms and jewelry, can be an important repository of savings. They can be converted into other forms of wealth and used to tide the household over poor years, as well as to give stability to its position of wealth in the village. Titles are considered even safer than ownership of heirlooms, since heirlooms can be stolen or destroyed. Moreover, title to some land is a necessary prerequisite for being considered a nokma, though land title alone is not enough. Four men in Rengsanggri had title to some land: Gajang, Jengnon, Nanggan, and Bano; but the first two of these held the most, and only they were considered nokmas. Bano was not a wealthy man, though the household he inherited had formerly been much wealthier. He performed no ceremonies appropriate to nokmaship, and people suggested that he might soon be forced to sell some of his land titles. Nanggan was much richer. He held title to more land than Bano, but still not as much as either Jengnon or Gajang. Nanggan did not perform the ceremonies of a nokma or possess any of the symbols of one; but the main obstacle to his being considered a nokma was that his household had such little genealogical depth. Nanggan purchased some of his title from one Rojang, who was from a family that had formerly been very wealthy, but who was gradually forced to sell some of his land to fellow villagers, and eventually moved away from Rengsanggri. Nanggan himself was an heir, but his father-in-law had been a non-heir who had married a girl from what is now Jengnon’s household and lived [Page 227] separately. In another generation or two, if Nanggan’s heir and his heir’s heir continue to maintain the wealth of the household, they will be obvious candidates for nokmaship, and may assume the symbols and obligations of the office.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-209"><a href="#cite_note-209">[209]</a></sup> Wealthy men were more influential than poor ones, but overall there was little status differentiation:  ‘In a Garo village very little difference of status is seen. A particular clan holds right of ownership of the village homestead and shifting cultivation lands, and the title of ownership is inherited by a particular household. The head of the land-owning household is known as the  nokma, and the particular area under which he holds ownership right is known as   a’king. He also acts as the religious head of the village, and he is to perform the ceremonies for the general well-being of the village. He is called upon to settle disputes between villagers. But in all his decisions he is guided by the elders of the village. He is not entitled to any tribute from the villagers, and he has no special paraphernalia to indicate himself as the  nokma. However, in the village a rich man gets respect, because in times of need people have to seek help from him. But in a Garo village it is usually very rare to find an extremely rich man. To a Garo wealth consists of a number of brass gongs called  rang and some ornaments made of silver or some such metal. Now-a-days a gun is also regarded as the status symbol of a wealthy man.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-210"><a href="#cite_note-210">[210]</a></sup> 'People admire the rich men, but they do not defer to them in any formal manner, and an observer could not possibly tell from watching a group of men in ordinary daily pursuits which of them were rich and which poor. If one looked at the size of their houses or measured the size of their fields, however, the relative position of the men would become fairly clear, and the more one observed the details of personal relations, the clearer it would become. Village life is so organized that few important village-wide decisions must be made, but when problems do arise people are usually willing to go along with the decisions of [Page 208] the elite. The nokma must formally designate the day for ceremonies, but before doing so he informally samples the opinions of other wealthy men. If disagreements arise about the distribution of plots for cultivation, the wealthy men can usually carry along public opinion toward some solution. I once watched villagers buying a cow for a ceremony. Every household had contributed money toward the price of the cow, but it was four or five wealthy men who put their heads together and decided whether or not to try to make the seller come down in price. These are not profound questions; but somebody must decide them, and most villagers are happy to leave them to the wealthy men. After all, they “feed” the poorer people, and their very wealth is evidence of their ability. My own judgment of the ability of the various men in the village was close to the consensus of the villagers. I agreed with them that the wealthy people were often more able and intelligent than the others. It does take more than ordinary ability to accumulate or hold on to wealth.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-211"><a href="#cite_note-211">[211]</a></sup> Accordingly, we cannot speak of an elite/commoner divide.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Ideological thought equates elites and commoners ♣ present ♥</b> The A’chik were stratified along the lines of clan, matrilineage, and moiety membership rather than social class: 'In Garo society the most important social group is the clan known as MACHONG. A machong is an exogamous matrilineal descent group wherein a Garo is automatically assigned by birth to the unilineal group of his mother. A CHATCHI (moiety) is divided into many machong. Each married couple chooses one daughter--or, if they have none, they adopt a close relative of the mother--to be heiress (NAKNA DONQIPIKA MECHIK) of the family. Her husband traditionally is selected from the lineage group of the father and is accepted as the NOKROM of the house. He resides with his wife in her parents' house. He has to take on the responsibility of looking after his parents-in-law during their old age, and his wife inherits the property.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-212"><a href="#cite_note-212">[212]</a></sup> 'The Garos reckon their kinship through the mother. Individuals measure the degree of their relationship to one another by the distance of their matrilineages. For men, children of their sister or sister's daughters are very important kin. For women, children of their sister's daughters are equivalent to the children of their own daughters.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-213"><a href="#cite_note-213">[213]</a></sup> 'Land for shifting cultivation is owned by the clan. Each village has a traditionally demarcated area of its own termed ADOK. This area is subdivided into plots that are used for cultivation in a cyclic order. The plots are distributed to the families. Allotment of the general plots is done by common consensus of the village elders. But the flat area for permanent wet cultivation is owned by individuals.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-214"><a href="#cite_note-214">[214]</a></sup> 'Property among the Garos is inherited in the female line. One of the daughters is selected by the parents to be the heiress. If the couple have no female child, a girl belonging to the machong of the wife (preferably the daughter of her sister, whether real or classificatory) is adopted to be an heiress. She is not considered to be the absolute owner of the property. Decision about the disposal of property is taken by her husband, who is considered to be the household authority (NOKNI SKOTONG). After the death of the father-in-law responsibility transfers to the son-in-law. If a dead man is survived by a widow, she stays in the family of her daughter and is sometimes referred to as an additional wife (JIK) of her daughter's husband.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-215"><a href="#cite_note-215">[215]</a></sup> Lineage heiresses and their husbands played a special role: 'Besides objects and wealth, social status is also inherited by the heir and heiress. When an older member of a household dies, the Garos view his heir as stepping into the social position of the dead person-a woman into the position of her mother and a man into the position of his ‘uncle’ and father-in-law. The clearest symbolic expression of this is the assumption by the heir of kinship terms formerly appropriate to his father-in-law. After the old man’s death, other sons-in-law call the heir by the term which is more generally used for “father-in-law,” and are in turn called “son-in-law” by the heir. It has been pointed out that Garos also speak as if the son-in-law inherited his mother-in-law when her husband dies, since after this she is regarded as a ‘wife’ of the younger man. Moreover, the wife’s siblings call him by a term that otherwise means father’s younger brother. This terminology is analyzed more fully in Appendix C. Beyond this somewhat superficial terminological matter, the occupants of the family house are considered to be the living incumbents in the role of man and woman of that particular house. Households continue, though their members come and go. The most striking example of this is the title of nokma or ‘headman’ which, as will be explained in Chapter IX, adheres to the senior household of the village. The man who happens to be married to the heiress of that household is considered to be the ‘headman’ of the village.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-216"><a href="#cite_note-216">[216]</a></sup> Prestige could be acquired through hospitality: 'A’jak and dena seem to be weighted in a lop-sided manner to the advantage of the rich members of the community, but the wealth they bring has only limited uses. Wealthy people can buy a few better clothes, eat a little more meat, command larger work parties, and therefore build bigger houses; but all this does not set them off in any sharp way from the poorer people. Rich people spend most of their time working in the fields like everyone else. The main use of wealth is to entertain on a comparatively lavish scale. This converts wealth into prestige and power, while materially the wealth is again distributed throughout the community, since everyone shares in the consumption of the goods that rich men accumulate. Feasts are not given in the Rengsanggri area on occasions designed specifically to validate or establish prestige, though such feasts do occur in some parts of the hills. The Rengsanggri custom is for ambitious men to seize as times for particularly lavish entertainment those numerous occasions when hospitality is appropriate. During the ceremonies, when the villagers are entertained in every house in turn, the richer houses entertain abundantly. The poorest houses seldom fail to offer something; but fewer people visit them, partly to avoid embarassing the householders and partly because there is less expectation of a bountiful spread. It is hardly reasonable for any single person to visit every one of the sixty households in the village, but most do assemble at the richer houses, where they can confidently expect to be greeted with copious amounts of rice beer and liberal quantities of rice and curry.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-217"><a href="#cite_note-217">[217]</a></sup> 'Entertaining is appropriate on many other occasions. When a death occurs in the community, the wealthy villagers invite others in for a consolation drink. A few relatives may kill a cow, which they say they do to honor the dead person, but which actually brings as much honor to the man who offers the cow. At the post-funeral ceremony the dead man’s household has the opportunity to kill a cow and entertain. Beer and sometimes food are distributed by participants in legal disputes. Lunch may be served to house-builders, while thatchers in particular are supposed to be rewarded with food and beer. A few households offer feasts to others out in the fields at the Asiroka ceremony, before rice planting. Even the sacrifices to banish disease may be more liberal if the family is wealthy, and thus may provide a larger feast for the helpers. A son or a daughter who has moved away from his or her parents to marry, and who is wealthy enough, may slaughter a cow, ostensibly to honor the parents. Usually the time of one of the major village festivals is chosen for this, and most of the animal is sent to the parents’ home. One leg is retained by the son’s or daughter’s family, however, and there is meat enough for two feasts, one at each house. The feast is described as one of giving thanks to the parents for their help to the child, but honor comes not only to the parents but to the child as well. The greatest hospitality and greatest prestige derive from killing a cow, and a record of the number killed is made public by decorating the front of the killer’s house with the horns and frontal bones of the animals. Wealthy houses may be hung with two or three dozen sets.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-218"><a href="#cite_note-218">[218]</a></sup> Ceremonial gongs were also important: 'One of these feasts may serve simultaneously to validate the right of a household to use its own gongs for beating at village festivals. A house must have about fifteen gongs before it is considered decent to use them, and houses which do not own enough must borrow them from a richer neighbor when they are needed. But just to accumulate and own enough gongs is not sufficient; the household must kill a cow for some occasion, such [Page 205] as to honor a parent, before the gongs can be used. After this the household will be expected to entertain regularly and on a larger than average scale, and so to maintain its prestigeful position. In Rengsanggri eight households owned enough gongs to be used in festivals: those of Gajang, Jengnon, Nanggan, Anat, Kakan, Chondu, Rongsin, and Gurang. Many other households had a few gongs but used those from one of these eight households and carried them to their houses when it was their turn to entertain during village festivals. Feasts are frequent enough for poor people to eat significantly better than they would if they relied entirely on their own gardens. Wealth differences lead to greater differences in prestige than in standards of consumption. Prestige and social standing go to the industrious and skillful.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-219"><a href="#cite_note-219">[219]</a></sup> Wealthy men tended to be more influential than poor ones: 'People admire the rich men, but they do not defer to them in any formal manner, and an observer could not possibly tell from watching a group of men in ordinary daily pursuits which of them were rich and which poor.
