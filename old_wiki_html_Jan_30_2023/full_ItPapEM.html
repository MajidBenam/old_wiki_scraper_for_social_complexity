<b> ♠ Peak Date  ♣ 1030 CE ♥ </b> {1050 CE; 1010-1030 CE} The German Emperor Henry III, <i>de facto</i> guardian of the papacy and the Patrimony, granted the city of Benevento to Pope Leo IX.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> This marked the definitive end of an independent polity centered on the city of Benevento, which had threatened the Patrimony for several centuries from the south (this Lombard menace, from north and south, was the original reason for the Frankish descent into Italy and the Frankish conquest of the Lombard Kingdom of Italy). It also was the furthest extent of (nominal) papal power until Pope Innocent III (r. 1198-1216) began consolidating what would become the Papal States.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-12"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> The period from 1036 to 1066 was characterized, however, by internal warfare and Salian invasions (despite the short-lived expansionist respite of 1049-1054 ending after Civitella). Thus, it could be argued that the real peak of the polity was under the Tusculan Reform Papacy c.1012-1036 CE because of internal and external stability, and socioeconomic and (even if limited) demographic expansion.

<p><b> ♠ Duration  ♣ 904-1198 CE ♥ </b> Beginning in 904, the Theophylacti (a noble family from Tusculanum) effectively monopolized political power in Rome, beginning a period in which the aristocratic families of Rome dominated the papacy.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-13"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> In 1198, Lothario dei Conti dei Segni was elected pope as Innocent III. During his pontificate, the papacy began consolidating its control over Lazio and expanding its power through what would become the Papal States; simultaneously, Innocent III brought papal authority to its medieval height, initiating several crusades and presiding over the Fourth Lateran Council.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-14"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ loose ♥ </b>  In general, this period was marked by a high degree of fragmentation and sub-regional autonomy, with various areas of the Patrimony of St. Peter virtually independent of the Papacy or subject to central powers in a very nominal way.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-15"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> Papal sovereignty over central Lazio was rarely in question,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-16"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> yet the papacy's ability to control subject cities and defend its territory from outside threats was often minimal, particularly in regard to territory on the fringes of papal control.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> For example, the city of Gaeta, in the extreme south of Lazio, was <i>de facto</i> independent of the papacy by the early 10th century.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-18"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> In the late eleventh and twelfth centuries, the papacy was frequently at war with the German emperors, causing serious destabilization of political authority in the Patrimony. I should emphasize, however, that it is difficult to pin down which of these terms is most accurate, since the papacy frequently entered alliances during this period, and significant parts of the Patrimony were <i>de facto</i> annexed by the Empire for decades at a time.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-19"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ vassalage ♥ </b> Papal relations with other polities fluctuated dramatically during this period; I coded it as "vassalage" to reflect the fact that the papacy during this period was often dominated by the German emperors.

</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="General_Description">General Description</span></h4>
<p>The term "Papal States" was not adopted until around 1200 CE<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-22"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>; at this time the polity of the Papacy at Rome was called the Patrimony of St. Peter, Republic of St. Peter or Land of St. Peter. The population of Rome languished at a relative historical low of 35,000 people throughout this period, which was marked by a high degree of fragmentation and sub-regional autonomy. Various areas of the Patrimony of St. Peter were virtually independent of the Papacy or subject to central authority only in a very nominal way.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-23"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>
</p><p>Through the 904-1198 CE period the polity, with its capital at Rome, was dominated by powerful families and a powerful foreign state. The Theophylacti, a noble family from Tusculanum, were the first of a number of aristocratic families who dominated the papacy.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-24"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> In the late eleventh and twelfth centuries, the papacy was frequently at war with the German emperors, which caused serious destabilization of political authority in the Patrimony.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-25"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> The German Emperor Henry III, became the <i>de facto</i> guardian of the papacy and the Patrimony.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-26"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup>

</p><p>14,000: 900 CE; 14,000: 1000 CE; 6,000: 1100 CE.  This is Wickham's figure for the <i>territorium Sancti Petri</i>, the fundamental core of the Duchy of Rome.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-28"><a href="#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup> The second figure is Wickham's estimate for Rome's territory after it had lost effective control of the rest of Lazio, during the crises of the late eleventh century.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-29"><a href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup> We need to remember, however, that the claims of the papacy were far wider, extending as they did from Rome's territory (<i>contado</i>) all the way up to the Po River Delta. 14,000: 1000 CE = inferred data.
</p><p><b> ♠ Polity Population ♣ [300,000-1,250,000]: 1000 CE; [300,000-1,115,000]: 1100 CE ♥ </b>  Inhabitants.
</p><p><i>ET</i>: <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-30"><a href="#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup>  Estimated from McEvedy and Jones "Italy" which had 5,000,000 in 1000 CE and 5,750,000 in 1100 CE. <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-31"><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> Figures divided by three to roughly approximate population ruled by this polity would be 1,666,000: 1000 CE; 1,916,000: 1100 CE.  The "Latium: Medieval Era (500-1500 CE)" coding page currently estimates the population of the Latium region only as: 335000: 904 CE; 110000: 1422 CE. These estimates for Latium conflict with the crude estimates based on the McEvedy and Jones figures for the whole of Italy since the latter do not drop from 850-1450 CE, they rise. Therefore I will assume the increase in population occurred outside of the region of this polity (Milan, Venice, Florence, Genoa?) and within this polity the population dropped, the initial McEverdy and Jones totals divided by 4 and 5 respectively.
The population of the modern administrative region of Lazio currently stands at around 5,557,2756. This follows the massive improvement of living conditions after World War II.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-32"><a href="#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup> I second the opinion expressed in the "Population" sub-section, however: there is virtually no information in the scholarship (English, French, even Italian) on the demographics of Lazio as a whole for the medieval period. Karl Julius Beloch's <i>Storia della Popolazione d'Italia</i> (1937-1961; Italian trans. 1994) remains the best account of Italian demographic patterns, but the section on the Papal States does not begin until around 1500.

<dl><dd>"Slightly separate was the ofﬁce of vestararius, which was again a ﬁnancial ofﬁce; this ofﬁcial was not a standard judge. On the other hand, when the vestararius appears in court proceedings, he seems often to preside over cases, whereas the palatine judges run the court under him; although here, too, we do not have enough evidence to be sure of a firm hierarchy of ofﬁce, vestararii seem to be political leaders of unusual importance. There were also lands in the Agro romano attached to the ofﬁce, which made it visibly remunerative. ...

<b> ♠ Religious levels ♣ 6 ♥ </b> levels.
</p><p>At time of Concordat of Worms (1122 CE). "Now the clergy were organized in a hierarchical line under the direction of the pope, who could trump the power of local custom, tradition, and even episcopal power. Below the pope stood the bishop. Responsible for maintaining clerical discipline and for overseeing the property of the church, he was answerable only to the pope. Only he could perform all the sacraments; he alone performed the sacrament of confirmation and by the sacrament of ordination passed on his power to others. Theoretically, canon law held that he would be elected by the clergy and people of his diocese. In practice, he was elected only by the canon priests attached to the cathedral. Considered high clergy, the canons aided the bishop in furthering his agenda, administering the diocese and performing rituals at the cathedral church. At their head was the dean, the highest officer in the diocese. A diocesian chancellor supervised the cathedral school and issued licenses allowing clerics to teach and preach in the diocese. A treasurer oversaw finances, while a precentor managed the choir and organized the cathedral's musical program. Each diocese was divided into administrative districts, over which presided the archdeacons. Practically, these were powerful men; they were the bishop's legates, charged with enforcing discipline among the lower clergy, and therefore they were often quite unpopular. ...

<b> ♠ Military levels ♣ 6 ♥ </b> levels.
</p><p>"...men called magister militum or superista are attested off and on throughout the century; the papal militia had both military and ceremonial importance (see below, p.333), and these were its leaders. There were clearly several such leaders at anyone time, as the Liber Pontiﬁcalis makes clear in, for example, its account of the contested papal election of 855, and other senior military ﬁgures sometimes appear, such as Cesario (son of Sergio magister militum), ordinatus super exercitum in 849. A hierarchy of rank appears earlier in 855, when Daniele magister equitum accused Graziano, eminentissimus magistro militum et Romani palatii (or Romanae urbis) superista, clearly his superior, of disloyalty to the Carolingians, a charge he could not sustain. Apart from this, however, the structure of the military side of Rome’s aristocratic hierarchies is obscure to us. A set of military offices appear in a wide array of heterogeneous texts, but we cannot put them into a credible ordering. We can say, however, that it was normal to call senior military men nobiles, and Cesario di Sergio’s case shows that they had hereditary elements; we shall see in a moment how complex links between families were by 876. The terminology just outlined becomes much less common after the beginning of the tenth century, perhaps because the supreme military leaders were by now Tefilatto and his heirs; but two people are called superista under Alberico, and Otto III brieﬂy revived the ofﬁce of magister militiae. Formal military ofﬁces cease to be documented at all after that.

For example, Theophylact, who dominated papal politics in the first decades of the tenth century, is referred to as <i>magister militum et vestararius.</i><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-98"><a href="#cite_note-98">[98]</a></sup> This bureaucracy would expand tremendously in the eleventh and twelfth centuries.
</p><p><b> ♠ Examination system ♣ absent ♥ </b> The Papacy did not use anything like the Chinese exam system for recruitment to the bureaucracy.
</p><p><b> ♠ Merit promotion ♣ present ♥ </b> While individual popes often staffed the papal bureaucracy and administration with their relatives,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-99"><a href="#cite_note-99">[99]</a></sup> foreigners and non-nobles could rise within the Church hierarchy based on merit.
</p><p><b> ♠ Specialized government buildings ♣ present ♥ </b> Papal palace complexes, in particular the Lateran palace, doubled as administrative centers; the papal <i>curia</i> was usually based in the Lateran.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Law">Law</span></h3>
<p><b> ♠ Formal legal code ♣ present ♥ </b> Codex Iustinianus, canon law. “In 1357, Albornoz promulgated a set of laws for the lands he had conquered that was later known as the Constitutiones aegidianae. This became the basic legal code of the papal states and was not superseded under the Napoleonic era.” <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-100"><a href="#cite_note-100">[100]</a></sup>
</p><p>Canon law mentioned. <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-101"><a href="#cite_note-101">[101]</a></sup>
</p><p>Papal bulls in the 1200s mentioned. <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-102"><a href="#cite_note-102">[102]</a></sup>
</p><p>1730s: “...the papal states remained in fact a collection of provinces and cities rather than an organic political unit.” (263)<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-103"><a href="#cite_note-103">[103]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Judges ♣ present ♥ </b>  "The classic placitum romanum (a convenient modern phrase; our sources just say placitum) consisted of a court president, who was the ruler of Rome or his delegate; some or all of the palatine judges, assisted by dativi iudices who were chosen case by case; a variable number of named Roman nobiles, who could make up a high percentage of the city’s ‘old aristocracy’ in major cases; and numerous other unnamed adstantes, who might sometimes have been non-aristocratic."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-104"><a href="#cite_note-104">[104]</a></sup>
</p><p>The pope himself heard legal cases - in particular disputes over church lands and ecclesiastical rights-from all over Latin Christian Europe, and the cardinals and legates (see "Administrative levels") served as judges as well. Judges were appointed in the provinces of the Patrimony for more humdrum legal work later in the period.
</p><p><b> ♠ Courts ♣ present ♥ </b> Public court known as placita. "Pierre Toubert deﬁnitively analysed the structure of the Roman placitum up to 1080, taking the story on in less detail up to 1200, in a hundred pages of Les structures du Latium médiéval." <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-105"><a href="#cite_note-105">[105]</a></sup>
</p><p>"This sort of assembly politics was typical of early medieval Europe, and was regularized by the Carolingians; it was doubtless indeed the Carolingians who extended it to Rome, for Roman practices are so close to those of Carolingian northern Italy. By the eleventh century, such placita were rare in the Frankish world, but south of the Alps they were regular in most regions until the second half of the century. Rome fits this Italian pattern, then, although, as already noted, there are indications that placita were held even more often in Rome than they were in each county further north. It was clearly easy for Roman judges and aristocrats to come together frequently, and the more often they did so the more solid their political aggregation."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-106"><a href="#cite_note-106">[106]</a></sup>
</p><p>It is unclear when it developed, but by long-standing custom, popes held a council in Rome itself during Lent to settle any ecclesiastical business (land disputes, lawsuits over rights, quarrels between bishops and their parish churches, etc.). In the late eleventh century, this system was expanded with another seasonal council held in November for the same purpose.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-107"><a href="#cite_note-107">[107]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Professional Lawyers ♣ present ♥</b> "The point about these placita was thus that they were standardized occasions, run by high-status legal experts, the palatine judges, and legitimated more widely by Rome’s aristocracy. The whole of the city’s political society came together regularly and frequently to run justice, that is to say, and the choreography of each case, while it was on one level unique every time because every case was different, on another level had considerable regularities as well."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-108"><a href="#cite_note-108">[108]</a></sup>
</p><p>Lawyers became an increasingly important part of the papal <i>curia</i> in the eleventh and twelfth centuries; the future pope Innocent III (r. 1198-1216) was a lawyer. Bologna, technically a part of the Patrimony, was the major center for legal scholarship in western Europe from the twelfth century onwards.

"This was the date of similar signs of agrarian development in eastern Lombardy, too, the hinterlands of Bergamo, Brescia, and Cremona.

Pietro today. Our documents mention several negotientes, as actors or witnesses, as one would expect; a cambiator or money changer in 1083; and several food sellers of different types. Only a few artisans appear: workers in metal and cloth. This was, then, a commercial suburb, more than a productive one.

Its hierarchical character was understood in cosmological terms.

Human beings were a ‘higher’ form of being than cattle. Cattle were ‘higher’ than the grass they ate. The grass was ‘higher’ than the earth it grew in. So thoroughgoing was the sense that this was how the universe worked that the nine orders of angels identified by the fifth-century Greek authors Pseudo-Dionysus began to be lined up alongside their human ‘counterparts’ on the understanding that each person’s place in heaven would be related to that of the equivalent angel. So the seraphim and cherubim, the contemplatives among the angels, would be accompanied for eternity by members of the contemplative orders, their human equivalents. In modern terms, this was like suggesting that post-men and motorcycle messengers would spend eternity in the company of ordinary angels, while diplomats and emissaries could expect to find themselves among archangels.//Within human society itself no premium was put upon equality. Until late in the Middle Ages, few appear to have seen anything wrong with the idea that there should be rulers and ruled, for hierarchical arrangements of parts within wholes were a normal way of making an organism ‘work’. A body needs a head but it also needs feet (I Corinthians 12.20). In fragmentary survivals of the teaching which was given in the cathedral school at Laon at the end of the eleventh and the beginning of the twelfth centuries, there is a discussion of the passage in Ephesians 6.5 where servants are told to obey their masters. ‘It is no sin to have a servant or to be a servant.’ It was argued at Laon that there are two reasons why ‘servitude is given by God.’ It may be a punishment for the sins of those who are slaves or servants.
