<p><b> ♠ Duration  ♣ 1030-722 BCE ♥ </b>The early date is speculative, being approximately when the first consolidated monarchy was established by the Israelite people (traditionally assumed to be that of King David; non-Biblical evidence for his rule is thin but nonzero, for example the stela at Tel Dan.)<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> The later date is approximately when the Assyrian Empire conquered the Northern Kingdom of Israel and exiled many of its inhabitants.
</p><p><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ confederated state ♥ </b> This is uncertain. While the region featured frequent civil war, there are no independent records or biblical traditions of powerful noblemen or the like with any territorial bases or autonomy. However, much of local administration seems to have been performed by tribal elders; and it is possible that taxes were collected within each region.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> Pfoh (2008) argues that Israel was actually a "patronage kingdom" in which the monarchy did not control a truly unitary state.

</p><p>The timeline here largely follows Kelle (2007:21-23). During the initial period, Israel is presumed to have been joined to the Davidic monarchy (or a regime with the same practical effect), which is taken to be a personal union between Israel and Judah.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> Circa 930 BCE, the Northern Kingdom splits off and develops into a separate regime; during the time of Omri and Ahab, Israel dominates its immediate neighbors and participates in an anti-Assyria regional coalition. Circa 841 BCE, Jehu seizes the throne and pays tribute to Assyria. For the next century, Israel is in a constant state of vassalage to either Assyria or Aram, as their respective political fortunes wax and wane. Finally, in 727 BCE, Israel joins in a regional rebellion against Assyria that ends with its dissolution as a polity.

"The book of 1 Kings (12:25) says that Jeroboam I built Shechem, but it also hints (14:17) that he later moved to Tirzah; 1 Kings specifically mentions Tirzah as the capital of the northern kingdom in the days of Baasha (15:21, 33; 16:6), Elah (16:8-9), Zimri (16:15), and the  first half of the reign of Omri (16:23). Assuming that Jeroboam ruled at least part of his reign from Tirzah, as did his son Nadab, as well as Tibni, Tirzah was the seat of the  first six or seven northern kings, for a period of forty to fifty years. I see no reason to doubt the authenticity of the consistent and deeply rooted information on Tirzah as the capital of Israel. The authenticity of this memory is highlighted by the fact that Tirzah does not play an important role in the rest of the Deuteronomistic History."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>
</p><p>"Tirzah lost its importance in the early ninth century, when Omri (884-873 b.c.e.) moved the capital of the northern kingdom to Samaria, possibly in his desire to establish a link with the coastal plain and the port of Dor (de Vaux 1967, 382). Indeed, the beginning of the transformation of Israel into a more complex kingdom came with the construction of the first palace at Samaria, probably by Omri. A full-scale urban transformation of the capital and the kingdom characterizes the more advanced phase of the Omride dynasty, probably in the days of Ahab (873-852 b.c.e.)."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-9"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>

<p>_Short description_
</p><p>The ancient kingdom of Israel 1030-722 CE was a monarchy established by Israelite people that was eventually conquered by the Assyrian Empire. Initially a monarchic union with Judah, around 930 BCE the Northern Kingdom (Israel) gained autonomy. In the 9th century Israel entered an anti-Assyria coalition but from Jehu (841 BCE) paid them tribute and thereafter were frequently a vassal of the Mesopotamian empire. After a revolt against Assyria in 727 CE the Assyrians ended the polity sending many of its inhabitants into exile.
</p><p>The century authorities ruled through administrative centers and fortresses sites that had "public buildings and ... large open spaces."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> Local administration may have been through tribal elders who may have been responsible for tax collection. Our image of a centralized monarchy (for some of or the whole of the period) might be tempered by the ideas of Pfoh (2008) who has argued Israel was actually a "patronage kingdom" in which a monarchy did not control a truly unitary state. Nevertheless, Israel possessed a standing army with a strong chariot corps, and used weapons of iron and bronze. Fortifications were many and imposing, and the Palace of Omri was one of the grandest in the Ancient Near East.
</p><p>At its height, Israel imposed tribute on many of the surrounding kingdoms, not only Judah but Moab, Edom, and perhaps others as well. The Israelite population primarily lived in cities and towns in the hills, with fortified cities protecting the frontiers on the plains and dominating major trade routes through the region. Trade linked Israel with its northern neighbor Phoenicia, particularly through the port of Dor. At the height of its power, Israel was also a significant military force, contributing the largest contingent to the regional coalition that turned back Assyria's first attempt to conquer the Levant.
</p><p>At least some of the population was literate even before the 10th Century BCE, though the prevalence of literacy is disputed. While the majority of the populace lived in small towns and villages, a significant fraction lived in walled cities such as the capital, Samaria. Most of the economy was in agriculture and pastoral production; staples for export included grain, wine, and oil. In the eighth century BCE the population likely exceeded well over a quarter of a million people, a vast increase on the less than 100,000 people estimated for the earliest times.
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>_Oren's long description_
</p><p>How the Kingdom of Israel began is a matter of dispute. The Bible depicts it as originally being the greater part of the old Israelite tribal confederation, and then a part of the United Monarchy under Saul, David, and Solomon (c. 1030 BCE)—before seceding during the rule of Rehaboam, and forming its own state. This narrative is more or less accepted by some archaeologists such as Mazar, while others such as Finkelstein assert that Israel actually emerged first from a process of gradual state formation, with the southern kingdom of Judah emerging later.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>
</p><p>Regardless, the two kingdoms always had close interactions, and the northern kingdom of Israel was almost always the dominant one. At its height, Israel imposed tribute on many of the surrounding kingdoms, not only Judah but Moab, Edom, and perhaps others as well. The Israelite population primarily lived in cities and towns in the hills, with fortified cities protecting the frontiers on the plains and dominating major trade routes through the region. Trade linked Israel with its northern neighbor Phoenicia, particularly through the port of Dor. At the height of its power, Israel was also a significant military force, contributing the largest contingent to the regional coalition that turned back Assyria's first attempt to conquer the Levant. Israel featured a standing army with a strong chariot corps, with weapons of iron and bronze. Fortifications were many and imposing, and the Palace of Omri was one of the grandest in the Ancient Near East.
</p><p>However, starting with the assassination of the Omrid king Jehoram by Jehu (c. 841 BCE), Israel's fortunes waned; and it spent the rest of its existence as the tributary of either Aram or Assyria, depending on which of the two empires were ascendent. Even when the economy of Israel flourished during particular periods of the next century (as attested to by the greater incidence of luxury goods in archaeological finds), Israel was still subject to the depredations of foreign powers, being invaded several times. Ultimately, following an ill-fated rebellion against Assyria, the polity of Israel was dissolved (c. 722 BCE), its people exiled, and the land turned into an Assyrian province.
</p><p>Israelite politics were marked with instability. In contrast to the kingdom of Judah, which featured a single ruling dynasty that traced its beginnings to David, Israelite kings frequently met violent ends. These would typically be at the hands of rebellious military commanders who would seize the throne, though such rebels ran the risk of being deposed themselves in short order. Zimri, one rebel captain, would rule for only a single week before losing the support of the army to rival captain Omri, founder of the Omrid Dynasty.
</p><p>At least some of the population was literate even before the 10th Century BCE, though the prevalence of literacy is disputed. While the majority of the populace lived in small towns and villages, a significant fraction lived in walled cities such as the capital, Samaria. Most of the economy was in agriculture and pastoral production; staples for export included grain, wine, and oil.
</p><p>A word of caution is in order about coding methodology. Much of the evidence we have about this polity comes from archaeological finds. However, the brute fact of an archaeological artifact is often used as the basis for considerable interpretation and conjecture. Methods have been improving over time, but still some archaeologists tend to leap far ahead of what the evidence will support. Additionally, the meaning of many finds is hotly disputed by archaeologists, each faction insisting for its point of view.
</p><p>Worse, scholars of this particular polity often operate with ideological motives - either to prove the essential historicity of the Bible, or to disprove it—which can distort their claims. Israel Finkelstein, for example, once claimed that King David never existed, before having to revise his view after the discovery of the Tel Dan Stela.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-12"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> (He now <a class="external text" href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/print/2010/12/david-and-solomon/draper-text" rel="nofollow">believes</a>, as <i>National Geographic</i> puts it, that David was "a raggedy upstart akin to Pancho Villa.") His "Low Chronology" seems to have been motivated by the attempt to disprove the early existence of the United Monarchy, and the weight of the evidence now contradicts the chronology (while still inconclusive on the matter of the United Monarchy).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-13"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> In general, it seems that many archaeologists treat the absence of evidence as evidence of absence—risky to do, considering that new finds are unearthed practically every month.
</p><p>In short, every data point that is backed up with archaeology must be considered provisional, and new discoveries can totally upend our picture of what happened. As can new interpretations that correct erroneous early interpretations, a <a class="external text" href="http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~fisher/hst140/MotelOfMysteries.html" rel="nofollow">constant danger</a> with motivated archaeologists.

</p><p>"The central hill country—between the Jezreel and the Beer-sheba Valleys—is well known archaeologically from both excavations and intensive survey projects.  The surveys, mainly those conducted in the 1980s, revealed a massive wave of settlement that swept throughout this region in the Iron I (Finkelstein 1988; 1995; Zertal 1994; Ofer 1994).  The main concentration of sites can be found in the northern part of this region, between Jerusalem and the Jezreel Valley.  The settlement process may have started in the  final phase of the Late Bronze Age (the late thirteenth or early twelfth centuries b.c.e.), accelerated in the early Iron I (the late twelfth to mid-eleventh century), and reached its peak in the late Iron I (the late eleventh and  first half of the tenth centuries b.c.e.). In the late Iron I there were approximately 250 sites in this area (compared to ca. 30 sites in the Late Bronze Age), with a total built-up area that can be estimated at roughly 220 hectares (ca. 50 hectares in the Late Bronze Age). Using the broadly accepted, average density coefficient of two hundred people living on one built-up hectare in premodern societies, the late Iron I population can be estimated at circa 45,000 people."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-15"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>
</p><p>"Estimation of population is based on the results of surface surveys; if done properly, the collection of pottery sherds at a given site can shed light on the size of the site in every period of habitation. Accordingly, one can draw a settlement map for a given period with all sites, classified according to size, and compute the total built-up area. Deploying a density coefficient (number of people living on one built-up hectare in premodern, traditional towns and villages), it is possible to reach the total number of inhabitants.  The population of [the Northern Kingdom of] Israel on both sides of the Jordan River in its peak prosperity in the middle of the eighth century can accordingly be estimated at 350,000—three times larger than the population of Judah of that time (Broshi and Finkelstein 1992)."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-16"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>
</p><p>It should be noted that these estimates are highly speculative, and there is reason to believe that they underestimate the true population by a considerable amount. "Some of the densities recently put forward for area coefficients have been based on unwalled, premodern villages…. How similar is such a village to a walled Bronze or Iron Age town or city? Although this is not a case of comparing apples and oranges (more like oranges and grapefruit), it seems probable that the economic constraints of building a defensive system put a permanent physical limit on the settlement area," leading to higher population densities.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>

<p>"Volkmar Fritz identifies three general settlement types: (1) ring-shaped villages, (2) agglomerated villages, and (3) farmsteads. Characteristic of the first type—ring-shaped villages—is the arrangement of houses in a closed circle or oval, with an open area in the center, an arrangement that possibly functioned as a means of defense, as well as providing an open area for keeping animals. The agglomerated village type consists of individual buildings, or complexes of several buildings, with streets of varying width and irregular open areas left between the individual units. The edges of this village type are open, and living space is relatively close and restricted. The third type of settlement—farmsteads—consists simply of single buildings or groups of buildings surrounded by a widely extending wall, which may have functioned as an enclosure for animals."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-20"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup>

In larger centers, such as Tel Dan, the paved plaza outside the city gate was a more developed locale—though the stalls for such a marketplace could still be temporary and the traders might only occasionally visit. Perhaps the most developed attempt to outline a local extramural market center would be the recent work of Yifat Thareani, who argues that the public building at Tel Aroer, containing an unusually large number of weights for measuring silver, served a commercial function (2011: 161-73, 301-4)."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-28"><a href="#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup></dd>

As such it transmits Judahite ideas regarding territory, kingship, temple, and cult. Moreover, even what some scholars consider as the early layers of the history of ancient Israel, such as the books of Samuel (e.g., McCarter 1994; Halpern 2001; Römer and de Pury 2000, 123-28; Hutton 2009), were written after the northern kingdom was vanquished by Assyria and its elite was deported.…  The original northern texts—or at least some of them—could have been written as early as the  first half of the eighth century b.c.e. in the capital Samaria or in the temple of YHWH at Bethel, located on the northern border of Judah (also Fleming 2012, 314-21; for a later date of compilation at Bethel, see Knauf 2006; Davies 2007a, 2007b; for the archaeology of Bethel, see Finkelstein and Singer-Avitz 2009).

<dd><b> ♠ Complex fortifications ♣ present ♥ </b> “During the United Monarchy much use was made of the so-called casemate wall, which consisted of two parallel walls joined at determined intervals by perpendicular walls. Casemate walls could be freestanding, as at Megiddo VA, or could be integrated into city buildings, as at Beer-sheba II. Casemate walls could be used as soldiers’ dwellings, or to store food or weapons that could be used in case of siege. Sometimes the stone casemates served as a framework, which was filled with earth. From the Divided Monarchy onwards massive walls are more frequent. The earliest type is the inset and offset type, built with sections of around 6m long that alternately project and recede. The degree of projection was 0.5-0.6m. Megiddo IVA is the best example of this type.”<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-67"><a href="#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup></dd>

<p>Whether a hereditary nobility existed during this time is unclear. If it did, it has no ideological justification at all in the Bible, whose ideology is broadly egalitarian. Surrounding cultures were, however, strongly stratified; so it is conceivable that Israelite kings may have tried to set up a nobility to reward their supporters. Ahab had his גדולים, "great ones" (II Kings 10:11), and other texts reference חורים, often translated as "nobles," but whether these actually reflected a hereditary nobility or simply prominent men is totally unknown. During the United Kingdom succession struggle of Solomon and Adoniyahu (depicted in I Kings 1), the key supporters of each side are priests, prophets, or military men; but that does not exclude a nobility arising later. (Relatedly, whether royal bureaucrats were selected or hereditary is also unknown, though families of powerful royal bureaucrats are attested to in the Southern Kingdom;<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-68"><a href="#cite_note-68">[68]</a></sup> and the line between "noble" and "bureaucrat" is fine indeed.)
</p><p>Kessler<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-69"><a href="#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup> identifies the עמי הארץ ("people of the land") of the Southern Kingdom as a "landed aristocracy." Prominent and powerful people they certainly were, but to be a true aristocracy one must not simply have power, but some sort of formal caste privilege, for which evidence is unclear. But here we get to a question of definition: if one's father is wealthy and that wealth passes on to you, does that count as a "hereditary elite status" in our present sense? In any event, while one might infer the existence of a similar group in the Northern Kingdom, there is no explicit reference to them.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Deification_of_Rulers">Deification of Rulers</span></h3>
<p><b>♠ Rulers are legitimated by gods ♣ present ♥</b> "The religious politics of antiquity can be called “divine patronage” (Noll 2001a, pp. 207-15, 265-8). In most cases, it worked this way: a human king owed his authority to one god, his divine patron." <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-70"><a href="#cite_note-70">[70]</a></sup> "The rise of David as king over all Israel and his selection of Jerusalem as his political and religious capital plays a foundational role in the conceptualization and development of ancient Israelite religion because it establishes a close interrelationship between the Davidic kings and YHWH. This interrelationship is evident in YHWH's promise of an eternal dynasty to David immediately after David brings the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem in 2 Sam. 6. According to 2 Sam. 7, David had thought to build a “house” or Temple for YHWH once he had become king, but the prophet Nathan came to David and declared that YHWH did not desire a “house.” Instead, YHWH would build a “house,” i.e., a dynasty, for David so that his descendants would rule forever in Jerusalem. David never built the “house,” or Temple, for YHWH in Jerusalem, but his son Solomon did and thereby established the Davidic monarchy and the Jerusalem Temple as the two primary institutions of ancient Israel or Judah. In short, the House of David established and supported the Jerusalem Temple of YHWH, and YHWH established and supported the House of David." <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-71"><a href="#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup>
</p><p>While this refers to the Southern Kingdom, it is clear from the Bible that rulers in the Northern Kingdom used a similar strategy. Jeroboam I sets up a competing cult to that in Jerusalem to legitimate his own kingship; Ahab establishes the worship of the Phoenician Baal; Jehu claims to have usurped the kingship from Ahab's sons acting as YHWH's agent.
