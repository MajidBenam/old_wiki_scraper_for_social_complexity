<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="General_Description">General Description</span></h4>
<dl><dd>The period between 1336 and 1467 CE in Japan is known by several different names but is referred to here as 'Muromachi Ashikaga', a combination of two designations used in isolation in some sources. Muromachi, a district of Kyoto, was the base of the shogunate's power, while Ashikaga is the name of the family who served as shoguns throughout the period.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-15"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> The Muromachi Ashikaga period sometimes includes the sub-periods known as 'the Northern and Southern Courts' and the 'Warring States', although we have decided to separate the Warring States period into its own polity.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-16"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The period begins with the disintegration of Emperor Go-Daigo's brief 'Kenmu Restoration', an unsuccessful attempt to restore direct imperial control in Japan, and the appointment of Ashikaga Takauji as shogun by another branch of the imperial line with the support of other disillusioned lords.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> This initiated the divide between the Northern and Southern Courts (1336-1392 CE), both of which claimed to be the legitimate ruling authority. The Northern Court was located in Kyoto and headed by Emperor Komyo (from the senior imperial line) and the Ashikaga shoguns. The Southern Court was located at Yoshino and was the seat of the Emperor Go-Daigo (from the junior imperial line) and his supporters.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-18"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The peak of the Ashikaga period corresponds to the reign of Shogun Yoshimitsu (r. 1368-1394 CE), who helped to broker the unification of the Northern and Southern Courts (1392 CE), with imperial succession reinstated through the Northern line. An able statesman, he helped advance many aspects of government and policy and was an active patron of the arts.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-19"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> His death in 1408 left a power vacuum that enabled provincial lords to gain greater independence from the court and shogunate.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The Onin War (1467-1477 CE) effectively brought an end to this period, although the Ashikaga shogunate remained in power nominally until the overthrow of their last shogun by Oda Nobunaga in 1573.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-20"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> This civil war, precipitated by economic problems, famine and conflicts over succession (both to the shogunate and to provincial military offices) initiated the period of instability known as the Warring States period. The conflict destroyed much of Kyoto, and spilled out into the provinces.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-21"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Initially, the power of the Ashikaga Shogunate had theoretically extended throughout the main islands of Japan; however, by the time of the Onin War, the area under its direct control had shrunk to Kyoto and its hinterland.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-22"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-23"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> Despite this territorial disintegration, the 'idea' of a larger unified culture did not disappear.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-24"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p><i>Population and political organization</i>
</p>
<dl><dd>During the period of the Northern and Southern Courts, the respective imperial heads were nominally in power, while the Ashikaga shogunate controlled the government. In contrast to the preceding Kamakura military regime, the Ashikaga shoguns did not have absolute control: their power was in tension with 'other court families, other members of the military aristocracy, and the religious orders'.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-25"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> Initially the Ashikaga shogunate retained much of the Kamakura administrative structure, even continuing to occupy the government buildings in Kamakura before moving their administration to the Muromachi district in 1378 CE.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-26"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> Because the Ashikaga clan 'lacked significant landholdings and military might', these shoguns relied on their relationships with powerful vassals and provincial military governors to enforce their policies and keep other lords in line. However, as personal ties of loyalty deteriorated over time, the control of the shogunate over powerful provincial lords loosened and the latter were able to increase their independence from the central government.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-27"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-28"><a href="#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Population estimates for this period range from roughly 10 million around 1300 CE to approximately 17 million in 1500 CE.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-29"><a href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-30"><a href="#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup></dd></dl>

Control of Kyoto, in and of itself, was an important achievement, and the fact that Kyoto became subject to bakufu administration was of major significance for the Ashikaga house's staying ability.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-32"><a href="#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup> These trends reached a peak during the so-called sengoku or ‘warring states’ period (1467-1568) when the Japanese state itself began to fragment, causing the old borders to lose their original meaning as they were supplemented and replaced by a new system of ‘internal’ borders.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-33"><a href="#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup> 'regional powers became more and more independent after the Onin War of the mid fifteenth century. During the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries these warlords, known as sengoku daimyo¯, consolidated their rule over domains that were essentially sovereign ‘mini-states’.

'For the nearly 700-year span of Japan’s medieval and early modern periods, warriors-with varying levels of effectiveness and hegemony-ruled the country. Although the fortunes of particular extended warrior families waxed and waned, only members of the warrior class could serve as shoguns, the military rulers. Their governments, known commonly as shogunates, were often challenged by the interests of other powerful warrior families in various parts of Japan and by the imperial family in Kyoto. Although the warrior bureaucracy largely controlled the affairs of the state, the emperor and the imperial court were still the formal head of government. Warrior governments typically sought out- or forced-the formal imperial decrees that gave legitimacy to the shoguns. Occasionally emperors would attempt to reassert direct imperial rule. They were, however, always suppressed in favor of warrior rule... Warrior governments functioned as a lord-vassal system of loyalty. This is reflected in the political structures of the different shogunates. Although they varied greatly in their organization, the notion of loyalty, whether earned or forced, always laid the foundation on which the warrior government was built.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-46"><a href="#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup> 'The Ashikaga shoguns of the medieval period, for all the noble status they had acquired, were obliged to share political power with other court families, other members of the military aristocracy, and the religious orders.

With the consultation of a board of scholars and advisers, Ashikaga Takauji included the major addition made by the Muromachi in 1336. This supplemental edict, the Kemmu Shikimoku, was based on a seventh century constitution written by Prince Shotoku and consisted of 17 articles dealing with the attitudes and behaviors expected of the warrior class. These items dealt with issues ranging from personal habits to the attention a ruler should pay the courtiers and peasants. Another major contribution of the Muromachi period to the legal structure of Japan was the development of principles of group responsibility known as renza and enza... Legal disputes were discouraged with the promotion of the kenka ryoseibai policy, which stated that the factions on either side of any argument were to be held equally accountable for the disagreement... shogunal succession leading to the Onin War caused a destabilization within the Muromachi government resulting in a decentralization of power starting as early as the 1460s.

Dates on this calendar represented the day, month, and year, the last of which could be determined by several methods. Two such methods included the 60-year time cycle and the use of the era name, or nengo. Nengo was a unit of time comparable to an era, commonly employed to date events or chronological periods. The use of this measure of time began in the seventh century. The change of emperor included a change in era name. However, in the early modern period, the nengo did not simply represent the duration of a governmental regime. New era names might be declared when auspicious events occurred or at certain points in the traditional 60- year (sexagenary) calendar cycle...

It may well be that the stones were simply dropped from the castle  walls, an impression strengthened by the fact that so many of the victims were flag bearers, who traditionally would be the first to approach the enemy defences.

The armor found in the grove mounds of prior to 400 B.C. is made by riveting together small pieces of iron to make helmets and cuirasses. Some of the latter give quite the effect of plate armor but are built up of small pieces. By the 10th century, the earliest time of which we have definite knowledge, it had assumed a characteristic form which it retained until armor was abandoned in the middle of the 19th century. A Japanese suit, fig. 78, consists of a helmet, kabuto, usually made of a large number of narrow plates riveted together with raised edges at the joints. It has a small peak, maizashi, in front and a wide neck guard, shikoro, made of strips of steel or of scales of leather or steel laced together with heavy silk or leather cords. One or more of these pieces is turned back in front to form ear guards, fukigayeshi. The front is usually decorated with two horn-like pieces, kuwagata, representing the leaves of a water plant; between them is an ornament, maidate, corresponding to the European crest. The face is covered by a steel mask, menpo, to which a laminated neck guard, yodare-kake, is attached. There are five varieties of menpo - covering the entire face - all of the face below the eyes - the forehead and cheeks only - and two for the cheeks and chin only. Of these, the second is much most used. A gorget, nodowa, was sometimes worn but was not considered as a regular part of the suit.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Constraint on executive by government ♣ present ♥</b> The Shogun was reliant on the provincial constables to provide soldiers and taxes, there are several examples of these provincial lords refusing to cooperate and even supporting the Shogun's opponents - such as the emperor's faction in the first half of the polity's existence. "The Ashikaga shoguns, however, had less support from this inheritance and were required to depend more upon institutions of their own making; hence their reliance on the provincial constables to whom they delegated much local authority. Under the Muromachi bakufu, the shugo acquired political influence by combining the authority the post had commanded under the Kamakura bakufu with that customarily available to the civil provincial governors under the imperial system. The chain of command among shogun, shugo, and provincial retainers now carried almost the entire burden of government, both nationally and locally." <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-165"><a href="#cite_note-165">[165]</a></sup> "As chiefs of the military estate, the Ashikaga shoguns did maintain a private bureaucracy and a guard force drawn from their extensive but individually weak jitō-grade vassals. But these direct retainers were limited in number, and in regard to serious military action, or to the staffing of important bakufu offices, the Ashikaga were heavily dependent on the shugo support." <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-166"><a href="#cite_note-166">[166]</a></sup> "Under the Kamakura bakufu, shugo had been given three specific functions: (1) enrolling bakufu retainers for guard duty at Kyoto and Kamakura, (2) suppressing major crimes like murder and piracy, and (3) punishing treason. In 1346, the Muromachi bakufu added twomore important powers. The first conferred the right to deal with the unlawful cutting of crops - a favorite act of akuto bands. The second, in practical terms, meant the right to carry out the bakufu's orders to confiscate or redistribute land rights. Together, these legal provisions gave the shugo the authority to exercise major judicial and fiscal powers that heretofore had been exercised by organs of the central government." <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-167"><a href="#cite_note-167">[167]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Constraint on executive by non-government ♣ present ♥</b> The Shogun also had to keep nobles and religious groups on his side, especially as several still legally owned estates that provided taxes and troops, despite many of these provinces being managed by provincial constables in practice. "During the first half of the Muromachi era, however, the Ashikaga shoguns, by occupying the middle ground between these two positions, managed to stave off the demise of the shoen-based nobility for yet another two centuries." <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-168"><a href="#cite_note-168">[168]</a></sup> "The first supplementary law, issued in 1337, shows that the bakufu's principal concern was to recall the previously awarded "temporary" tax powers to protect the interests of the most highly placed noble and priestly proprietors. It demanded that lands held by shugo and other military officers for commissariat support "be immediately returned to the estate agents of the civil proprietors." A directive issued in 1338 accused the shugo of abusing this privilege, by taking permanent possession of lands occupied for military support and even distributing them among their own retainers. The bakufu was clearly in a bind. Its primary interest in the provinces was to build up the strength of its shugo; yet it could not deny entirely the interests of the capital nobility and priesthood." <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-169"><a href="#cite_note-169">[169]</a></sup></dd>

It tells the story of the birth of the kami, especially the birth of Amaterasu, the sun goddess, from whom the Japanese imperial family - and by extension the Japanese people - are descended. The narrative tells of how Ninigi no Mikoto, grandson of Amaterasu Omikami, was sent to establish sovereignty over the Japanese islands. It was Ninigi’s great grandson, Jimmu, who became, according to the narrative, the first emperor of Japan. All Japanese emperors are said to descend from this sacred line beginning with Amaterasu. The three regalia - mirror, sword, and jewel - the symbols of imperial ruling authority, are said to have originated with Amaterasu who started the tradition of passing these symbols to each subsequent ruler. In the medieval and early modern periods (in fact, up until 1945), this Kojiki narrative was used to argue the legitimacy of the imperial family as rightful rulers." <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-172"><a href="#cite_note-172">[172]</a></sup>

And since “the ‘’kami’’ are like humans, emperors too have been human to most Japanese” and, throughout history, “there have been many folktales pointing to the humanness of the emperors”, for example ones centering on an eighteenth-century crown-prince’s love for soba noodles <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-175"><a href="#cite_note-175">[175]</a></sup>.
