<p><b>♠ RA ♣ Eva Brandl; Daniel Mullins; Dennis Spencer ♥</b> DS contributed the general description.
</p><p><b> ♠ Original name  ♣ Ashanti Empire ♥ </b>
</p><p><b> ♠ Alternative names  ♣ Ashante; Asante; Asanteman; Asantemanso ♥ </b>
</p><p><b> ♠ Peak Date  ♣ 1800-1824 CE ♥ </b> 'Between Osei Tutu and Osei Bonsu (1800-1824) the Asante conquered or otherwise brought into subjection to the Asantehene (King of Asante), nearly all the peoples now inhabiting all the regions of modern Ghana and also east-central and south-western Ivory Coast (Rattray, 1923: 287-293; Priestley and Wilks, 1960; Fynn, 1971: 105, 155; Meredith, 1812; Wilks, 1975; 43-79).' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> 'Looking back they recall how, until the last quarter of the nineteenth century, they controlled an ever-increasing area which at its peak stretched over 550 km into the interior and encompassed many distinctive groups and regions. Asante armies were powerful and well-organised, equipped with imported firearms scarcely available to poorer and more isolated northern groups.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> Within this general trend of military conquest and domination, the peak period was likely the early 19th century, characterized by military successes against the British: 'One major reason for this increase in British influence came as a result of Asante expansion toward the coast. For the Asante this was vitally necessary to ensure a ready supply of European firearms to maintain their hold over their outlying provinces. [...] In 1806 the Asante, under their dynamic leader, Asantehene Osei Bonsu, defeated the Fante and besieged the British fort at Anomabu. In 1811, 1814, and 1816 the Asante again invaded the Fante area and finally established domination over the coast. [...] A dispute over jurisdiction eventually led to war, but Macarthy's forces proved no match for the Asantes. In 1824, at the battle of Nsamankow, they were ambushed and the governor and seven of his officers were killed. At this point the Asante empire was at the height of its power.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Temporal_bounds">Temporal bounds</span></h4>
<p><b> ♠ Duration  ♣ 1701-1895 CE ♥ </b> This period begins in 1701 CE when 'the Asantemanso under the leadership of Osei Tutu (d. 1717) rebelled and defeated the Denkyira'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>. This period ends in 1895 CE, 'the last year in which the Union was intact before defeat by the British, exile of the King, and conquest.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ confederated state ♥ </b> The Union founded after Osei Tutu's military victory against the Denkyira incorporated a set of allied sub-polities under the overall authority of the Asantehene based at Kumasi: 'In the aftermath of the Denkyira war the military coalition of states was transformed into a political union.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> For Hayford, this union was essentially a confederation of several 'imperia in imperio' under the paramount authority of the Asantehene: 'The Native State, in its highest development, is to be found where a number of considerably important communities combine and own allegiance to one central paramount Authority. Such Authority is the King, properly so called. Thus in Ashanti, before the breaking up of the Court at Kumasi, there were the Manpons, the Juabins, the Kokofus, the Beckwas, the Adansis, and several other large and important communities, owning allegiance to the stool of Kumasi as the paramount stool of all Ashanti. Each of these important communities, when regarded with respect to the entire State, was a sort of imperium in imperio-in fact, several distinct native states federated together under the same laws, the same customs, the same faith and worship, the people speaking the same language, and all owning allegiance to a paramount king or president, who represented the sovereignty of the entire Union.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> For Arhin, the 'official', confederated character of the Ashanti Union was being increasingly eroded during the time period in question, with the Asantehene seeking to concentrate power in Kumasi: 'Formally the Asante lived within a system of decentralized ‘patrimonialism’: that is to say, under the authority of hereditary rulers selected by the heads of the constituent units of the  oman, the localized matrilineages, the villages and the districts who were, in the main, a gerontocratic body. The members of the various units also enjoyed rights of use in land. But the political history of Asante, from the beginning of the eighteenth century to the eve of colonial rule, was the history of the erosion of these political and economic rights. It was a history of the increasing personalization of power at the expense of the holders of hereditary authority and also of commoners.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> British colonial incursions subsequently upset the indigenous power structure and weakened Kumasi by imposing their own administration on the native system, including a court of 'appeals in the hands of a British administrative officer' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-9"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>, and by backing indigenous resistance against the King. Wilks describes a dynamic struggle between competing interests:  'The Kumaseman sought to build up its power to ensure not only its de jure but also its de facto preeminence within the Asanteman. It moved slowly but surely towards a form of absolutism. The  aman resisted the engrossment of power by Kumase and strove to maintain a “parcellization” of sovereignty of the sort also characteristic of feudalism.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> This supports the characterization of Asanteman as a confederated state despite of this process of centralization: 'It is arguable that the union, the Asanteman, has survived precisely because different (and even conflicting) concepts of its nature have always been possible. Did member states, for example, have a right to secede, or was the union indissoluble? In the early nineteenth century the Dwabenhene clearly believed that he did have the right, the Asantehene that he did not.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥ </b> 'Although ethnically and culturally closely related, the Akan have never had a common polity, and they may be roughly divided into the Brong, Akyem, Akuapim, Kwawu, Assen-Twifo, Wasa, Fante-Agona, Nzima-Evalue, Ahanta and Ashanti, each group speaking a distinct dialect.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-12"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> 'Greater Asante' was a conglomerate made up of sub-polities paying allegiance to Kumasi and tributary states: 'First, there was the Kumasi state, administered like any other Asante state by the Asantehene and his council members. Second, Kumasi, together with the neighbouring Asante-Twi-speaking states, formed the Asante Union, with a council consisting of the Asantehene, some members of the Kumasi state council, and the heads of the other Asante states. Third, there were the “provinces,” consisting of the other Twi-speaking peoples north and south of Asante. Fourth, there were the non-Twi-speaking protectorate and tributary states southeast and north of the Twi-speaking peoples.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-13"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> This structure did not depend on alliances with external forces. SCCS variable 84 'Higher Political Organization' is coded 'Absent', not 'Peace group', 'Alliances', 'Confederation', or 'International organization'.

<dl><dd><b> ♠ preceding (quasi)polity  ♣ Akan - Pre-Ashanti ♥ </b> Asantemanso Kingdom 'The Portuguese first arrived in 1471 and later built a trading post at Elmina in 1486. Drawn by the trading activity on the coast, descendants of the defunct Bonda and Kumbu kingdoms settled along the north-south trade routes connecting the coast to the Niger bend region. The Queen mother of the Bonda founded the Akyerekyere kingdom along one trade route, which became a clearinghouse for goods from the coast. A prince of the former Kumbu royal house founded the Akumu-Akoto kingdom on another trade route. The Portuguese referred to this latter kingdom as the 'Acanes,' hence the name Akan. Emigrants from Akumu-Akoto founded a second city-state to the east, called Akwamu. Emigrants from Akwamu in turn founded the Asantemanso kingdom in the Kumasi region. Mande-speaking immigrants conquered the Akyerekyere kingdom and later the Asantemanso kingdom to become the dominant power in the region, the Denkyira. In 1701, the Asantemanso under the leadership of Osei Tutu (d. 1717) rebelled and defeated the Denkyira.'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-14"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> 'He became the overall King (or Asantehene) of a group of allied towns or states centred around Kumase. According to Asante traditions he followed earlier rulers, the almost mythical twins Twum and Antwi, then Oti Akenten and Obiri Yeboa, his predecessor, slain in war. Traditions indicate that the kingdom's founders spread out from an early settlement in Adanse to settle at Kumase, near the earlier trading town of Tafo. They conquered groups already settled in the area and were joined by other bands of immigrants from earlier states to the south, attracted by the opportunities the new area offered. The new kingdom included the towns of Bekwae, Kokofu, Mampon, Nsuta, Dwaben and Edweso and was apparently organised on principles evolved in earlier, more southerly kingdoms like Denkyira and Akwamu. The founding  [...] states each had its ‘paramount chief’ or  Omanhene.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-15"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b> ♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥ </b> 'The Asante wars had their origin in the seventeenth century in the course of attempts by Oti Akenten and Obiri Yeboah to establish the power of their segment of the Oyoko clan, based in Kokofu in Amansee, in the area now covered by Kumasi City. Obiri Yeboah died in war with the Dorma people, then located within four miles of Kumasi, and was succeeded by Osei Tutu (died 1717). Osei Tutu defeated the Dorma (Reindorf, 1895: 50; Fuller, 1968: 2) and led the Asante to conquer Denkyira (Bosman, 1705), their south-western neighbour and erstwhile overlords, in 1699-1708  [...] Between Osei Tutu and Osei Bonsu (1800-1824) the Asante conquered or otherwise brought into subjection to the Asantehene (King of Asante), nearly all the peoples now inhabiting all the regions of modern Ghana and also east-central and south-western Ivory Coast (Rattray, 1923: 287-293; Priestley and Wilks, 1960; Fynn, 1971: 105, 155; Meredith, 1812; Wilks, 1975; 43-79).' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-16"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b> ♠ succeeding (quasi)polity  ♣ British Empire Gold Coast Colony ♥ </b> 'By 1872 the British had complete control of the coast after taking over the Dutch and Danish forts. When they did not recognize Ashanti sovereignty in the area, the Ashanti invaded. In 1874, British forces launched a counteroffensive and sacked Kumasi. In 1883 a general uprising led to the overthrow of the Ashanti chi ef Mensu Bonsu and four years of civil war (1884-1888). A faction representing mercantile interests prevailed, although an Imperial faction regained power in the following decade. This led to another war with the British, who again attacked Kumasi in 1895 and captured the Ashanti king and chiefs. The king and chiefs were exiled and in 1901 the whole region was declared a British possession.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b> ♠ Supracultural entity ♣ West Africa ♥ </b> 'The Asante, however, are only the most successful of a number of people in southern Ghana, with offshoots in the Ivory Coast, who are closely related and probably have a single origin. To the south are groups like the Fante, Akwamu and Akyem, speaking virtually identical tonal languages (sometimes called Twi, or Akan) of the Kwa family and with whom the Asante share many elements of culture. Among these groups, for example, there are traces of the great matrilineal clans [...] formerly recognised in Asante, the practice of naming children according to the day of birth (for example, Kofi, a Friday-born male; Abena, a Tuesday-born girl), and many closely similar religious ideas and rituals. Some of these groups also retain traditions of a move to the south from the open areas north of the forest.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-18"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> Sarbah agrees with this view: 'The common origin of the inhabitants of the Fanti districts, Asanti, and wherever the Akan language is spoken, has been already shown. The Customary Laws of the inhabitants of these places are in the main identical, and the national constitutions resemble each other in many points, although Asanti military organization had been developed in a greater degree.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-19"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> Hayford comments on cultural and linguistic similiarities between the Ashanti and Fante peoples: 'They speak the same language with only a difference of accent, such difference being a refinement upon whichever form of speech was the original type.

'The Asante, however, are only the most successful of a number of people in southern Ghana, with offshoots in the Ivory Coast, who are closely related and probably have a single origin. To the south are groups like the Fante, Akwamu and Akyem, speaking virtually identical tonal languages (sometimes called Twi, or Akan) of the Kwa family and with whom the Asante share many elements of culture. Among these groups, for example, there are traces of the great matrilineal clans [...] formerly recognised in Asante, the practice of naming children according to the day of birth (for example, Kofi, a Friday-born male; Abena, a Tuesday-born girl), and many closely similar religious ideas and rituals.

<dl><dd>The gold-producing region between the Comoé and Volta rivers has been inhabited by Akan-speaking people since the 13th century CE. This region has seen the emergence of various autonomous states, including Bono, Djomo, Akwamu, Fante, and Asante. Later in its history, the founders of the Ga and Ewe states arrived from what is now Nigeria.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-36"><a href="#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup> In 1471, Portuguese sailors reached this stretch of coast and quickly established trade with the coastal Akan states, exchanging European goods for gold.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-37"><a href="#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup> Trade routes soon connected the coast to the Niger bend region, along which descendants of the former Bonda and Kumbu kingdoms founded the Akyerekyere and Akumu-Akoto kingdoms respectively. The Portuguese referred to this latter kingdom as the 'Acanes', which is the source of the name Akan.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-38"><a href="#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>In 1701, the Asante rebelled against the dominant Denkyira state and formed a confederacy of Akan states who accepted Asante rule. This confederacy began to conquer the surrounding polities, and by 1764 the Greater Asante controlled an area nearly the size of present-day Ghana.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-39"><a href="#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Europeans continued to be drawn to the Ghanaian coast in search of gold and, by the 19th century, the British were the strongest European power in the region. In 1827, British-led troops defeated an Asante army at Katammanso.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-40"><a href="#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup> In 1831, the British and Asante signed a peace treaty that allowed trade in all ports, and by 1844 the British gained control over criminal matters in the areas around trade forts. By 1872, the British had complete control of the coast, and when they did not recognize Asante sovereignty, the Asante attacked. The British were victorious, and after another war in 1895, the Asante king and chiefs were exiled. The entire region was declared a British territory in 1901.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-41"><a href="#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p><i>Population and political organization</i>
</p>
<dl><dd>During the pre-Asante period, each Akan state consisted of a single kingdom ruled by an <i>omanhene</i>, which literally translates to 'state-chief'.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-42"><a href="#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup> This king came from a royal clan, and was elected by various officials, most notably the <i>ohemmaa</i> ('queen-mother'), who was a senior woman of the clan. The king was a sacred person who could not be observed eating or drinking; nor could he be heard to speak or be spoken to.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-43"><a href="#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>After 1701, political organization within the region became far more bureaucratic and specialized. Kumasi became the capital of the union of Asante states and the seat of the empire. Appointed officials began to replace those wielding hereditary authority, and a treasury partly operated by literate Muslims was created.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-44"><a href="#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup> However, while bureaucrats ran many of the day-to-day operations of the empire, the authority of the king was still absolute.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-45"><a href="#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Population estimates are not available for the pre-Asante period. The population of the entire Asante union in 1874 is estimated at three million people.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-46"><a href="#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup></dd></dl>

This is the area that, following Kwame Arhin, we have come to know as “Greater Asante” rather than “the Asante Empire.” [...] The Asante lacked cartographic skills, and Greater Asante had, therefore, to be “mentally mapped.” In 1817, T. E. Bowdich was the first to make a serious attempt to represent the extent of Greater Asante on paper and to locate what he called the “boundary of Ashantee authority.” In doing so, he drew heavily upon Asante perceptions of space.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-48"><a href="#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup>  Wilks' informants measured distance in travel time rather than geographical figures: 'Kumase, the capital, was the central point from which the great roads of Asante, the  nkwantεmpon, radiated out. The day's journey, the  kwansin, was the basic unit in terms of which distance from the capital was measured.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-49"><a href="#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup> But McLeod provides an approximation: 'Looking back they recall how, until the last quarter of the nineteenth century, they controlled an ever-increasing area which at its peak stretched over 550 km into the interior and encompassed many distinctive groups and regions. Asante armies were powerful and well-organised, equipped with imported firearms scarcely available to poorer and more isolated northern groups.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-50"><a href="#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup> The Republic of Ghana today covers an area of almost 240,000 squared kilometers, the coastline being around 540km long.

<p><b> ♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ 4 ♥ </b> levels. According to Ethnographic Atlas variable 31 'Mean Size of Local Communities', the Ashanti possess 'Towns of 5,000-50,000 (one or more)', meaning that they are likely to have a settlement hierarchy as follows: (1) Town (administrative buildings, storehouse)) (2) Village (shrine) (3) Hamlet (residential only). This remains to be confirmed. SCCS variable 157 'Scale 9-Political Integration' is coded as '3 levels above community'
</p><p>(1) the Capital with its central administrative and political functions;
(2) regional Towns housing the leaders of divisions of the Ashanti Union;
(3) Villages integrated into the recognized regional power hierarchies, comprising multiple family farms;
(4) residential Hamlets and other non-permanent micro-settlements
</p><p>A reviewer of Arhin's work comments on some general features of the territorial hierarchy: 'the Asante people formed a typical African kingdom, headed by a paramount ruler called “king” who, from his central village or town, administered the community in groups of villages with their own administrative and political organizations that owed absolute allegiance to the king, sometimes miles away. In every such African kingdom there was a princely city, special in every sense-the home of the paramount ruler of the state, the centre of government, and the residence of members of the royal family, religious leaders, courtiers, members of the extended-family system, servants, and slaves. Its economic, political, and cultural characteristics flowed down to the villages that made up the state [...] Every village consisted of free-born citizens, servants, and slaves. Individuals were like the fingers of a hand, all working together for the betterment of the village and, through the council of elders and the king's representative or chief, paying tribute to and serving their lord and master' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-53"><a href="#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup> Arhin's own work confirms this: 'An Asante state consisted of divisions ( amansin), which in turn consisted of villages ( nkuro) and hamlets ( nkuraa). The hamlet was of no political significance, since, like the hunting lodge ( nnanso), it was a temporary settlement. The village, inhabited by members of localised matrilineages of three or more of the dispersed Akan matriclans ( mmusua) (Rattray 1929: 67), was headed by an individual called the owner of the village ( odekro).' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-54"><a href="#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup> Villages can accordingly be differentiated from Hamlets by virtue of their integration into regional lineage structures: 'A village proper is distinguished from less permanent settlements as much by social complexity as by sheer size. Nearly all established villages are occupied by a number of distinct matrilineal groups, perhaps as many as five or six. [...] The establishment of a core of women in a village, who have children there, and whose daughters there give birth to other daughters who will continue the matrilineage, marks that settlement's existence as an independent and viable unit. Marriage, birth and death, as much as sheer numbers, mark the distinction between a well-established village and a settlement of less certain status.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-55"><a href="#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup> Hamlets could develop into more complex villages: 'an akuraa might, in favourable circumstances, develop into a village proper ( okrom), with its own name and chief or  odekuro and a clearly defined position in the kingdom's political and military framework. This change in status usually occurred gradually and only after the place became the primary residence of many of those using it.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-56"><a href="#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Administrative levels ♣ 6 ♥ </b> levels. According to the Ethnographic Atlas' variable 33 'Jurisdictional Hierarchy Beyond Local Community' there are 'Two levels (e.g., larger chiefdoms) (.2)' of administrative control-Chiefs and Elders.

</p><p>Central authority rests with the King, but the role of sub-chiefs who complement the hierarchy have developed over time. <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-57"><a href="#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup>
</p><p>(1) King (Asantehene), the chief executive of the polity and occupant of the Golden Stool;
(2) Queen Mother (Asantehema), a mother's sister, grandmother, cousin or sister of the King and occupant of the Silver Stool, a Council of                     Elders from major lineages, and major officials of the capital, all of whom the Asantehene consulted with;
(3) chief executives of core provinces of the Ashanti Union (Omanhene);
(4) a corresponding structure of Ohema and a Council of Elders;
(5) Chiefs of lineages;
(6) councils of village leaders (mpanyinfo, odekro, obaapanyin)
</p><p>Arhin describes the power hierarchy from the village upwards: 'Female stools complemented the hierarchy of male stools. In the village the elders, mpanyinfo, heads of the matrilineages, who constituted with the odekro the village council, had their aberewa or obaapanyin, who looked after the women's affairs. The odekro had an obaapanyin who was responsible for the affairs of the women of the village and was a member of the village council; the ohene, head of a division, and the omanhene, head of the autonomous political community, had their female counterparts known as ohemma, female ruler, who sat on their councils. The ohene and the ohemma were all of the same mogya, blood, or clan. The Asantehemma, the occupant of the female stool of the Kumasi state, and therefore of united Asante, since her male counterpart was ex officio the Asantehene, king of Asante, was a member of the Kotoko council, the executive committee or cabinet of the Asanteman Nhyiamu, general assembly of Asante rulers.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-58"><a href="#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup> Major and minor chiefs were also summoned to council: 'Where the paramount King of a state summons the Head-Chiefs of provinces and chiefs of minor communities to attend a State Council, it is the privilege of the Councillors of the several communities composing the State, according to their rank and importance, to accompany their several Heads to the capital and to join in the “palaver,” or discussion, that will take place, the King in person presiding over the deliberations, supported by his own Councillors and principal Linguists. This is the full Parliament of the people, who are thus fully and duly represented in every way from the highest to the lowest. The commands which go forth from this assembly are binding upon every individual family of the entire State, from the most important province to the most insignificant hamlet, and the sanction operates equally upon all.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-59"><a href="#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup> The paramount executive authority was the Asantehene: 'The King is the Chief Executive Officer of the State, but not the Executive Council of the State. Such a council exists, and any acts done by the King without its concurrence are liable to be set aside.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-60"><a href="#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup> The attribution of concrete entities to a particular executive level is not always clear, though, especially in the early period: 'The state of the union that emerged after the War of Independence was obviously a very fluid one. The Asanteman is referred to as the  Asante Aman Nnum, the Five Asante States, but there is no clear consensus about which states comprised the original union. [...] The fact of the matter seems to have been that the coalition against the Denkyira included what were no more than “estates” on the one hand, like Bekwae, and what were established states on the other, like Mampon, Dwaben, and Kumase itself. Some were to decline and some were to prosper; some were to become powerful components of the Asanteman and some were to become little more than their clients.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-61"><a href="#cite_note-61">[61]</a></sup> On the executive level it therefore seems best to go with the stool system: 'Every Asante village was a microcosm of the Asante economic, social, and political universe. Its population included both rulers and ruled, both “owners” of the land with the right of succession to the local, divisional, and state stools and free men grouped in other lineages with corporate interests in other political offices.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-62"><a href="#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup> Only a few leaders in executive positions achieved the additional special status of Abrempon or 'big man': 'However many sikafo aspired to the award of the elephant tail, relatively few seem to have achieved it. Three successful nineteenth century claimants are well documented, namely, Gyaasewahene Opoku Frefre (died 1826), Ankobeahene Kwaku Tawia (died ca. 1850), and Manwerehene Kwasi Brantuo (died 1865). [...] I know of no female recipient of the honor. I do not think that women were disbarred by reason of their sex, rather that few if any achieved the necessary level of accumulation. [...] Those chiefs who were allowed to use elephant tails were called Abrempons. A chief who lives on his own land with his own subjects is known by the King as Abrempon.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-63"><a href="#cite_note-63">[63]</a></sup> The initiation required involved presentations of wealth as well as ritualized ceremonial. The Abrempon are excluded from the list above on the grounds of their precise position in the power hierarchy not being spelled out by the relevant sources.

(4) priests and healers associated with the commoner population and village shrines
</p><p>From the information gathered so far, we infer that organized religion shared some basic structural principles with the territorial and military organization. Some particularly powerful priests worked with the Asantehene himself, in organized ceremonial and military campaigns: 'Before a war senior servants of the Asantehene visited the shrines of major gods with gifts, to ask for guidance and support, and to promise rewards for success. They may also, of course, have received knowledge obtained by the webs of communication centred on the shrine. After successful campaigns, gods were rewarded with land and captives, large umbrellas and asipim chairs, and their priests given gold or silver crescent-shaped pendants to wear. Some priests and gods accompanied the armies, or missions, as in the case of the three priests in the retinue of General Akyeampon when he returned to the capital after negotiating in the south in the early 1870s.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-64"><a href="#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup> The practice was projected back to the times of Osei Tutu, but this may have had ideological reasons <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-65"><a href="#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup>. Major gods and their shrines produced offshoots in the form of minor deities and temples, both with their respective religious specialists: 'The god Tano has long enjoyed a particularly high place in the Asante pantheon. Thus in 1817 Bowdich remarked that “the present favourite fetish of Ashantee is that of the river Tando.” Such a god was divisible. Water and sediment might be transferred from the river to other locations and, provided this was done with all due ritual and honors, access to the god might be gained at them. Such local offshoots, the atano, were regarded as “children” of Tano and given a second name to distinguish each from the other, thus Taa (or Tano) Odomankoma, Taa Kora, Taa Bobodwo, Taa Kwadwo, Taa Yawo, Taa Mensa, and Taa Dwemo, to name but a few. An atano resided in a shrine, commonly a brass pan, which was housed in an abosomfie or temple protected and maintained by a custodian or bosomwura. Depending upon its prestige and wealth, the atano was served by a greater or lesser number of priests and priestesses - akomfo - who had been possessed by the god, and by such other attendants - atanokwaa - as cooks, musicians, umbrella carriers, and the like. Indeed, the temple of a powerful atano might, in terms of its personnel, closely resemble the court of a chief.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-66"><a href="#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup> Priests also participated in the organized ceremonial relevant to chiefs: 'Eto (mashed yams) are cooked once a year by the priests, and upon the day appointed (a Saturday) the chief will place a spoonful in the pan upon top of the forked branch, with the words: ‘Me Nyankopon me sere wo nkwa, na me sere wo ahooden’ (My God, I pray you for life and I pray you for strength). A sheep is also killed and the blood allowed to fall upon the ground [...].' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-67"><a href="#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup> The smallest shrines were associated with the village-level: 'Temples of gods ( bosom'dan, bosom'fie) were also often situated towards the edges of the village, although some were built well away from human habitation, usually on the banks of rivers or streams (from which gods were thought to come). In their simplest form the temples were small rectangular buildings, entered by steps, the outer surfaces decorated with low reliefs and covered with red and white clay. More usually they consisted of a number of units around a court. Here male priests would periodically carry the god's shrine on their heads, becoming possessed and showing their powers to see, say and do things beyond the abilities of ordinary mortals.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-68"><a href="#cite_note-68">[68]</a></sup>  Those priests 'combine with their office the cure of disease. Some of them are very good doctors and pull through cases where European skill has failed. They are skilled in the use of herbal remedies, and it might repay European medical men to study native therapeutics in its application to the treatment of diseases peculiar to the Gold Coast.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-69"><a href="#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup>

</p><p>'The King is the Chief Military Officer of his forces. In time of war, he directs the operations; and if he  is a man of capacity, he has the leading place in the councils of war. There is generally a Tufu Hin, or Captain-General, of the forces; but his authority is subordinate to that of the King, and he is, in every essential, an officer of the King.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-70"><a href="#cite_note-70">[70]</a></sup> According to Mensa-Bonsu, and in the early period at least, the Bantamahene filled this role, as described in the story of his oath: 'This account begins with the  Ntam of the  Bantamahene who is the  Adontenhene (Commander-in-Chief) of Asante. The  Ntam dates from the time of Osei Tutu. When Osei Tutu returned from his travels to succeed to the stool, his uncle Obiri Yeboa had just died. He felt he had to offer a sacrifice to his dead uncle to show his affection. He therefore chose his trusted friend Baafour Amankwatia, Chief of Bantama. Amankwatia had already been besmeared with redclay ready to be executed. Okomfo Anokye would not allow him to be killed and ordered his release. This occasion on which he nearly lost his life became a very serious event for the  Bantamahene. It thus became his  Ntam. Amankwatia lived to become one of Osei Tutu's greatest generals and won many wars for Asante.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-71"><a href="#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup> The head executives were assisted by a cadre of commanders and generals, who carried ceremonial swords as a sign of their special status and commanded particular armies and campaigns: 'A second class of sword, domfena, was carried by generals: ‘… a general is appointed to the command of an army, by receiving a gold-handled sword of the King's from his hand [...] The captains used these to swear before the King' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-72"><a href="#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup> There was a nucleus of armed professionals based in the capital: 'The local government of Kumasi was in the hands of the Kwaintsirs, a body of men who were the keepers of the golden stool. They formed the Department of War, and the great General Amankwatsia was formerly their Chief. The fact that the Department of War held in its keeping the royal stool illustrates vividly the origin of the kingly office in the Native State, which will be explained later on.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-73"><a href="#cite_note-73">[73]</a></sup> Most of the time, political and military hierarchies coincided, with leaders fulfilling a dual role: 'It has already been noted that among the Akan the military organisation was given in the political organisation. Political status determined military status. The commanders of the Asante army and its subdivisions were first elected as heads of territorial divisions or appointed as heads of palace associations and then assumed corresponding military positions: European visitors to the Akan states in the nineteenth century referred to the heads of the subdivisions as ‘captains’.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-74"><a href="#cite_note-74">[74]</a></sup> Finally, major and minor chiefs commanded their communities of citizen-soldiers in battle:'A chief is generally a captain of a company. In fact, every male member of the community is liable to military service in time of war, and during peace he has to drill every year with his company.  A fortiori, a chief is the natural leader of the men of his company. There are cases known, however, where civil chiefs hold no military command in their companies.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-75"><a href="#cite_note-75">[75]</a></sup>

They formed the Department of War, and the great General Amankwatsia was formerly their Chief. The fact that the Department of War held in its keeping the royal stool illustrates vividly the origin of the kingly office in the Native State, which will be explained later on.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-76"><a href="#cite_note-76">[76]</a></sup> The King was assisted in his military duties by secondary commanders and generals:'The King is the Chief Military Officer of his forces.

To avoid disputes, the several regiments parade through the town one after the other, pouring forth thunderous volleys from their long flint Dane guns. After the parade each regiment presents to the King its flags and emblems, new and old, as an act of homage, which the King returns with suitable words. The several Head-Chiefs next renew their allegiance to the King; and, after more dancing and popular rejoicing, thè King retires to his “compound,” where his vassals subsequently take leave of him, each vassal receiving a suitable present.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-78"><a href="#cite_note-78">[78]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Professional soldiers ♣ absent ♥ </b> Full-time specialists The Ashanti infantry mostly consisted of citizen-soldiers who were not specialists in their own right. There was also a nucleus of armed professionals not disbanded during times of peace, such as the standing body of the Ashanti Adontenhene: 'Bantama was, I am informed, chosen as the site of the royal mausoleum, and also of ‘the royal treasure-house of the ghosts’, because this place was the head-quarters of the Ashanti general and a standing body of about one thousand fighting-men. These served as a bodyguard of the skeletons and the treasure.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-79"><a href="#cite_note-79">[79]</a></sup> Given the general outlook of the Ashanti military, these should be classified as officers (above) rather than soldiers. According to Mensa-Bonsu, there were no professional soldiers: 'The army had four ‘wings’ - the Van, Rear, Left and Right wings ( Adonten, Kyidom, Benkum and  Nifa respectively). Every chief in Asante was a member of one of these ‘wings’. The ‘wing’ was under its own head who was in charge of maintaining discipline. The army had a commander-in-chief ( Krontihene). To date, when the chiefs sit in council, each chief joins the ‘wing’ to which he traditionally belonged. The fact of frequent wars notwithstanding, there were no professional fighters. Each man had his own occupation but could be called upon to fight any day.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-80"><a href="#cite_note-80">[80]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Professional priesthood ♣ present ♥ </b> Full-time specialists Priests occasionally left their homes and travelled to visit patients in other places, and formed a guild: 'When a priest is called in from a distance to attend a case, he will generally tell the friends of the patient much about the family history, and indicate that a deceased relative is troubling the patient for some act of disobedience. The deceased relative must accordingly be propitiated. How does he come to know the history of the family to which he is a stranger? There is a Guild of Priests in the country to which all Priests belong, whose members are absolutely faithful to one another.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-81"><a href="#cite_note-81">[81]</a></sup> They received specialist training: 'A Priest's training begins early in his life. He is generally sent away to another district to a seminary, where he serves out his apprenticeship, which may cover a period of three years. During that time he learns the use of herbs and their application to the cure of disease, at which he becomes very proficient in the course of after practice.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-82"><a href="#cite_note-82">[82]</a></sup> The period of initiation was concluded by a possession ritual and examination of sorts: 'After training, [he] was tested at a ritual attended by his teacher and all local priests. At this he was expected to become possessed, with the god's help to answer riddles or questions set by the other priests, and to divine successfully' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-83"><a href="#cite_note-83">[83]</a></sup> The long duration of apprenticeship, the existence of professional bodies and the involvement of priests in organized ceremonial indicate a degree of specialization. While the full-time status of lower-ranking local priests may be questionable, the head-priests employed in the centres of executive power should be defined as such.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bureaucracy_characteristics">Bureaucracy characteristics</span></h3>
<p><b> ♠ Full-time bureaucrats ♣ present ♥ </b> Full-time specialists The time period in question was characterized by a trend towards greater bureaucratization and functional specialization: 'State organisation became extremely complex in the Kumasi state because at the close of the 17th century it became the capital of the union of Asante states and, in the course of the following century, the seat of an empire which was roughly coterminous with the boundaries of modern Ghana and southeastern Ivory Coast (Wilks 1975: 374-86). The expansion of the state made necessary administrative reforms within Kumasi itself and for the maintenance of effective relations between the Asantehene, the head of the Asante Union and, by consent, also the head of the Kumasi state, and the heads of the conquered territories. The palace administration ( gyase) was expanded with appointive headships of innumerable functional units or palace associations ( afekuo, sing. fekuo) (Rattray 1929: 81-92; Wilks 1967: 214-28; Hagan 1971). The memberships of the palace associations, each of which had either military or nonmilitary functions, cut across the divisions, so that they formed checks on, and counterpoises to, the traditional power units. The heads of the most important of the palace associations, including the units assigned to the offspring of former and reigning Asantehene (Busia 1951: 95), were included in the state council. Since appointments to the headships of the palace associations were in the gift of the Asantehene, the administrative reform represented an intrusion of patrimonialism (Weber 1947: 347) into the traditional political organisation.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-84"><a href="#cite_note-84">[84]</a></sup> The purpose of this new administrative structure was to 'enforce subordination of the conquered rulers to the Asantehene. For this purpose the Asante kings used an administrative staff recruited from their gyase, household organization, consisting of units of functionaries with appointive headships [...] These palace associations, called afekuo (Reondorf, 1895: 119; Rattray, 1929: 91), were recruited from free attendants, warcaptives, purchased slaves (nnonkofo), and other bondsmen; in other words, persons connected by “ties of personal loyalty” (Weber, 1947: 342) to the various Asante Kings.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-85"><a href="#cite_note-85">[85]</a></sup> Senior public functionaries had a stool system of their own: 'In Kumasi proper there were seventy-seven stools, representing seventy-seven public functionaries, as, for example, the Bantuma Chief, or the Chief of the Royal Burial Grove, the Ateni Chief, or the Chief of the Lamplighters.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-86"><a href="#cite_note-86">[86]</a></sup> Some foreigners were employed in highly specialized roles: 'A form of treasury partly staffed by literate Muslims was created. Groups within the capital began to build up expertise in particular areas of administration and to concentrate on this as a way to power and wealth. Careers began to open for those with intelligence, negotiating skill and a steady nerve.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-87"><a href="#cite_note-87">[87]</a></sup>

Careers began to open for those with intelligence, negotiating skill and a steady nerve.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-88"><a href="#cite_note-88">[88]</a></sup> Given that their most important qualification seems to have been the command of foreign writing systems, they were probably not examined in a standardized manner by Ashanti superiors. Arhin's more conservative view of the emerging Ashanti administration (as compared to Wilks') seems to confirm this: 'But the household ( gyase) organization was bureaucratic only in the sense that the component units were assigned definite tasks around the King's person and at court. It was not a bureaucratic organization of the type associated with modern states, but patrimonialistic, an instrument of the extension of the King's personal authority.' (Yarak, 1983, 1984).' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-89"><a href="#cite_note-89">[89]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Merit promotion ♣ suspected unknown ♥ </b> 'The vast area brought under Asante control by force or threat of arms could not be governed unless new methods of controlling it were developed. From the 1760s, beginning under Asantehene Osei Kwadwo, various steps were taken to bring the control of outlying areas directly under Kumase [...] Senior officeholders in Kumase were placed in charge of particular areas of the administration, controlling considerable numbers of lesser officials. Some supervised the trade in ivory and kola, while others oversaw the gold-producing regions which now fell within the borders of Asante. A form of treasury partly staffed by literate Muslims was created. Groups within the capital began to build up expertise in particular areas of administration and to concentrate on this as a way to power and wealth. Careers began to open for those with intelligence, negotiating skill and a steady nerve.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-90"><a href="#cite_note-90">[90]</a></sup> 'Significant changes in Asante administrative practice, in the direction of increasing specialization of role, were attributed to Asantehene Osei Kwadwo (1764-1777). The class of administrators was a growing one, but I do not think we should yet speak of an administrative class emerging, one reproducing itself as a class.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-91"><a href="#cite_note-91">[91]</a></sup> This indicates that professional merit and expertise were important factors in the emerging bureucracy, but the sources make no mention of standardized procedures for promotion based on performance. The personal opinions of the Asantehene and other superior officials about the expertise of their inferiors seems paramount.

Writing about the pre-Ashanti period, Sarbah mentions urban storage facilities: 'On the 21st of February he sent one of his men with attendants to King Abaan, whose town was about four leagues up-country, where was stored a large quantity of corn and millet. This town is described to be as large as the London of that period. It was guarded every night, and to warn the watchmen, cords were stretched across the roads and paths leading to it. Attached to the cords were bells, which give the alarm. In addition to these cords, nets were hung over the few entrances, and were so contrived as to fall on any person endeavouring to steal into the town. Four hours after their arrival in the morning, these men were sent for by the king at nine o'clock, “for there may no man come to him before he be sent for,” nor was it customary in that country to offer their presents to the ruler until they had visited him thrice. On the last visit, after the king had accepted their presents, he drank palm-wine with them. The king, we are informed, used a cup of gold, and when he drank, the people cried all with one voice, “Abaan, Abaan,” with certain other words. “The king drinks; and when he had drunk, then they gave drink to every one, and that done, the king licensed them to depart; and every one that departeth from him boweth three times towards him, and waveth with both hands together, as they bow and do depart. The king hath commonly sitting by him eight or ten ancient men with grey beards.”' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-100"><a href="#cite_note-100">[100]</a></sup> Sarbah also speaks of quasi-feudal arragements in some Akan polities prior to Ashanti rule: 'In the Fanti system allegiance is personal, but in the Asanti it is personal and territorial combined. ‡ The head ruler is not necessarily the owner of any land in his jurisdiction; e.g., Ohene Tchibu, of Asin Yankumasi, owns no land, and is a tenant of Abesibro, his captain; so also is Ohene Aka Ayima, of Beyin in Appolonia, by the [Page 25] judgment of Mr. Justice Nicoll, declared to own no land in his district-at least he did not lead evidence to show the land in question was his. In the case of Ohene Tchibu, the explanation is, that his ancestors fled to Fantiland for protection from the north side of the Pra in the kingdom of Asanti. The greater part of the Asinfu settled on lands within the jurisdiction of the head ruler of Abura, who became their feudal superior. * Many of the Asinfu continued to work on their lands across the river Pra, and held them. Among such is Akessi of Fumsu, until, by an order of the Executive Council of Gold Coast, an arbitrary boundary was fixed, and the possessions of the Asinfu, Denkerafu, and others, trans-Pra and trans-Ofin, were declared Asanti territory in the district of Adansi, and this in spite of the fact that Yamsu village, the stool of which was the subject of the case, Ghambra v. Ewea, † is situate on the Adansi side of the Ofin.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-101"><a href="#cite_note-101">[101]</a></sup> We have assumed this to be true of the Ashanti period as well, given the cultivation of plantations around towns housing rulers and other elites.</dd></dl>

'A full history of the great-roads ( nkwantεmpon) of Asante has yet to be written. Rather more is known about the southern routes than the northern, since European merchants on the Gold Coast were keenly interested in the matter and made many relevant entries in their journals. Yarak has suggested that the roads from Kumase to Axim via Denkyera, Wasa and Aowin, and from Kumase to Elmina via Denkyera and Twifo, were already in use in the first decade of the eighteenth century. Security was a constant problem on both. L. F. Rømer, a Danish factor on the eastern Gold Coast in the 1730s and 1740s, commented on the matter. In the mid-1740s he thought it likely that, because of marauding, the Asante ‘will create another road to the western forts on the seacoast’. He was later to report that this happened. ‘They have got a road open,’ he wrote, ‘from their country to Elmine [Elmina], Cap Cors [Cape Coast], and the forts which lie west of Elmine.’ It may be that this was the great-road via Asen and the Fante country to Anomabo, whence it was a short journey along the beach to the headquarters of the British at Cape Coast and of the Dutch at Elmina. If so, the Dutch could have regarded it as no more than a temporary solution to their problem of communications with Kumase.

Indeed, referring admittedly to the last quarter of the century, Arhin's informants in Kintampo described the acquisition of pawns as the quickest way to accumulate labour in order to expand one's harvest of kola, which was in turn reinvested in slaves further to reinforce the labour force. In 1898 the importance of slaves in the kola industry was such that Richard Austin Freeman predicted that ‘On the abolition of domestic slavery the kola industry in Ashanti will tend to die out’. Regarding gold mining, Dumett has noted, for the Akan states generally, that the family labour unit included some slaves. Indeed, we may assume that any commoner wishing to increase output beyond the capacity of the conjugal family workforce needed to use slaves or pawns. As Garrard has demonstrated, the average returns on gold digging and panning were low, almost certainly too low to make it profitable to use wage labour.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-103"><a href="#cite_note-103">[103]</a></sup></dd></dl>

Adinkra are used extensively in fabrics, pottery, logos and advertising. They are incorporated into walls and other architectural features. Fabric adinkra are often made by woodcut sign writing as well as screen printing. Adinkra symbols appear on some traditional akan gold weights. The symbols are also carved on stools for domestic and ritual use. [...] Akan oral tradition dates the arrival of adinkra among the Akan to the end of the 1818 Asante-Gyaman War. However, the Englishman Thomas Edward Bowdich collected a piece of adinkra cloth in 1817, which demonstrates that adinkra art existed before the traditional starting date.[2] Bowdich obtained this cotton cloth in Kumasi, a city in south-central Ghana.

<dd><b> ♠ Tokens ♣ present ♥ </b> ‘Tramma means literally cowries, the small shells from the Indian Ocean which, by the route from the north, found their way all over West Africa, and to this day may be seen used for small change in the native markets. The word came to be applied to a sale of movable or immovable property in the following manner. No contract of sale was valid in olden times unless a payment called tramma had been made. Tramma was the name derived from that sum, additional to the selling price, which was set aside and given to the witnesses of the transaction. It was a fixed proportional amount, and, at least for certain specified articles, seemed uniform, e.g. the tramma on the purchase of a cat-the old Ashanti bought cats as repositories of their okra or breath-was always a pesewa, about 1 d.; for a female slave, ntaku-anan, about 2 s.; for a male slave, ntakumiensa, [Page 235] 1 s. 6 d. In the case of such purchases no part of the tramma could be used by vendor or purchaser, and it was said that if a purchaser used any of it to buy food with it for his purchase, the slave or cat would die. This tramma may perhaps be called ‘earnest money’, but it was not originally paid to the vendor. If the transaction was afterwards repudiated, the receivers of the tramma were the witnesses to vouch for the transaction. The word therefore came to be used to designate a sale outright as opposed to awowa, ‘pledge’, or in case of land, ‘mortgage’.’ <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-125"><a href="#cite_note-125">[125]</a></sup> According to SCCS variable 17 'Money (Media of Exchange) and Credit' 'Tokens of conventional value as media of exchange' were used, not 'No media of exchange or money' or 'Domestically used articles as media of exchange' or 'Foreign coinage or paper coinage', or 'Indigenous coinage or paper currency'.</dd>

When a mission was despatched to Cape Coast in 1872, it was reported that the Asantehene ‘fixed the ambassadors 20 days to and fro’. It was, then, the regulated movement of couriers along the roads, rather than that of soldiers or traders, which provided the Asante with a notion of a standard speed.

Barkcloth was also worn by the Asantehene during part of the Odwira festival.

<dd><b> ♠ Leather, cloth ♣ inferred present ♥ </b> War garments made of cloth fulfilled a primarily talismanic function and do not constitute armor in the conventional sense of the term: 'The custom of wearing talismanic war garments was well established by the nineteenth century, and some were worn with other northern appurtenances. ‘Their vest was of red cloth, covered with fetishes and saphies in gold and silver; and embroidered cases of almost every colour, which flapped against their bodies as they moved, intermixed with small brass bells, the horns and tails of animals, shells, and knives; long leopards tails hung down their backs, over a small bow covered with fetishes. They wore loose cotton trowsers [ sic], with immense boots of a dull red leather, coming half way up the thigh, and fastened by small chains to their cartouch or waist belt; these were also ornamented with bells, horses tails, strings of amulets, and innumerable shreds of leather; a small quiver of poisoned arrows hung from their right wrist, and they held a long iron chain between their teeth, with a scrap of Moorish writing affixed to the end of it.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-149"><a href="#cite_note-149">[149]</a></sup> This was apparently true of many head-coverings as well. Military head-coverings used by leaders offered mystical protection and should not be characterized as helmets in the conventional sense of the term: 'These smocks were usually worn with a talisman-covered cap, and sometimes with additional protective asuma[unknown] hung around the neck.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-150"><a href="#cite_note-150">[150]</a></sup> Elaborate talismanic garments were worn by military leaders but not commoners. But Sarbah reports leather helmets: "Ansa the king appeared in full state, accompanied by a large retinue. Before him went his men sounding trumpets and horns, carrying tinkling bells, and playing various kinds of drums, as well as other instruments, which were quite new to the Portuguese. His Gyasi men, that is, bodyguard, were armed with spears, javelins, shields, bows and arrows; on their heads they wore a sort of helmet made of skins thickly studded with shark's teeth, the same kind of helmets one sees whenever a town company turns out in fighting attire, and as they came with their lord and master, they sang their popular martial airs.

These smocks were usually worn with a talisman-covered cap, and sometimes with additional protective asuma[unknown] hung around the neck.

<dd><b>♠ Impeachment ♣ present ♥</b> Chiefs could be destooled when found incompetent or cruel: 'The Ashanti had a constitutional practice which ensured that the will of the people was given consideration. They had ultimately the constitutional right to destool a chief. As the fundamental principle was that only those who elected a chief could destool him, a destoolment required the consent of the elders. Sometimes they initiated a destoolment themselves when, for example, a chief repeatedly rejected their advice, or when he broke a taboo, or committed a sacrilegious act. The kind of offences for which chiefs were destooled may be gathered from the following instances of destoolments recounted in the traditional histories of the Divisions.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-165"><a href="#cite_note-165">[165]</a></sup> 'Chiefs Kwabena Aboagye of Asumegya, Kwabena Bruku, and Kwasi Ten of Nsuta were destooled for drunkenness; Kwame Asonane of Bekwai for being a glutton ( adidifurum); Kwame Asona, also of Bekwai, for dealing in charms and noxious medicines; and Akuamoa Panyin of Juaben for his abusive tongue, and [Page 22] for not following the advice of his elders. In Kokofu, Osei Yaw was destooled for being fond of disclosing the origin of his subjects (i.e. reproaching them with their slave ancestry), and Mensa Bonsu for excessive cruelty.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-166"><a href="#cite_note-166">[166]</a></sup> 'A chief was also destooled if he became blind, or impotent, or suffered from leprosy, madness, or fits, or if his body was maimed in a way that disfigured him.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-167"><a href="#cite_note-167">[167]</a></sup> According to Danquah, destoolments became more common in the colonial period: 'THE terms “enstoolment” and “destoolment” are used in the Gold Coast to indicate, as to enstoolment (1) the customary procedure of electing and installing a member of the stool family as Chief or King of the tribe or nation over which that stool rules, and, as to destoolment, (2) the converse procedure of deposing a reigning Chief or King from his former position as ruler. Owing to the importance attached to the hereditary position of Chief either as Odikro (Chief of a town), or Ohene (Chief of a sub-divisional state), there has (Paramount Chief of an independent state), there has been much litigation in recent times in connexion with disputes on the legality or otherwise of particular Enstoolments or Destoolments, and instances are not wanting of such disputes passing through the African and British Courts in the Colony to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in England.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-168"><a href="#cite_note-168">[168]</a></sup> 'Many are the causes which have given rise to such frequent disputes, but to examine such causes is not the object of this article, our purpose in writing which is more theoretical than practical. Enstoolment used to be a peaceful and dignified procedure. But the frequency of modern disputed elections has changed the peace and dignity which used to attend the ancient mode of making the best men of the tribe King or ruler.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-169"><a href="#cite_note-169">[169]</a></sup> 'Many political theorists versed in the craft have traced the cause of this frequent deposition of Chiefs to the effects of the Native Jurisdiction Ordinances. We are not prepared to deny or accept this view, but we are inclined to think that the present discontent among the mass of the people against the ruling houses must have one cause in the general administration of affairs, and another in the irreconciled differences existing between the old system of government and the form of government which seems to be demanded by the present generation. However much we may admire the Akan institutions, we should not be doing our duty for the effective maintenance of the best that should be preserved in our institutions were we to suffer both Ormuzd and Ahriman [Page 110] to grow strong together. Where an existing order leads to creation of disorder nothing but a reform of the former would lead to a cessation of the latter.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-170"><a href="#cite_note-170">[170]</a></sup> 'We are not, however, concerned in this treatise with debatable political considerations, and having stated a sufficient preamble for the present subject, we proceed to discuss it so far as present limitations will permit.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-171"><a href="#cite_note-171">[171]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<p><b>♠ Rulers are legitimated by gods ♣ present ♥</b> Arhin describes the power hierarchy from the village upwards: 'Female stools complemented the hierarchy of male stools. In the village the elders, mpanyinfo, heads of the matrilineages, who constituted with the odekro the village council, had their aberewa or obaapanyin, who looked after the women's affairs. The odekro had an obaapanyin who was responsible for the affairs of the women of the village and was a member of the village council; the ohene, head of a division, and the omanhene, head of the autonomous political community, had their female counterparts known as ohemma, female ruler, who sat on their councils. The ohene and the ohemma were all of the same mogya, blood, or clan. The Asantehemma, the occupant of the female stool of the Kumasi state, and therefore of united Asante, since her male counterpart was ex officio the Asantehene, king of Asante, was a member of the Kotoko council, the executive committee or cabinet of the Asanteman Nhyiamu, general assembly of Asante rulers.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-172"><a href="#cite_note-172">[172]</a></sup> Major and minor chiefs were also summoned to council: 'Where the paramount King of a state summons the Head-Chiefs of provinces and chiefs of minor communities to attend a State Council, it is the privilege of the Councillors of the several communities composing the State, according to their rank and importance, to accompany their several Heads to the capital and to join in the “palaver,” or discussion, that will take place, the King in person presiding over the deliberations, supported by his own Councillors and principal Linguists. This is the full Parliament of the people, who are thus fully and duly represented in every way from the highest to the lowest. The commands which go forth from this assembly are binding upon every individual family of the entire State, from the most important province to the most insignificant hamlet, and the sanction operates equally upon all.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-173"><a href="#cite_note-173">[173]</a></sup> The paramount executive authority was the Asantehene: 'The King is the Chief Executive Officer of the State, but not the Executive Council of the State. Such a council exists, and any acts done by the King without its concurrence are liable to be set aside.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-174"><a href="#cite_note-174">[174]</a></sup> The attribution of concrete entities to a particular executive level is not always clear, though, especially in the early period: 'The state of the union that emerged after the War of Independence was obviously a very fluid one. The Asanteman is referred to as the  Asante Aman Nnum, the Five Asante States, but there is no clear consensus about which states comprised the original union. [...] The fact of the matter seems to have been that the coalition against the Denkyira included what were no more than “estates” on the one hand, like Bekwae, and what were established states on the other, like Mampon, Dwaben, and Kumase itself. Some were to decline and some were to prosper; some were to become powerful components of the Asanteman and some were to become little more than their clients.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-175"><a href="#cite_note-175">[175]</a></sup> Government was organized in a system of stools: 'Every Asante village was a microcosm of the Asante economic, social, and political universe. Its population included both rulers and ruled, both “owners” of the land with the right of succession to the local, divisional, and state stools and free men grouped in other lineages with corporate interests in other political offices.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-176"><a href="#cite_note-176">[176]</a></sup> Chiefship had a sacred character as rulers were thought to have a special connection to the ancestors: 'Chiefship in Ashanti is a sacred office. This has been shown by the rites of the chief's enstoolment and by his part in ceremonies such as have been described. As long as he sits upon the stool of [Page 37] the ancestors his person is sacred. As the successor of the ancestors he performed various rites for the welfare of his people. With that office were joined other functions which may be described as administrative, executive, judicial, and military. If he abused his power, he was divested of it by having his special connexion with his ancestors, established on his enstoolment, severed. This happened when he committed or was made to commit one of the tabooed acts. His sanctity was violated and he was no longer able to sit on the stool of the ancestors. Thus, the Ashanti destool a chief by bumping his buttocks on the ground, or taking his sandals off his feet, or by mutilating his body. After such an act the chief was no longer in special contact with the ancestors, and having lost his sanctity he became automatically divested of all the other functions pertaining to the office of chiefship.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-177"><a href="#cite_note-177">[177]</a></sup>

A union or company of men banded together under a leader, chosen from among their number by popular vote, to compel the recognition of a real or imaginary grievance or to further some plan, good or perhaps bad, upon which all are of one mind; or perhaps again, merely for the purpose of joining together to work in turns for each other, say at cultivating or clearing a plantation.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-178"><a href="#cite_note-178">[178]</a></sup> 'These companies or confederations adopt a leader, as already [Page 46] stated, and assume an emblem or flag, and the confederation is given a name, generally one explaining the raison d'être for the amalgamation. The following are a few examples of ‘company’ names.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-179"><a href="#cite_note-179">[179]</a></sup> 'IF one had to make a choice between a purely social as distinguished from a political institution in the Akan state system it would be difficult to point to a characteristic mark by which to differentiate between the two. “Society” at the stage in which we are studying it among the Akan peoples is not far removed from the idea of association of families, clans, or tribes. Invariably the head of the family is not only the patriarch but also the social leader of that family or clan. Matches between marriageable youths are contracted under his personal advice; free consent of girl or boy to a marriage is only conditional on the sanction of the head of family. Dances are usually held within the family compound and when the youth of two or more families meet for some social purpose they do so under the aegis of the central head of those families. Society is more or less clannish in structure, and in proportion as the family tie is close, the youth of the family or tribe are constrained to model their social intercourse on the structure of the political or tribal units. Thus then starting from the highest structure in the State with the Omanhene as its head, we meet a descending scale of social institutions having some head or other who partakes of the hierarchy inherent in the supreme head. The town with a Chief or Odikro as political head has also a corresponding head for the social activities of the town. This head is directly under the Odikro or Chief, but in so far as members of his association are concerned, he is supreme as supremacy goes in the Akan institutional regime. There are several such institutions in every Akan state, and almost every town in an Akan state has a social association of young men with their own leaders called captains (Asafohene or Asafoatse) and lieutenants (Sripi). These Asafo companies as they are called have very definite functions in the political and social community wherein they are found, and as the host (Asafo) of all the young men in a town or state, they were in historical times the only disciplined association [Page 225] of able-bodied men who fought their country's battles in time of war and did yeoman service in time of peace.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-180"><a href="#cite_note-180">[180]</a></sup> 'Thus, then, these Asafo Companies of young men are established with very different and diverse purposes, and their activities in recent years have given cause to much controversy as to whether they should be regarded as indispensable parts of the Akan constitution, or whether they are mere associations of young men working for their own immediate benefit and enjoyment. At one time, the rivalry between the different companies, the so-called “company fights”, became so serious that Government had to institute inquiries into the origin, constitution, and status of the Company System. The result of these inquiries did not make the contemplated abolition of the system necessary or practicable, and, for sociological purposes, the value of such associations admits of no cursory treatment.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-181"><a href="#cite_note-181">[181]</a></sup> 'Mr. Casely Hayford deals with the Company System in his Native Institutions, but apparently he has in mind the relation between an Asafo Company and the Chief of a town or division, or between the Government and the Company System. He does not, however, lose sight of the fact that the Asafo Companies are the backbone of the country. Such a company in a town consists really of the whole male inhabitants of a town or village, exclusive only of boys under sixteen or seventeen, and of the Councillors in a Chief's Tribunal. They form a strong body of commons who, besides other duties, have also a distinct voice in the enstoolment or destoolment of local Chiefs. Without them, the governments of the Akan nations would not have that glamour of liberal sanction which makes the government of any free people at once orderly and democratic.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-182"><a href="#cite_note-182">[182]</a></sup> 'The Asafo Companies have assumed different forms in successive ages. First there is the company which for services rendered to the town or country in time of war or of peace, has been raised to a status which entitles it to participate in the direct government of the town or country. This is effected by making the Company's captain or leader a Captain-on-Stool ( Okonnuasoni). It should be observed that captains of Asafo companies have, as a fact, no stools, and until a Company captain is created as a stool-holding captain, the succession to the captaincy is always made by vote of the members. In the old days companies were usually formed not by the admixture of different members of various families, as is the case at present, but by a collection of the members of a single family, primarily for [Page 226] defensive and offensive purposes. This class of Asafo Companies is now extinct. They have all of them obtained statutory right to partake in the direct government of the town or country to which they belong.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-183"><a href="#cite_note-183">[183]</a></sup> 'The form of the institution now in vogue consists of the young men of a town who have brought themselves together for social intercourse, and for the purpose of devoloping a unified national spirit.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-184"><a href="#cite_note-184">[184]</a></sup> We are unsure whether the activities performed by companies count as public goods.</dd></dl>
