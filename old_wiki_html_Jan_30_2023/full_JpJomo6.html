<p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of equality ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> "Several ethnographic accounts of the native peoples of the northwest coast of North America report the existence of a class of person described as slaves, suggesting a high degree of social differentiation. In many ways, the cultures of the northwest coast were comparable to the Jomon culturees, especially of eastern Japan. Just like the Jomon people, they had no agriculture, but differences in personal status developed, supported by a fishing, hunting and gathering economy. Is there any reason why similar status distinctions should not have developed within Jomon Japan, where economic conditions similar to those on the northwest coast prevailed? The high degree of organisational potential exhibited by Jomon societies, exemplified by the construction of large-scale features such as the ditch at Shizukawa, and the strength of what we might call Jomon cultural power, certainly provided the conditions for the appearance of a degree of social ranking and the accrual of individual status differences within the framework of Jomon society.//For example, in the middle of a community cemetery at the Late Jomon Yamaga shell midden in Fukuoka Prefecture, lies a woman with twenty shell armlets on her wrists [...]. Because of their fragility, she would not have been able to undertake any serious everyday work without considerable inconvenience. We should consider this woman as being of high status who avoided any manual labour. It is possible, although we have no evidence for this, that labour was undertaken for her by slaves. In addition, a man buried with a pattern-engraved deer antler hip ornament may also have been a person of high status. Watanabe Hitoshi pioneered discussions of the existence of stratification in Jomon society, and was supported by the eminent archaeologist Sahara Makoto in the view that social differences in the Jomon were institutionalised. Thinking this way, it is possible to interpret examples of adult women being buried with a slave who was responsible for seeing the child safely to the other world. Perhaps the tradition which includes the slaves described as attending and protecting the mythical Queen Himiko in the Yayoi period extends back deep in time to the Jomon.//There is one more component to the story of personal ranking; ear ornaments. Appearing around the end of the Initial Jomon and the beginning of the Early Jomon, these distinctive artefacts are suddenly found all over the archipelago. Although the distribution of these objects is very widespread, the numbers of ear ornaments from any particular site are very few. Typically less than one-tenth of burials from Jomon community cemeteries have earrings, and it seems that only certain people within these communities were allowed to wear them. Perhaps these people belonged to an elite class, at the top of the hierarchical social order, above ordinary people who in turn had more social status than our postulated slaves, who made up the lowest Jomon social group. Jomon archaeology continues to produce surprises, though, such as the recent excavations at Kuwano, a community cemetery in Fukui Prefecture, where many of the graves contained slit-stone earrings, a timely reminder that we need to be cautious in our interpretations regarding the precise nature of Jomon society, and that we are well-advised to keep an open mind on the social significance of particular types of artefact." <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-51"><a href="#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup>
