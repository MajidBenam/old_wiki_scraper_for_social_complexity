In1640, at his instigation, an assembly was convened of Oirat, Khalkha, Koko Nor and Kalmuk rulers and representatives of the high clergy, at which the Oirat Mongol Legal Code was drafted and enacted, under which all were urged to consolidate their own internal position and to pool their efforts in order to resist the Manchus. However, fragmented as they were, the Mongols found these measures extremely difficult to carry out in practice. <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="General_Description">General Description</span></h4>
<p>The Zungharian polity was, according to Atwood,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> "the last great independent power of the steppe". The tribal name "Zunghar" first appeared in the seventeenth century, as part of the Oirat confederation of steppe tribes; their rise to dominance within the confederation began under the leadership of Khara-Khula (d. 1634), but it was only in the 1670s, under Galdan, that they officially became the confederacy's leading tribe, and recognised as such even by the Dail Lama, who gave Galdan the title of Boshogtu Khan.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-9"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> At its height, the Zungharian polity included portions of Central Asia, Kazakhstan, western Mongolia, neighbouring areas of southern Siberia, and Xinjiang.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> In 1755, the Qing empire was able to annex the Zungharians following a relatively quick and bloodless military campaign; because the Zungharians had successfully repelled the Chinese army several times before, the cause for this sudden collapse can most likely be found in the conflict between the successors of the last great Zugharian ruler, Galdan-Tseren (d. 1735).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>
</p><p><i>Population and political organization</i>
</p><p>The Zungharian ruler, known as Khung-Taiji, benefited from the support of an office (yamu) or court (zarghu) composed of four chief officials, known as ministers (tüshimed), judges (zarghuchis), or grand councillors (zaisangs). Galdan-Tseren, the only Zungharian ruler to also be known by the title of Khan, added six additional councillors. Each of the tribes that made up the Zungharian-led confederacy (previously known as the Oirat confederacy) and its own ruler who was himself supported by his own councillors, as well as minor functionaries such as standard-bearers and trumpeters. Finally, each tribe was itself subdivided into otogs, which were themselves subdivided into smaller units (of 40 and then 20 households) governed by local commoner officials.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-12"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>
</p><p>Sources say that the Zungharian polity included "200,000 households";<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-13"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> with a conservative estimate of 3-8 people per household, the population would therefore have been in the range of 600,000-1,600,000 people.

</p><p>Perdue's map <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-18"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> indicates the presence of regional capitals and towns; however these probably corresponded to the Chinese administration.
Erdeni Batur had built a capital for the Zunghars at Kubak Zar near Tashkent but it fell into disuse after his death (before the start of our polity) <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-19"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>
Zunghar farms are also mentioned <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-20"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup>
From this we can infer at least two levels, towns and villages/farms, even though this society was nomadic.

</p><p>"Those Oirats who stayed in Jungaria, led by the Choros under their khan Baatur-Khongtaiji (1634-53), consolidated their hold on the area, symbolizing this by stabilizing their headquarters in the form of a city which became the modern Chuguchak (Tacheng)." <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-22"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>

<p>"While often called the “Zunghar Khanate,” the Zünghar ruler bore the title of khan only rarely. Instead, the Zünghar ruler bore the title of Khung-Taiji, a title derived from Chinese huang-taizi, “crown prince” and originally meaning viceroy or regent for the khan. The title of khan was taken later, if at all, and only by special grant from an outside power, such as the Dalai Lama. While Galdan held the title of khan, his nephew and successor Tse- wang-Rabtan was merely Khung-Taiji. GALDAN-TSEREN (r. 1727-45) is usually called khan, but it is unclear from whom he received the title." <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-23"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>
</p><p>"Galdan-Tseren reorganized the Zünghar principality, nominally numbering 200,000 households, into directly ruled otogs and appanages, or anggis. His directly subject households, nomadizing in the Ili valley, numbered 24 otogs administered by 54 albachi zaisang (tax officials), with a nominal strength of 87,300 households. These were his personal Choros subjects, captured Siberian and Mongolian peoples, and functional units such as the 4,000 Kötöchi-Nar (equerries), 1,000 Buuchin (musketeers), 5,000 Uruud (craftsmen), and 2,000 ZAKHACHINs (borderers). The appanages of the great nobles, which surrounded the Ili center, were arranged into 21 anggis, specified as six Choros, one Khoshud, two Torghud, eight Khoid, and (presumably) four Dörböd.

Instead, the Zünghar ruler bore the title of Khung-Taiji, a title derived from Chinese huang-taizi, “crown prince” and originally meaning viceroy or regent for the khan. The title of khan was taken later, if at all, and only by special grant from an outside power, such as the Dalai Lama. While Galdan held the title of khan, his nephew and successor Tse- wang-Rabtan was merely Khung-Taiji.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Religion_and_Normative_Ideology">Religion and Normative Ideology</span></h2>
<p>We are interested here in any systems of thought and behavior that can influence people's actions, which we term a <i>Normative Ideology</i>.  Normative ideologies are thought-systems concerned with the correct behavior of people, governments/leaders, and other groups (and particularly the relationships between these groups).
</p><p>Mainly, this will be a religious or ritual system. As usual, when we mention Religious or Ritual System our focus  is on the 'official cult', defined the same way as in the Rituals section:
</p>
<dl><dd>With the official cult we refer to the set of collective religious practices that are most closely associated with legitimation of the power structure (including elites, if any).</dd></dl>
<p>However, Normative Ideologies are not restricted to religious/ritual systems. They include other thought systems, such as philosophy or anything that prescribes a particular pattern of behaviour. An example is  classical Greek philosophy, such as the works of Plato and Aristotle, who were concerned with correct or moral behaviour and whose thoughts influenced the actual practice of several societies (the empire of Alexander the Great, notably).

If we take care of our own spiritual development, we render a service to others; and if we develop love towards others, we thereby also help ourselves. Accordingly, it is explicitly stated, someone who pursues the path of salvation only for his or her own benefit is to be censured, while the one who follows the path for one’s own benefit and for the benefit of others is to be commended (see AN 7:64).' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-83"><a href="#cite_note-83">[83]</a></sup> 'Three segments of the Noble Eightfold Path (3 - 5) are traditionally subsumed under the principle of morality (sila): ‘right speech’ (3), ‘right action’ (4) and ‘right livelihood’ (5).

From monks and nuns complete sexual abstention is demanded. ‘Right livelihood’ means abstaining from those sources of income which involve harming other beings: trading in weapons for instance, or trading in living beings, meat, intoxicants or poison; also included is the avoidance of fraud and avarice.' <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-84"><a href="#cite_note-84">[84]</a></sup>
