<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="General_Description">General Description</span></h4>
<p>The eleventh century BCE marks the beginning of radical changes in southern Greece generally as well as Crete specifically, largely resulting from the invasion from the North of the Dorians<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> Overall, however, this period is relatively poorly understood, with no written sources and few archaeological finds. Most likely, Cretans mainly dedicated themselves to farming and pastoralism. Writing disappeared and artistic expression became more abstracted and geometrical. Things started to change in the eighth century, when trade routes were revitalized, and Cretans were able to capitalize on the island's premier location in the Eastern Mediterranean. And the trade in artefacts and products was accompanied by the exchange of new ideas and technologies. <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p><i>Population and political organization</i>
</p><p>Not much is known about either the island's population numbers at the time, or its political organization. In terms of population, very few settlements have been excavated, and none of these have yielded enough data for a credible estimate; in terms of political organization, it is likely that elite families were in charge but not much else could be said.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

</p><p><b> ♠ Polity Population ♣ suspected unknown ♥ </b> People. Very few settlements have been actually been excavated and not with nearly the horizontal sample that we should need to be able to address questions of population estimates.
</p><p><b> ♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ 6000 ♥ </b> Inhabitants. The largest settlement of the period is Knossos and its population is estimated to about 6,000 individuals. <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

<p><b> ♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣[1-3]♥ </b> levels. Excavation data and survey information is very limited (especially for the 10th and 9th centuries BCE). <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> A large settlement was the center of a sparsely populated territory. Each regional landscape was organized for maximum exploitation of local resources and maximum security.  This large center might represent the first synoecism of local population which will led to the emergence, during the late 8th and early 7th centuries BCE, of small city-states. Interdependence and economic and social cooperation between sites is assumed because of topographic isolation and shared water supplies, agricultural land, and pasture. <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Administrative levels ♣ suspected unknown ♥ </b> levels. There is no evidence for the administrative organization of Cretan communities. Members of local elite families might controlled the administrative sector of the large settlements that arose in Crete during the period. During the Archaic period (710-500 BCE),  political, military and religious control was exercised by the <i>Kosmoi</i>, a board of 3 to 10 nobles annually elected by the <i>Ecclesia</i>, the body of free male citizens.  It is very likely that some aspects of this organization existed since the 8th century BCE. <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Rulers are legitimated by gods ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Use of expensive, conspicuous items such as bronze shields and tripods as votive offerings at important sanctuaries suggests that elites intended to gain legitimacy by signalling a special relation with the gods. "The military-aristocratic connotations of the dedicated shields speak for themselves. The possession of this kind of armor, often elaborately decorated, was clearly the reserve of an elite. Bronze shields and other weaponry occur as grave offerings in rich Cretan tombs from the late ninth to the seventh century bc and would have articulated the deceased’s role as warrior and leading member of the developing aristocracy. The dedication of such objects in sanctuaries would have had a similar function, but added an element of greater visibility and permanency. Precious votives could remain on display for generations, as attested by ancient authors such as Pausanias. He mentions seeing such votives and being told that these were of great antiquity and offered by famous rulers (e.g. Paus, III.2.8, III.3.8.,V.19.6). Clearly, the religious dedication of precious objects implied special relations with higher powers. Like a claim to military prowess, this relationship enhanced a donor’s position in the community and would have been considered as more than worth the expense.//The bronze tripod-cauldrons, though lacking the overt military connotations of the shields, were no less tied to the aristocratic ethos. An indication of their value may be gained from the Homeric epics, in which they constitute the most prestigious gift exchanged between fellow aristocrats. In a passage of the Iliad (23.703-5), a tripod is estimated to have a value of twelve oxen, whereas a skilled, female slave is considered to be worth only four. O. Murray (1983) has argued that the special meaning of bronze tripod-cauldrons in early Greek times derived from their use as cooking vessels at communal dining parties. Drawing on anthropological parallels and the Homeric epics, Murray describes these as competitive, ritualized affairs, in which the leading members of society would try to outdo each other in generosity, including the provision of vast quantities of food. Tripod-cauldrons would thus have developed into symbols of the owner’s wealth and - no less importantly - of the ability to feed, sustain and organize a group of followers. As pointed out by W. Burkert, bronze cauldrons were also the ideal vessel in which to boil the parts of the sacrificial meat that were not roasted. Their frequent setting up in sanctuaries may have been a way of “giving permanence to the sacrificial act” (Burkert 1985:93)." <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-24"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>
