It consisted of 4,200 infantry (5,000 in times of emergency), subdivided into units of 120 or 60 men called maniples ('handfuls'), and so modern scholars often refer to it as the 'manipular' legion, to distinguish it from later legions organized in larger subunits called cohorts." "It perhaps emerged in the 4th century BC (as Livy suggests), due to problems the Romans encountered fighting against enemies who fought in looser formations than the phalanx and in rougher terrain, to which the phalanx was unsuited."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_63_ItRomER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]1.

There were, however, professional junior officers at least from the Roman Principate.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Typically the men who commanded armies and legions were senators. There were no military specialists in Roman government and no imperial high command. All senators alternated brief periods of military command with administrative posts, participation in domestic politics and careers as legal advocates. As military commanders they were, to a great extent, amateurs, even though most did a brief spell as a junior officer (tribune) in a legion.

For the same reason it is widely agreed that pay was introduced due to prolonged campaigns "from the later fourth century onwards, during the wars against the Samnites, the Etruscans, and Gauls." The tributum tax, which is mentioned "from roughly 400 BC onwards" is thought to have been introduced for citizens to pay for soldiers. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_74_ItRomER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Professional soldiers were certainly present from the beginning of the Roman Principate. "Augustus' main military reforms had the effect of turning the army into a standing force of long-service professionals, instead of the part-time citizen force of the Republic."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_75_ItRomER] It is also argued that a professional corps developed from the reforms of Marius in 105 BCE. Some further maintain that the pre-existing citizen militia was "essentially professional" by 220 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_76_ItRomER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/><b>♠ Professional priesthood ♣ present ♥</b>"Rome had no full-time male priests, but the Vestals were supported by the state and were full-time professional clergy, along with the priestess of Ceres and Proserpina." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_77_ItRomER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Early Roman cults were funded by regular public offerings, large individual donations, and payment for services. The hierarchy could also profit from land ownership. Professionalism of the priesthood likely pre-dates the Roman era as similar patterns are evident in Greek and Egyptian civilization. When the state provided gifts, it was often in the form of a lavish construction, such as a new temple. Examples: priests of Isis were "full-time religious professionals" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_78_ItRomER]; Vestals were "supported by the state and were full-time professional clergy, along with the Priestess of Ceres and Proserpina." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_79_ItRomER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Priests "who interpreted the rules surrounding the auspices" were called augurs.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_80_ItRomER] The augurs worked within two defined areas: a "sacral boundary formed by the circuit of the old city wall (pomerium)" referred to as public auspices and "Outside the city (militae, 'in the field'), another set obtained the 'military' auspices."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_81_ItRomER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bureaucracy_characteristics">Bureaucracy characteristics</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Full-time bureaucrats ♣ absent ♥</b> Before the Roman Principate there was no formal bureaucracy.
