[MAJIDBENAM_REF_45_PeCuzL1] About 30km by 20km.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]South and west: taken early. North and east: more war, polities retained independence from the Incas longer (until about 1400 CE).

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_48_PeCuzL1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]For the Lucre Basin polity: Huaro also exhibits Lucre pottery after the Wari collapse [MAJIDBENAM_REF_49_PeCuzL1], may be in Choquepukio sphere of control?"The primary distribution of this style essentially encompasses the eastern end of the valley of Cuzco where Choquepukio and Pikillacta are located, extending to the southeast to include the modern towns of Andahuayllas, Huaro, and Urcos." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_50_PeCuzL1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Using Google maps area calculator, and mapping the location of Tipón (known fortress against the Killke), Urcos (furthest point where Lucre ceramic appears), and Choquepukio itself, a conservative estimate would be 70 squared kilometers. However there is no reference to the polity territory in the literature and a settlement survey is lacking to ascertain the extent of the Lucre polity.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b>Cuzco: 15,000?[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Cuzco valley: 5,000-10,000. According to a Spaniard in mid 16th century, valley held over 20,000. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_51_PeCuzL1] However, in the 1000-1250 CE period irrigation and terracing works had not all been completed, so maybe a bit less.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Cuzco valley population "grew markedly after about AD 1000" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_52_PeCuzL1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"There were many other settlements in the Lucre area; some of them, such as Minaspata and Coto-coto, were almost as large as Choquepukio (Dwyer 1971: 41; Glowacki 2002: 271). Since those towns likely housed several thousand people each, the populace collectively posed an ongoing challenge to Inca hegemony. Sarmiento’s (2007: 87, 96, 99) informants said that four successive Inca rulers - from Inka Roca to Pachakuti - all took up arms against them, but only the last was able to finally subjugate and then disperse them. Because of the extended animosities, it is no surprise that the Oropesa area that lay between them was an unoccupied buffer zone for much of the early era (Bauer and Covey 2004: 84-7)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_53_PeCuzL1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The possibly allied site of Cotocotuyoc was 45 ha. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_54_PeCuzL1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]If the three main towns had several thousand inhabitants each, we can infer that the Lucre confederation had at least 10,000 inhabitants.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ unknown ♥</b> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_55_PeCuzL1] Cuzco.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_69_PeCuzL1] Canals are documented amongst other hydraulic works (fountains) in the architecture at Choquepukio. "Por último, varios de ellos presentan obras hidráulicas elaboradas que consisten en canales y fuentes, en algunos casos con agua que es canalizada sobre afloramientos rocosos que, probablemente, eran piedras-huaca."

According to Alan Covey, this was not the case, and he questions the emphasis put on Wari roads by archaeologists:  "Not in Cuzco, and despite the assertions that the Incas used Wari infrastructure to conquer the highlands—which is really an argument for how the Incas could build an empire so quickly, one that is no longer needed with the preponderance of archaeological evidence—the regional archaeology along the route of the Inca road to Chinchaysuyu (which passed through Ayacucho) shows no Wari settlement along it (Belisle and Covey 2010; Belisle 2014).  The chronicles state that the route was established in Inca times, when the ninth ruler built the bridge across the Apurimac, but that is also an assertion that requires due scepticism."

Some scholars think that the earliest systematic use of the khipu as a recording tool occurred in Wari or other expansionist states. It may owe its genesis to institutional demands, such as keeping track of supplies (Quilter and Urton 2002; Brokaw 2010). If they are right, then the Incas elaborated a package of administrative techniques developed by their imperial predecessors. It is certainly the case that the tool was well established across the Andes before the Inca empire came along, as different societies reportedly used a variety of knot-tying conventions. The chronicler Murua wrote that, “each province, as it had its own language, also had a different form and logic [razón] of quipo” (translation from Platt 2002: 229). In short, the Incas’ challenge most likely lay in systematizing recording for state institutions and in bringing many thousands of knot-masters up to speed in the preferred format, not in developing a specific inscription technique for state interests from scratch." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_77_PeCuzL1] According to Alan Covey: "We should not assume that Wari used khipus, as none have been found.  The “Wari” khipus that Urton reports from the AMNH are from poorly known coastal provenances, and Wari never really ruled over the coast.  The Middle Horizon dates suggest that someone on the coast was using a khipu-like device, but it is a stretch to say that this was an imperial accounting device invented or used by Wari, and there is no evidence for Wari khipus in excavations of well-preserved Wari sites that have yielded abundant textile remains.
