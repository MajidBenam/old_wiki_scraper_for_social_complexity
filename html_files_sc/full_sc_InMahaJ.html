Erdosy "recorded the presence of four distinct tiers of settlement in the Era of Integration between 600 and 350 BCE (Erdosy 1988 : 55). These included (1) Kausambi, which increased in size to 50 hectares, (2) two sites between 10 and 49.9 hectares, (3) two between 6 and 9.99 hectares and (4) seventeen less than 5.99 hectares. The smallest category of sites was represented by simple ceramic scatters and has been interpreted as agricultural sites, as they had no evidence of craft activities. Craft activities were represented in the next category, sites between 6 and 9.99 hectares, as slag was recovered from a number of those settlements surveyed. Erdosy has termed the next category, between 10 and 49.9 hectares, towns, and the site of Kara has provided evidence of metal, semi-precious stone and shell working and coins."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_InMahaJ]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Administrative levels ♣ 4 ♥</b> levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Although the family books [early Vedic texts] reflect differences in rank and some inequalities in wealth, these do not add up to distinct socio-economic classes in the sense of significant differences in access and control over basic productive resources.
