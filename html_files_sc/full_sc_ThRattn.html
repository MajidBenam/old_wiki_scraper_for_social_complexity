A map provided by Wyatt [MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_ThRattn] suggests that the territory governed by Rattanakosin, tributary states included, corresponded roughly to modern-day Thailand, Laos and Cambodia. According to Google, the current size of each of these is, respectively, 513,120 km2, 236,800 km2, and 181,035 km2, for a total of 930,955 km2. However, the below population estimate probably only applies to the core region, which would have corresponded with Thailand.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ [1,000,000-3,000,000]: 1800 CE; [4,000,000-5,000,000]: 1850 CE ♥</b> People. "Evidence for the size and distribution of the population before the first census in 1911 is sparse and far from reliable. Estimates for the 1800-20 period vary from 1 to 3 million (Skinner, 1957:79; Sternstein, 1993:18). A detailed examination of the evidence by Sternstein (1965:1984) suggests very gradual growth from the 1780s to reach a population a little short of 5 million by the middle of the nineteenth century." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_ThRattn] It is not clear whether this estimate covers tributary states.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ [50,000-100,000] ♥</b> Inhabitants. "We know that in 1782, there was already some settlement on both banks of the river. Rama I chose for his new capital, and by the end of the first reign it would be unreasonable to suppose the capital had more than 50,000 or so. Terwiel's work suggests that at the Bowring Treaty (1855) Bangkok's population may have reached around 50,000-100,000. These are, of course, only very rough estimates, and it is well known that the river dwelling population makes it impossible to seek much more."

Royal Capital; 2. Four towns under the administration of the king (muang luk-luang); 3. Other towns under administration of governors (muang phraya-maha-nakhon); 4. Outlying towns or colonies (muang prathetsarat) which sent tributes to the king. In the late eighteenth century the second tier of inner-ring towns was absorbed into the capital.

The Siamese army command in the 1680s, for example, was described by Gervaise as consisting of a 'commander-in-chief, a deputy general, several captains with their lieutenants and some subalterns.' In actuality, members of the nobility through ad hoc appointments led Southeast Asian armies. These men were usually personal favorites of the ruler or one of his relatives, or were outlying lords obligated to bring local levies to participate in campaigns. One reason for this was the concern that otherwise a regular officer class on a permanent footing would become part of the court and ministerial politics that plagued early modern Southeast Asian states." Because the Thai army was reformed only in the early twentieth century [MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_ThRattn], it is reasonable to infer that there were no professional military officers throughout the late eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional soldiers ♣ absent ♥</b> The Thai standing army dates to 1905 [MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_ThRattn], although perhaps the king's personal guard should count as being made up of professional soldiers?</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional priesthood ♣ present ♥</b> Referring to Rama I: "[o]ne of his first actions was to reestablish the Buddhist monkhood."

It seems reasonable to infer that, before the reforms, Rattanakosin bureaucracy resembled Ayutthayan bureaucracy. Specifically, "[s]enior officials might also be awarded people and maybe land or its product.

"Each water-based feature fulfilled several functions. Barays provided agricultural and domestic water, and fish and plant foods. Canals channeled water for public sanitation, and transport arteries. Embankments and dikes were usually oriented east-west following the contours and acted both as levees ti control floods and elevated causeways for roads. Moats surrounding temples, monuments, and inhabited areas also fulfilled several functions: they served as sacred boundaries, they were a source of domestic water and food, and they provided fill for foundations to raise the level of the terrain for drainage and protection. Access to domestic water was provided by tanks and basins dug into the water table.’[MAJIDBENAM_REF_52_ThRattn]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ markets ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Inferred from Thailand's importance within international trade networks: "Bangkok was a royal city, main religious centre, and port of international trade."
