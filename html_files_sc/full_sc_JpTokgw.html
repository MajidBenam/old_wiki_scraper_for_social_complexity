However, in the early modern period, the nengo did not simply represent the duration of a governmental regime. New era names might be declared when auspicious events occurred or at certain points in the traditional 60- year (sexagenary) calendar cycle... Despite the official use of the lunar calendar, the solar calendar was also employed and was very important for farmers.’[MAJIDBENAM_REF_105_JpTokgw] ‘As the field of Western astronomy developed in Japan, the government appointed official astronomers (temmonkata) to serve and advise the shogunate. The first, Shibukawa Shunkai (or Harumi; 1639-1715), was a student of the theories of Copernicus. He utilized this knowledge to design a new calendar, the Jokyo calendar, based on a late 13thcentury Chinese calendar that was adopted as the official Japanese calendar in 1684.’[MAJIDBENAM_REF_106_JpTokgw]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Sacred Texts ♣ present ♥</b> The high literacy rate in the Tokugawa period (calculated at around 40% of the population) aided the proliferation of written works.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_107_JpTokgw]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious literature ♣ present ♥</b> ‘in the first decades of the early modern period, such as Buddhist sermons and Neo-Confucian ethical instruction.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_108_JpTokgw]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Practical literature ♣ present ♥</b>  travel guides; teaching books [MAJIDBENAM_REF_109_JpTokgw]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ History ♣ present ♥</b> There is a long tradition of historical recording in Japan.

The Edo period was a time of great intellectual change and development. New ways of thinking were derived from Neo-Confucian, Shinto, and Western sources. Within these three modes of thinking there was a great deal of variation between traditions and many instances of borrowing between traditions. It is Neo-Confucian thought, however, that framed much of the political, social, and moral discourse during the Edo period.’[MAJIDBENAM_REF_111_JpTokgw]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Scientific literature ♣ present ♥</b> ‘In medieval and early modern Japan, the natural sciences—including such disciplines as medicine, mathematics, and astronomy—were largely influenced by Chinese systems of science and classification of the natural world.’[MAJIDBENAM_REF_112_JpTokgw] ‘The seclusion policy only permitted contact with Dutch and Chinese traders, so it was largely through Dutch that the Japanese gained knowledge of Western science and medicine.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_113_JpTokgw] ‘the Ishimpo (Methods at the heart of medicine), composed in 982 by Tamba Yasuyori (912-995), is Japan’s oldest extant medical text and displays the influence of Chinese medicine and medical treatises on Japan’s understanding of medicine.’[MAJIDBENAM_REF_114_JpTokgw]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Fiction ♣ present ♥</b> One of the world’s oldest extant novels was written in Japan c.1000 in the Heian period.

Warriors, Buddhists, merchants, masterless samurai, and geisha were among those who became the subjects of this literature and those whose interests this literature sometimes expressed.’[MAJIDBENAM_REF_115_JpTokgw] ‘In similar fashion, the transition from the medieval to the early modern was accompanied by the gradual emergence of urban centers that were home to newly important social classes, such as merchants and other commoners. The social context of urban culture—in particular, the cities of Edo, Osaka, and Kyoto—was central to the development of early modern literary sensibilities and tastes. Warrior literature was not replaced, but early modern literature is notable for its articulation of the interests and concerns of merchants, artisans, and other nonelite members of early modern society.... Because of the contact with the Dutch, the Dutch language became the medium through which new Western scientific and medical knowledge were disseminated. Translations of Dutch scientific and medical books into Japanese led to the advancement of Japanese scientific thinking and opened up whole new ways to think about the natural world, including anatomy, astronomy, and geography.’[MAJIDBENAM_REF_116_JpTokgw][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/><b>Money</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Articles ♣ present ♥</b>rice[MAJIDBENAM_REF_117_JpTokgw]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Tokens ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> Not mentioned by sources.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Precious metals ♣ present♥</b> ‘Ieyasu also used precious metals in trade, gift giving, and decoration.
