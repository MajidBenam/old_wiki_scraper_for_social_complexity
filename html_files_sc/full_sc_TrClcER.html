Its diameter is approximately 300 m. The northwestern part of the mound is cut by a road; and the northeastern part by an old river bed replaced by a channel. Another reason why its dimensions cannot be exactly understood is that the mound is partly surrounded by alluvium like in Eastern Çatalhöyük. According to the researches; Western Çatalhöyük covers an area of 6.9 hectares. This is 8.5 hectares when the find distribution at the level of the alluvium is considered."

Rituals in the Early Chalcolicthic include burials of all types. Most burials are located under the floors of houses, bodies stacked on the right side in hocker position. In many cases, the skull is missing. At Köşk Höyük, all burials have burial gifts such as vessels, beads, and obsidian tools. Anthropomorphic figurines have also been found, which are most probably connected to some unspecified rituals. Widespread standardisation and routinisation of ritual practices (e.g. burial, house burning, wall plastering) at Çatalhöyük suggests at least some religious hierarchy [MAJIDBENAM_REF_70_TrClcER].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Military levels ♣ [1-2] ♥</b> For the period of the Early Chalcolithic, we do not know of any specific conflicts between different social groups or cultures. We have no evidence of archaeological or historical warfare. However, the lack of such evidence does not mean we can exclude the potential of warfare taking place. The listed handheld weapons have been placed in the category of warfare because we have no archaeological evidence for the purposes for which they were used - whether they were used only for hunting or for hypothetical battles.

The same objects were found also in Çatalhöyük East [MAJIDBENAM_REF_74_TrClcER]. In total,  nearly 400 of these objects have been recorded at Çatalhöyük[MAJIDBENAM_REF_75_TrClcER]. These are the so-called 'potstands'. Placed in pairs over the fire, they would support a cooking pot[MAJIDBENAM_REF_76_TrClcER]. As they appear in the Late Neolithic, they may be an important indicator of a shift away from the use of interior fixed architectural fire installations for cooking, towards the use of ceramic vessels balanced on potstands [MAJIDBENAM_REF_77_TrClcER].Potstands have also been found at Can Hasan (mainly in levels II and I).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_78_TrClcER]. "At Can Hasan is some evidence that walls were coated with white plaster, and fragment of red-on-white painted plaster suggest some rooms were ornamented with geometric patterns." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_79_TrClcER] "Simple; geometrical decorated painted plaster pieces; recovered in the space deposit; on the floor; are observed to have come from the upper levels due to their lying position. A thin level of gray or light blue whitewash on white plaster was revealed in one of the rooms of a building (No:3). Red paint on white plaster was used on the walls and on the floor of another building (No:9)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_80_TrClcER] Here, decorated pottery should be mentioned. Some of the sherds reveal pointille, impressed, scratched, incised and channeled decoration. Triangles, zigzags, and wavy-lines are the frequent patterns in decoration[MAJIDBENAM_REF_81_TrClcER]. Pottery in the Early Chalcolithic is mostly painted. The majority of the decorations are red or brown painted straight‐line geometric motifs, applied over a cream or yellowish‐buff slip, which is subsequently burnished. It is characteristic of the Konya Plain sites, such as Çatalhöyük West and Canhasan. For sites of Cappadocia, pottery is characterized by relief decorations (e.g. sites: Köşk Höyük and Tepecik / Çiftlik)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_82_TrClcER]. "The fine wares decorated with high reliefs of Köşk Höyük Levels I and II are extraordinary. These depict the mother goddess; other deities; human figures; vegetation; and various animals such as bull; goat; donkey; antelope; deer; serpent; ram; tortoise; and birds. Some of these depictions are stylized like the goddess figures with her hair waving with the wind and the one with her hands on her waist or realistic like a chamois. Some are decorated with white incrustation and some (especially serpents' eyes) with inlayed obsidian pieces."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_83_TrClcER] PF: interpretation of the figurines as representations of the Goddess is nowadays considered universalistic and non-context dependent and, as such, rejected.</div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Kinds_of_Written_Documents">Kinds of Written Documents</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Lists, tables, and classifications ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Calendar ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Sacred Texts ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious literature ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Practical literature ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ History ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Philosophy ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Scientific literature ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Fiction ♣ inferred absent ♥</b><br/></div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Money">Money</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Articles ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Tokens ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Precious metals ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Foreign coins ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Indigenous coins ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Paper currency ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Postal_System">Postal System</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Couriers ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Postal stations ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ General postal service ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div></body></html>
