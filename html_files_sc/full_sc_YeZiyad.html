Based on the following quotes, it seems that this polity was roughly equivalent to the coastal region of modern Yemen. "The Ziyadi state was firmly entrenched in the Tinhama, and enjoyed loose suzerainty over a sultan at Aden, whose authority extended eastward along the coast. The Banu Ziyad, on the other hand, had no influence in the highlands."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_YeZiyad] "Ephemerally, the Banu Ziyad reunited nearly in its entirety the South Arabian state of the Himyarites. They were unable to hold the hinterland, however, against the many separatist movements which arose."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_YeZiyad] The Zaydi Imamate formed one of the borders of this polity: "In 893, Al-Hadi ila al-Haqq (al-Hadi), invited to the North Yemeni town of Saada to mediate local disputes, proceeds to found there the Zaydi imamate that, based on Zaydi Shii teachings, was to hold sway over at least part of North Yemen nearly continuously until the 1962 Revolution."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_YeZiyad]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ ♥</b> People.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ ♥</b> Inhabitants.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Sanaa[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1050 CE 'a thousand houses'.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]'the time of al-Rashid': 'one hundred thousand' houses.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]A Zaidi chronicler reported that "From [1014-1056] ruin prevailed in Sanaa and elsewhere in the country of Yemen ... the inhabitants became so extenuated that they dispersed in all directions.

The tribes in the north, between Nejran and Sa'da, refused any outside control or interference in their mutual quarrels until they themselves called in the first Zaidi imam as umpire. In the southern and west-central mountains, the continuing development of Shi'a sentiment provided opportunity for founding the first Fatimid regimes in Yemen. At the beginning of the tenth century, thus, Yemen was divided among four essentially independent entities."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_YeZiyad]</div></div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/><b>♠ Religious levels ♣ ♥</b> levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"In 1007 a Yu'firid prince of the Ismaili persuasion, 'Abdullah ibn Qahtan, suceeded to the rule of Sanaa, and even made a successful foray against that stronghold of Sunnism, the Ziyad state in the Tihama, now in its decline."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_YeZiyad][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"By the late ninth century the Fatimids were conducting a ramified international underground movement centered in Iraq. It was out of the question to move directly against the base of Abbasid power, and planning focused upon the provinces - successively Syria, Yemen, and the Maghreb - where conditions appeared propitious for a secessionist state. ... In 880 two remarkable individuals were chosen to lead the movement in Yemen, both being first converted from the 'twelver' sect of Shi'ism."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_YeZiyad][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"For a century and a half no central power of consequence existed in the Yemen inland from the Tihama.
