The largest were Naimans, Kereids, Tatars, Merkids, and Mongols whose territories ranged from ?? - ?? km sq. The code reflects the territory size of an 'average' large polity in this region (referring to those named above).[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Inner Mongolia is shaped South West to North East. The territory's description would make more sense if it included the North Eastern part of Inner Mongolia and East of Lake Baikal. Such an estimate would produce a territory of 1,000,000 km2 which is an average of 50,000 km2 each.</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]AD: Nikolay Kradin confirmed that the map produced by Edward was correct, so this means that his assessment of the territory including the North Eastern part of Inner Mongolia was right.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Under another variable Kradin says: "The rough scale of these chiefdoms was ?? km. A mounted messenger could cover this distance in 5-7 days." Orbis database says Roman horse could cover 56 km day[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_MnMongE] 50*6 is 300 km. Square-shaped polity would be 90,000 km2.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/>Because this NGA during this period was a quasi-polity, the codes refer to a typical large polity, such as Naimans, Kereids, Tatars, Merkids, and Mongols.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ [80,000-120,000] ♥</b> Typical number of inhabitants of a polity.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The overall population of Mongolia during this period was 600,000-1,000,000 (Kradin 2002). Chinggiz Khan had 8 (check) thousand warriors in the decisive battle against Jamucha, who had roughly the same size of his force. 16,000 x 5 (est. average Mongol 'tent') = 80,000. Rounding this gives us an estimate of the population size of the larger polities in Mongolia (Rachewiltz 2004).[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Because this NGA during this period was a quasi-polity, the codes refer to a typical large polity, such as Naimans, Kereids, Tatars, Merkids, and Mongols.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Around 1260 the total nomadic population of Central and Inner Asia, all of which was included in the Mongol empire at that time, would have been about 4,250,000. Two fifths of this, or 1.7 million people, would have been found in Outer or Inner Mongolia; one fifth, or 850,000 people, in the Chaghatay realm of Transoxania, Semirechye and parts of Jungaria and the Tarim Basin; one-fifth in the Juchids' domains in northern Central Asia and the North Caucasian and South Russian steppe; and the remaining fifth in the Middle East with Hulegu."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_MnMongE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ 500 ♥</b> The mobile camp of the chief and his retinue could have more than 100 tents, which gives us a rough estimate of 500 (Kradin and Skrynnikova 2006).[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Because this NGA during this period was a quasi-polity, the codes refer to a typical large polity, such as Naimans, Kereids, Tatars, Merkids, and Mongols.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hierarchical_Complexity">Hierarchical Complexity</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ 1 ♥</b> levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]There were no permanent settlements.
