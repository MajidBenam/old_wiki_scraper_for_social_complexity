To the south lay the Theban kingdom ruled by the 16th Dynasty. To the north the Hyksos 15th Dynasty and a possible array of vassal rulers would have dominated the Nile Delta. At the beginning of this era the vestiges of the 13th Dynasty may have still controlled the area around the Middle Kingdom royal capital at Itj-Tawy, even after secession of Upper Egypt (Ilin-Tomich 2014)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_EgThebH][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Hyksos held Upper Egypt only for a short time. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_EgThebH] Manetho implied Hyksos initially held the entire country. Delta was the stronghold. Carnarvon Tablet I suggests territory as far as "Middle Egypt" toward end of 17th Dynasty. There are Hyksos monuments south of Middle Egypt but not much evidence for occupation this region. Cusae possibly southern limit, as suggested by Newberry. Southern granite was used in the Hyksos realm, but this could have come from trade. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_EgThebH] Khian's name not found south of Gebelein (40 km south of Thebes). Khian's rule before 1620 BCE.
