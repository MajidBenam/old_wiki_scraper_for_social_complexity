"Only toward the end of the fifth millennium did settlement shift toward the west, where Susa became the pre-eminent site. The early settlement is estimated to have covered some 15 ha, about the same as Choga Mish."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_IrKhzM*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"To the north of Susa, along the same terrace, there were some small settlements such as Jaffarabad, Jowi, Bendebal, and Bouhallan that were occupied at various times from the late sixth through late fifth millennia (dollfus 1978)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_IrKhzM*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]On Khuzistan Plain there were "hundreds of sites dating from the sixth through fifth millennia (Adams 1962; Kouchoukos and Hole 2003)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_IrKhzM*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]At Tall-i Bakun in fifth-millennium Fars there was a settlement with houses that had three-five rooms each.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_IrKhzM*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Susa not present at this time: "... from the late sixth millennium B.C. onward its northern part had been settled by farming and livestock-raising peoples. More than one thousand years after the appearance of those first permanent villages Susa was founded, in the north-west corner of the [Khuzistan] plain on the banks of a small stream called the Shaur. The site was occupied more or less continually from about 4000 B.C. until the 13th century A.D., when it was abandoned after the Mongol conquest."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_IrKhzM*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Like most of Mesopotamia, during its most stylistically unified period in the Ubaid 1-3 periods (5300-4600 BC), Susiana was occupied by small villages (2 hectares or less). Presumably, these villagers subsisted through irrigation agriculture and animal husbandry (Dollfus 1985; Hole 1985). Not until the middle of this period did one site, Choga Mish, increase rapidly in size to 11 hectares. The site for which the area is named, Susa, had not been founded yet." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_IrKhzM*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Chogha Mish became the largest site on the Susiana plan during the Middle Chalcolithic (Middle Susiana or Susiana b-d), during which time it extended over the whole site, an area of about 15 ha (Delougaz and Kantor 1996: 284)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_IrKhzM*] According to the [50-200] inhabitants range per hectare applied consistently throughout Seshat, this would give us an estimate of [750-3000] inhabitants for Chogha Mish.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hierarchical_Complexity">Hierarchical Complexity</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ 2 ♥</b> levels.

The starting point of this process has to be the progress in agriculture, which in the Mesopotamian alluvial plain had become possible through extensive irrigation and the introduction of the cattle-drawn plough. These changes led to the beginnings of labour specialisation, the subsequent emergence of agents responsible for the coordination of social organisation and decision-making processes (mainly centred on the leading role of temples), and the progressive social stratification of communities."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_IrKhzM*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Given the formal differences and large geographic distance between the Hamrin and Bakun regions, it is hardly surprising to find differences in daily practices.

It was burned down in the early 5th millennium BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_IrKhzM*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]'The size and nature of its architecture and material remains indicate that Chogha Mish [during the Middle Susiana period] was an important regional administrative center. However, the precise nature of the administrative activities carried out there remains unclear ... The excavators have suggested that the monumental architectural precinct may have had both an industrial and religious focus ... Although likely, this has not yet been fully demonstrated in the literature. It is interesting to note, however, that the majority of the published objects which appear to have functioned as tokens all cluster around a single Middle Susiana structure ... A small number of sealings were also recovered from this context'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_IrKhzM*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]This quote suggests possibility of specialized administrative buildings at Choga Mish: "Although they are sparse, the published findings imply that Choga Mish was a center of regional importance.
