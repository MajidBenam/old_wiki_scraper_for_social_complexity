However, this is largely speculative based on the current archaeological record. The description of Bactria as 'the land of a thousand cities' does seem to imply a relatively dense population. So far, only two of these have seen extensive excavation.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_AfGrBct] There is also evidence that Bactria was fertile and extensively irrigated. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_AfGrBct][MAJIDBENAM_BR]McEvedy and Jones [MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_AfGrBct][MAJIDBENAM_BR]200 BCE: Russian Turkestan: 1,000,000; Afghanistan 1,750,000. Highest density of population likely to be in the Greco-Bactrian region which contained cities.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/>126 BCE the Chinese chronicler Zhang Qian estimated "some 1,000,000 or more persons."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_AfGrBct]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ [25,000-50,000] ♥</b>[25,000-50,000] - reasoning below <i>ET</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Ai Khanoum was a substantial and sophisticated city: there was a "sprawling" palace complex, theatre, temple, gymnasium, arsenal, storehouses, cemetery, a wall, fortifications and multiple areas for habitation.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_AfGrBct]  The people imported olive oil and visited "a Greek theatre like that of Delphi and larger than the one at Babylon."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_AfGrBct] The city held "an elite residential district with 50 or more mansions"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_AfGrBct] and among the segregated Greek/non-Greek population could be found "every occupation and trade one would find in a prosperous town in Greece itself."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_AfGrBct][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The theatre had a seating capacity of 6,000; although this might not "represent the size of the population living in the city."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_AfGrBct] The gymnasium was remarkable for being "the largest in the Greek world."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_AfGrBct][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The population at Ai Khanoum may be much larger than the theatre's 6,000 capacity. The region was surrounded by irrigated lands had a military base and diverse cultural life. The 6,000 may provide a lower limit for an estimate. The loose correlation between the seating-capacity of any settlement's largest theatre and its peak population size might assist an improved estimate. The largest Greek cities had theatres with seating-capacity of up to 17,000. If Ai Khanoum's theatre was one third of the size, then its population might be that much less than the population of the largest Greek city (100k?).[MAJIDBENAM_BR]For an upper limit for the population at Ai Khanoum we could look at Samarkand in 300 BCE which may have had 100,000. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_AfGrBct] (No estimate for 200 BCE, however Samarkand still in existence at this time).  Although Samarkand may not have had this population level in 200 BCE 100,000 might be considered to be near the upper limit of what could be expected for Ai Khanoum, which is in the same region, 100 years later. The seating-capacity of the theatre at Ai Khanoum, however, would suggest a population much lower than this.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/>Ai Khanum is one of the only cities to have been discovered. The shape of the  town was triangular, extending for two km in a north-south direction, one and a half km from east-west. It is located along the left bank of the Amu Darya at its confluence with the Kokcha River. The city was protected by large towers, a moat and an acropolis, as well as a large palace complex. Accurate estimates of its population are impossible because of the amount of looting on the site.

From what limited work that has been undertaken, The Greek polis was the administrative, ritualized, and monumental heartland of the territory, but not the dominant population centre and represented a new construction. Below this new urban space was the existing infrastructure of towns and villages of the indigenous Bactrians.

By 126 BCE, according to the the Chinese chronicler Zhang Qian: "Daxia (Bactria) is located ... south of the Gui (Oxus) river. Its people cultivate the land and have cities and houses.

Below this level, the hyparchy, roughly translated as prefecture. Below the level of Satrap the local elites who supported of the ruler were ranked as varying level of 'friends' based on favor or eunoia. Loyalty was enhanced further by the granting of vast land holding, villages, slaves and other wealth. Below this level was the topoi.

There is no good evidence on whether this was made into a formalized practice, or the structure of religious practice.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]There was a "Mesopotamian-style temple" in Ai Khanoum so at least one level can be inferred.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_42_AfGrBct][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"On the north side of the Oxus (present-day Amu Darya) River a few miles north of the Tajikistan/Afghanistan border and a day's ride west of Ai Khanoum, archaeologists have found a smaller, but no less interesting, 3rd - 2nd century BC Hellenistic-era site: a temple structure known locally as Takht-i-Sangin.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The site appeared to be a combination Greek temple and Zoroastian fire temple, reflecting the dual traditions that existed in Bactria during the Hellenistic era."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_43_AfGrBct]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Military levels ♣ 5 ♥</b>The ranks below are based on the organization of the Seleucid army.

It is therefore inferred that some element of this system was preserved after independence.
