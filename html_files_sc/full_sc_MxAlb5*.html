Flannery and Marcus have done a fine job of pulling together what can be gleaned from the 16th century sources (e.g., Flannery 1983 "The Legacy of the Early Urban Period: An Ethnohistoric Approach"  in The Cloud People). Taking a broad view of administration [...] one can identify several governing specialists in the 16th sources, for example: coquitao (king), coquihualao (prince), xoana (minor noble), golaba (lord's solicitor or barrio head), uija-tao (high priest), bigaña (lower-ranking priests).
