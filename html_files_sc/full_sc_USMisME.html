Most people lived in these nucleated villages, each of which was occupied by at least a few tens of people, and sometimes several times that number. Only a small proportion of the valley's inhabitants lived in houses that were widely separated from one another."  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_USMisME][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"It has been argued that villages with well over a hundred buildings had developed by the late Emergent Mississippian period." However "it is equally possible that the feature patterns represent nothing more than multiple super-imposed, short-term occupations that cannot be teased apart." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_USMisME][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/>Houses organized around a courtyard[MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the Emergent Mississippian "The community pattern usually included organized groupings of houses and other structures arranged around a courtyard, often with a central post that was sometimes surrounded by four pits, and larger structures probably communal or ceremonial, to one side or in the courtyard area."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_USMisME][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Site plans gained greater internal complexity as houses clustered into court-yard groups and, toward [1000 CE], the southern pattern of civic-ceremonial centers with large earthen mounds was established in many places.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/>Shift from nucleated to dispersed configuration[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Soon after A.D. 1000 people's lives changed abruptly. Two of the most obviously signs of a profound alteration in the fabric of this society are a great increase in moundbuilding and a shift in small communities from nucleated to dispersed configurations." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_USMisME][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The beginning of the Mississippian period was marked by an abrupt shift in the character of peripheral communities ... The predominantly nucleated pattern of settlement was abandoned in favor of widely scattered single-family farmsteads."
