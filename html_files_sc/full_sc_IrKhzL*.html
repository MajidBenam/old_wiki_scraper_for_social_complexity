The site was occupied more or less continually from about 4000 B.C. until the 13th century A.D., when it was abandoned after the Mongol conquest."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_IrKhzL*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]At Tall-i Bakun in fifth-millennium Fars there was a settlement with houses that had three-five rooms each.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_IrKhzL*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hierarchical_Complexity">Hierarchical Complexity</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ 2 ♥</b> levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"During the Choga Mish phase, the number of sites on the Susiana Plain reached a maximum.

The starting point of this process has to be the progress in agriculture, which in the Mesopotamian alluvial plain had become possible through extensive irrigation and the introduction of the cattle-drawn plough. These changes led to the beginnings of labour specialisation, the subsequent emergence of agents responsible for the coordination of social organisation and decision-making processes (mainly centred on the leading role of temples), and the progressive social stratification of communities."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_IrKhzL*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Given the formal differences and large geographic distance between the Hamrin and Bakun regions, it is hardly surprising to find differences in daily practices. Perhaps more astonishing is the extent to which they share broadly similar traditions of preparing and serving food, along with similar technological features and generalized types of sociopolitical organization."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_IrKhzL*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious levels ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the later Uruk phase "Urban Revolution" c3800-3000 BCE that the following quote refers to religious ideology became more complex, so can infer still low level religious complexity in this period: "Early state formation therefore featured both the rise of a ruling class, making decisions and benefiting from a privilaged position, and the development of a political and religious ideology.
