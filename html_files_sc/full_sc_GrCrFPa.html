Firth estimated the Cretan population during Late Minoan IIIA and IIIB periods (1400-1200 BCE) as 110,000.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_GrCrFPa] There are not estimates for the Final Post Palatial Period; settlement patterns, however, points to a considerable population decrease especially during 1100-1000 BCE. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_GrCrFPa] Moreover, during this period Crete was divided up into many small, independent political units.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_GrCrFPa] Expert input may be needed to suggest a figure for the typical population of one of these polities.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣1,000♥</b> people. The largest settlement of the period was Knossos and its population is estimated to about 1,000 people. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_GrCrFPa] There is no detailed data for the size of many of the other Final Postpalatial settlements. If we consider, however, that the average size of a large settlement is about 2.5 to 4.5 ha., we could speculate a population of 375 to 600 souls or 75 to 80 families. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_GrCrFPa] Karphi, one of the few fully excavated settlements of the period (1200-1000 BCE), consisted of 125 to 150  houses. If we  assume a figure of five persons as a typical household, we have a total population of 625 to 750 souls.

During the next period, 1200-1000 BCE, settlement patterns changed and followed marked regional tranjectories. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_GrCrFPa]  In the area of west and central Crete many sites experienced growth and retrieval (e.g. Chania, Knossos, Phaistos, and Kastelli Pediada). The growth of these sites has encouraged some scholars to assert the arrival of newcomers. The process of nucleation around certain lowland settlements surrounded by arable lands and costal sites provided with harbors is in contrast to the limited regional occupation. This pattern highlight the significant changes in economic, social and ideological aspects of local societies. The foundation of new inland sites (Sybrita and Gortyna) and the diffusion of defensible sites, although less numerous that these in east Crete, suggest complex settlement patterns able to deal with diversified environmental resources. In the area of east Crete the consequence of the LM IIIB crisis were more disruptive.  Many plain and costal sites were abandoned and new settlements were founded on strategic locations at night altitudes. The population growth and the increased in size of the upland settlements lead to a stable occupation and even to the emergence of some major sites (e.g. Kavousi-Vronda and Karphi).</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Administrative levels ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious levels ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Military levels ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Professions">Professions</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional military officers ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional soldiers ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional priesthood ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bureaucracy_characteristics">Bureaucracy characteristics</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Full-time bureaucrats ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Examination system ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Merit promotion ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Specialized government buildings ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Law">Law</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Formal legal code ♣absent♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Judges ♣absent♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Courts ♣absent♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional Lawyers ♣absent♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Specialized_Buildings:_polity_owned">Specialized Buildings: polity owned</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ irrigation systems ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ drinking water supply systems ♣absent♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ markets ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ food storage sites ♣ ♥</b></div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Transport_infrastructure">Transport infrastructure</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Roads ♣present♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Bridges ♣present♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Canals ♣absent♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ports ♣present♥</b></div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Special_purpose_sites">Special purpose sites</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Mines or quarries ♣ present ♥</b> quarries</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Information">Information</span></h3><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Writing_System">Writing System</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Mnemonic devices ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Nonwritten records ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Written records ♣ absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Script ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Phonetic alphabetic writing ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Kinds_of_Written_Documents">Kinds of Written Documents</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Lists, tables, and classifications ♣absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Calendar ♣absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Sacred Texts ♣absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious literature ♣absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Practical literature ♣absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ History ♣absent  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Philosophy ♣absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Scientific literature ♣absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Fiction ♣absent ♥</b><br/></div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Money">Money</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Articles ♣present ♥</b> It has been generally argued that all economic transactions were based on fruitful barter.
