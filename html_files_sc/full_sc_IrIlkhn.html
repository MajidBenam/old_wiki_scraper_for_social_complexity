Estimate of Ilkhanate at its greatest extent.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Ilkhanate emerged from the Mongol conquest of Iran, Iraq and Turkey. The armies of Hulegu had attacked and destroyed many of the great cites of the Middle East, and ended the Abbasid Caliphate. Local dynasties had to submit to Mongol rule. In 1300 the Mongols spilt up their empire into four semi-independent regions, one of these was the Ilkhanate. From then on it was a fairly autonomous polity, although its rulers acknowledged a higher authority in the Great Khan. The Ilkhanate saw the return of stability to the region. Over time the Ilkhanate absorbed influences from Persia and the Middle East, becoming less 'Mongol'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_IrIlkhn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ 5,250,000: 1300 CE ♥</b> People.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]McEvedy and Jones[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_IrIlkhn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Iran: 3.5m[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Afghanistan: 1.75m[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The problem in Persia is that land that has been neglected may well not be easy to bring back into cultivation.

The city was expanded aggressively, the outer walls increasing from twelve thousand paces in circumference to thirty thousand. ... Oljeytu intended Sultaniya to become a fully functioning capital, no mere royal camp. He duly embarked on a terrific building spree, ordering his courtiers to design graceful palaces and gardens. The vizier Rashid al-din built an entire quarter of a thousand houses. Another, Tak al-din Ali Shah, built a lavish, ten-thousand-dinar palace called Paradise, its doors, walls and floors studded with pearls, gold, rubies, turquoise, emeralds and amber.
