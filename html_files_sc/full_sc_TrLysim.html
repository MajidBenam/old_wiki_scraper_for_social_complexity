It was ruled by a Macedonian ruler and aristocracy with the participation of some locals such as Bytis and Paris, citizens of Lysimacheia, supposed to be of Thracian or Thracian-Phrygian origin. The royal domains and the subjected poleis were governed by strategoi or epistat appointed by the King.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_TrLysim][MAJIDBENAM_BR]“In Asia Minor, the Hellespont and Thrace, from the 280s BC, at least, the <i>strategos’</i> authority extended to the Greek cities lying within the satrapy; his intervention might take various forms and is often beneficent in effect.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_TrLysim] Lysimachus’ <i>strategos</i> of the Ionians: “Until recently, only one incumbent of the post was known to us, the Milesian Hippostratus, philos of the king and recipient in 289-8 BC of conspicuous honours awarded by the cities of the Ionian koinon. Now, another strategos, Hippodamus, also from Miletus, has stepped out of the shadows, courtesy of a recently published inscription from Chios.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_TrLysim][MAJIDBENAM_BR]It is likely that there were administrative levels beneath the <i>strategos</i>, but evidence from this time is sparse.[MAJIDBENAM_BR](2) King[MAJIDBENAM_BR](1) <i>Strategos</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Under Macedonian Empire may have had -[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1.
