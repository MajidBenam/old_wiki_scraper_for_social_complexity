Previously coded as [71-340] people, based on the following reasoning: As sources do not suggest there is evidence for a widespread unified polity during this period, the population estimate of the largest settlement (San José Mogote) has been coded here.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_MxTieLa] The population of the whole Valley of Oaxaca has been estimated at 463-935 people, who were mainly concentrated in the Etla arm (~52% of the population)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_MxTieLa][MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_MxTieLa] "Table 11.3.

The actual extent of San José Mogote during this period cannot be determined because of later disturbance and the movement of materials from this period: “The Settlement Pattern Project estimates San José Mogote to have had between 71 and 186 persons... Our [Flannery and Marcus, 2005] estimates for the site of San José Mogote, based on excavation, would be 170-340 persons... There is no way to know, at present, whether either of those estimates is accurate.”[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_MxTieLa] "Table 11.3.

Around 26 settlements were occupied during the Tierras Largas phase[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_MxTieLa]. Most of these settlements were small villages or hamlets, except for San José Mogote which was larger and had public buildings and a defensive palisade, although sources do not suggest there is evidence that the influence of San Jose Mogote extended beyond the village to other villages.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1. Including both the largest village, San Jose Mogote, and smaller villages throughout the valley.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Large village: San José Mogote (estimated at 7.8ha in size), although it consisted of 9 loosely clustered residential areas.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_MxTieLa][MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_MxTieLa]. The site included: nuclear family houses; subterranean storage pits (collectively 1,000kg maize per household); ritual “men’s houses”; and a palisade defense along western periphery consisting of a double line of posts, dated to 1300 BCE (which could have extended further but archaeological remains have been destroyed in other areas)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_MxTieLa] Small villages or hamlets (most were between 0.1-1.5 ha in size).[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Smaller villages: The "type site" for this phase, Tierras Largas, covered around 1.58-2.24ha and consisted of 5-10 households with nearby storage pits.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_MxTieLa][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/><b>♠ Administrative levels ♣ 1 ♥</b> levels. One administrative level is inferred, as sources do not suggest there is evidence that one village exerted influence on another, and storage pits were located nearby individual households.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_MxTieLa] San José Mogote has evidence for subterranean storage facilities which could hold up to 1,000kg of maize per household, and ritual “Men’s Houses”[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_MxTieLa]. The exact relationship between San José Mogote and the surrounding smaller villages in the Etla region is unknown.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1. Organisation was based at the village or household level in both the large and small villages.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Large village: San José Mogote (estimated at 7.8ha in size)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_MxTieLa][MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_MxTieLa].
