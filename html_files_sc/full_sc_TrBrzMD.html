Published cuneiform tablets often mention names of gods, but as the role of temples in the economic system is unclear, and hardly ever spoken about, there is not much trace of religious hierarchy. Priests are called <i>kumurum</i> and knowledge about their existence comes from tablet on which they are mentioned as witnesses to the economic transactions.
