Rackham and Moody argued that the population of palatial Crete (Middle Minoan II-Late Minoan I or 1800-1450 BCE) was about 216,000-271,000.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_GrCrNPa] For population estimates see also Branigan.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_GrCrNPa] Expert input may be needed to produce a figure for the population of a typical regional polity in this period.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣[25,000-30,000] ♥</b> inhabitants. Knossos is the largest site of Neopalatial Crete. The estimated site size is about 60-80 hectares making Knossos the largest urban centre of Prehistoric Greece. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_GrCrNPa] Whitelaw estimated Knossian population to 25,000-30,000 people replacing his previous estimate of 14,000-18,000 individuals [MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_GrCrNPa]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hierarchical_Complexity">Hierarchical Complexity</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ [1-6] ♥</b> levels. Excavated testimonies supplemented with information from systematic survey projects provide a sound starting point for the reconstruction of settlement hierarchies during the New Palace period. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_GrCrNPa] According to the most widely accepted narrative Crete was divided into regional polities controlled by political fractions residing in monumental complexes, generally known as "palaces", built at the center of large urban centers. These large towns -their extend is 25 ha or more-  were the "capitals" of the regional quasi-polities dominating the political landscape of Crete. Small towns, their size varies from 10 to 4 ha, were scattered in the hinterland. They were provided with substantial central buildings which in their architectural layout emulate these of the capital towns. Villages, hamlets and farmhouses were in the periphery of these towns and even in remote and marginal areas.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Administrative levels ♣ 5 ♥</b> levels. [1-5] 1: village heads; 2: town heads; 3: district heads; 4: regional governors; 5: central government.  As for many other facets of Neopalatial societies, evidence for administration is limited and consists mostly of clay archival documents.  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_GrCrNPa]  We may assume that villages and town were controlled by local leaders whose in their turn were under the administration of high ranking government officials. It seems likely that the control was local and related to small territorial units. Texts deal mostly with agricultural staples (cereal crops, olive oil and olives, wine, figs and some other unidentified goods) and occasionally with dependent work-force, livestock, craft products,  wool, and pottery. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_GrCrNPa] The cornerstone of political economies was the exploitation of agricultural wealth. Staples were kept in central stores and were used for the needs of a limited number of individuals [MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_GrCrNPa] They sustained elite and dependent craftsmen and laborers, financed state enterprises, and were consumed in large-scale ceremonial events in order to project political and social power and reaffirm social status. Archival data shows that goods were collected thought taxation. Whether they were produced in land owned by the central administration  or land that was privately owned cannot be determined. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_GrCrNPa] The preserved documents only record the transactions in which the central administration was directly interested, and thus do not provide a complex picture of all economy and administrative aspects of a given sociopolitical setting. The juxtaposition of archaeological material excavated in sites where archival documents were found with goods recorded in the tables shows that  Linear A tablets cover only part of the administrative concerns [MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_GrCrNPa] Important craft goods and raw material (ingots, tusk of ivory, steatite ext.) used for the production of precious artifacts whose possession and display were critical to the state's ability to clay legitimacy and stored in the  stores of the central administration [MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_GrCrNPa] were not mentioned in tablets. According to Schoep "the absence of any reference to such goods in the tablets is surprising and cannot be explained in terms of lack of interest on the part of administration in the production and/or aqcuisition of craft goods, since this is contradicted by the archaeological evidence. The possibility that documents other than tablets were concerned with craft goods must be seriously considered." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_GrCrNPa] The variety of sealed documents (single-holes nodules, two-hole hanging nodules, roundels, noduli and flat-based nodules) used for sealing perishables documents highlight the importance of documents written in perishable materials in the Neopalatial administration. Officials surveyed the countryside and brought back information to the central administration. Clay tablets "were dealing with one kind of obligations, which mainly concerned agricultural commodities, while sealed documents related to other kind of transactions, involving a different, perhaps wider geographical scale and commodities and/or matters of a different administrative status. At the end of the administration cycle the information from the tablets was copied onto documents in perishable materials, to which single-hole hanging nodules may have been attached." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_42_GrCrNPa]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious levels ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> levels. Male and female figures depicted in various iconographic media were often identified as priests and priestesses.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_43_GrCrNPa] The frequency of such depictions during the New Palace period has been interpreted as " a need for a more pronounced identity arose as a result of the greater consolidation of the ruling class." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_44_GrCrNPa] The sacerdotal figures were dressed with sumptuary adorned robes and dresses, have special hairstyles and hold insignia of their authority (curved axes, double-axes, stone maces, and ritual objects). They were also often accompanied by certain symbolic images: animal heads (scarified victims), winged creatures, and animals attacker/predators. All evidence points to a division between priest and priestess: priest were associated with hunting and perhaps in the daily administration  while priestess  to pouring of libations, processions, bringing offerings and performing dances. The most important ritual performed by priestesses was  the impersonation of the goddess. According Marinatos "Minoan priesthood was a permeant profession and not a stage in the "career" of the nobility". and "I would think that the priesthood in palatial Crete formed a strong corporation from the ranks of which the priest-king and the goddess impersonator were chosen." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_45_GrCrNPa] It should be noted, however, that because of the absence of sound information all these are speculations.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Military levels ♣ ♥</b> levels.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Professions">Professions</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional military officers ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional soldiers ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional priesthood ♣present♥</b> Male and female figures depicted in various iconographic media were often identified as priests and priestesses.

Only the 'palaces' remained unbuilt. The 'palace' society (c.2000-1380 BC) was clearly very advanced in its orderly and bureaucratic organization, showing a strongly rational and practical side with highly developed craft technologies, and yet it also possessed all the imaginative power and childlike freshness of a very young culture."

Palatial institutions were seen as the only regulators of any economic transaction. Acting as redistributive agents, they were thought to draw upon raw materials and labour from the hinterland in order to produce and distribute specialized artisanal goods.  In recent years, however, new perspectives have effectively challenged not only the redistributive role of governing institutions but also the negative attitude towards the existence of market and market-like systems in the Aegean. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_51_GrCrNPa] Once people started looking for them, markets have begun to appear in much earlier chronological horizons, shaping the emergence of state administrative institutions. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_52_GrCrNPa] ( Garraty and Stark 2010). Although there are some constrains in recognizing and understanding markets in prehistoric societies, the market is an economic process which should developed further in Bronze Age Crete.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ food storage sites ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> The only known free-standing storage complexes are the Northeast House at Knossos [MAJIDBENAM_REF_53_GrCrNPa] and the the Bastione at Hagia Triada. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_54_GrCrNPa] Although there is no doubt for the storage function of these complexes, their "public" character is entirely uncertain. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_55_GrCrNPa] Might the Northeast House have been a communal storehouse under the control of the community or of an elite group independent of that residing within the palace, or was it under the control of the central palace authority? A convincing answer to this question cannot be given; it would depend, to a certain extent, on the theoretical context adopted by each scholar in the approach to the Neopalatial polities. Those who see political organization under a heterarchical interpretative scheme would be in favor of a scenario according to which the wealth stored in the complex would be in the hands of the community or a powerful faction competing with the central administration. On the contrary, those who assign an important role to the ruling group residing within the palace, would see government officials as the managers of the stored goods within the setting of the highly specialized Knossian economy. It is highly unlikely that the Northeast House, built close to the palace, the seat of a ruling group that would have controlled many aspects of the daily life of the inhabitants of the city and other centers, would have been an independent storage unit under communal or factional control. The same arguments apply in the case of the Bastione at Hagia Triada.</div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Transport_infrastructure">Transport infrastructure</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Roads ♣present♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Bridges ♣present♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Canals ♣absent♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ports ♣ present♥</b></div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Special_purpose_sites">Special purpose sites</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Mines or quarries ♣ present ♥</b> Stones extracted systematically from quarries were gypsum, porous limestone, and sandstone.
