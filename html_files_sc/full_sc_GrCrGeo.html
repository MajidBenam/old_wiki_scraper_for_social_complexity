Not much is known about either the island's population numbers at the time, or its political organization. In terms of population, very few settlements have been excavated, and none of these have yielded enough data for a credible estimate; in terms of political organization, it is likely that elite families were in charge but not much else could be said.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_GrCrGeo]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> People.

Excavation data and survey information is very limited (especially for the 10th and 9th centuries BCE). [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_GrCrGeo] A large settlement was the center of a sparsely populated territory. Each regional landscape was organized for maximum exploitation of local resources and maximum security.  This large center might represent the first synoecism of local population which will led to the emergence, during the late 8th and early 7th centuries BCE, of small city-states. Interdependence and economic and social cooperation between sites is assumed because of topographic isolation and shared water supplies, agricultural land, and pasture.

Members of local elite families might controlled the administrative sector of the large settlements that arose in Crete during the period. During the Archaic period (710-500 BCE),  political, military and religious control was exercised by the <i>Kosmoi</i>, a board of 3 to 10 nobles annually elected by the <i>Ecclesia</i>, the body of free male citizens.  It is very likely that some aspects of this organization existed since the 8th century BCE.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_GrCrGeo] Sound data indicates that the alphabet was first introduced and developed in Crete and not in Euboea, as some scholars had argued. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_GrCrGeo] The "Cretan theory" has fully confirmed by the recent find of a Cretan inscription at Eltyna (central Crete). [MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_GrCrGeo] The Doric Cretan alphabet was very close to its Phoenician model. This alphabet was also used to express an unknown language that is believed to be the language of the Minoans that was preserved and spoken by some groups in the isolated mountainous regions of east Crete.
