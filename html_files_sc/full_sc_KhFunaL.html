"Les sites archéologiques aujourd'hui associés au Funan sont répartis sur l'ensemble du delta et de la basse vallée du Mékong, des deux côtés de l'actuelle frontière khméro-vietnamienne. On sait par les sources chinoises et par l'épigraphie, confirmées aujourd'hui par les résultats des récentes fouilles archéologiques, qu'ils ont prospéré entre le Ier et le VIe siècle E.C. Les recherches rassemblées par Louis Malleret dans son Archéologie du Delta du Mékong restent à ce jour le point de départ obligé de toute étude archéologique des provinces méridionales du Viêt Nam.

'The chiefs of Funan core a Mon-Khmer title pon, but some were taking Indic names with the suffice -varman, and the later 7th-century inscription suggest that the reason was related to the question of inheritance of accumulated wealth. A pon was chief of a settlement, and the typical pon-dom was a large village, or supra village of several hundred or a thousand or two persons living around or near a pond, sometimes artificial, and growing at least enough rice for self-sufficiency. Some settlements had several pon, perhaps watch one a chief over a hamlet-size community, with one superior to the others within the larger community. The population of each core pon-dom consisted of a lineage or a clan, with its own deity whore representative, and putative descendent, as the pon. Pon-ship was inherited matrilineally through sisters' sons; and there a hierarchy, perhaps informal, of pon, probably based on wealth and political influence. During the florescence of Funan, the greatest wealth would have been accumulated through maritime activity, and it was the coastal pon-doms which would have become most directly involved in sea trade, and their upon were called 'kings' by Chinese visitors.

There was a progressive change in religious cults in the area of Funan, the most radical one being the abandonment of inhumation practices in favour of cremation. The funerary practices incorporated gold leaves decorated with human forms with raised hands, one of which appears to represent Harihara, the combined image of Shiva and Vishnu.  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_76_KhFunaL] This change seems to be in effect toward the 5th century CE, at the same time that Funanese rulers started to take on the Sanskrit honorific title of -varman (protected by, protege of). Indian gods were incorporated into the Funanese pantheon, particularly Siva, Visnu, and Buddha. The phallic symbol that represented Siva, the linga, was perceived as being the essence of the mandala. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_77_KhFunaL]. NOTE: data from ethnographic studies suggest that there was a pre-Indian religious strata that was eventually merged with Indian religions to become what today comprises the Khmer world view. In Khmer culture the world is divided into two landscapes that are marked by physical and psychological borders: the landscape of the village (srok) and the landscape of the wilderness (prei). The srok is the domesticated space of humans; the village, the paddy rice fields, a space of social organization [MAJIDBENAM_REF_78_KhFunaL] that is under the control of a Buddhist king  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_79_KhFunaL]. The prei, on the other hand, is the forest, a place of uncertainty dominated by wild and dangerous spirits [MAJIDBENAM_REF_80_KhFunaL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_81_KhFunaL] beyond the control of Buddhism. This division is not immutable: forests can be cleared to create new srok, and a village may be overtaken by the forest and regain its position as prei. This perception of the world has been identified as the pre-Indian stratum of Khmer culture [MAJIDBENAM_REF_82_KhFunaL]. The term srok is recorded in the inscriptions as sruk, and defines a geographical/administrative entity. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_83_KhFunaL] Currently, the person in charge of establishing dialogues and interactions with the spirits is known as rup [MAJIDBENAM_REF_84_KhFunaL]. It is therefore possible to suggest that before merging Indian and local religions, the early Funanese people may have had a structured religious world view with levels, that is, with the presence of particular people who could act as intermediaries with the spirits. These hierarchical levels increased as the cult to Indian gods were incorporated. (RA's guess).</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Military levels ♣ 2 ♥</b> levels. Following Higham's text, it could be inferred that there was some degree of military organization that seem to imply the presence of different levels. "His son, Pan Pan, had only a brief reign, and was succeeded by a leader of military prowess known to the Chinese as Fan Shiman. He undertook raids against his neighbours, and then mounted a water-borne expedition which subdued over ten chiefs traditionally situated along the shores of the Gulf of Siam." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_85_KhFunaL] Sites like Angkor Borei have not yielded structures that may have been identified as indicators of violence. For example, the wall surrounding the city seems to have served as a "ring-road" and house placements rather than as a defensive structure. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_86_KhFunaL] It is likely then that at the earlier stages of the Funanese polity the chiefs would be in control of a somewhat large group of fighters that eventually became a stratified army as the polity gained complexity.

Similarly, it is unclear if what the chinese identified as army was a real professional army or villagers who were conscripted to fight for their chiefs.

However, Funan’s decline continued, as midway through the sixth century its Khmer vassals to the north broke away, and by the seventh century Funan was no more.

This pattern encouraged communities, as they grew in size and popu- lation numbers, to control water flows, usually by building up earthen dikes to form reservoirs. These banks ring many large Iron Age sites, and where dated, fall within 1 to 400 C.E. During the life of the states of FUNAN and CHENLA, water was retained in rectangular reservoirs known as BARAYS.

'The earliest extant Sanskrit texts, from Cambodia’s Funan period, are undated records from the 5th century: undated Khmer inscriptions appear about a century later. Dated inscriptions in Sanskrit and Old Khmer start from the early 7th century. The Pre-Angkorian Sanskrit texts were generally short ‘literary gestures’ (ibid., 219), but by the Angkorian period, they used very sophisticated poetry, employing polished orthography and grammar, as in India. These display knowledge of Indian intellectual and political thought and of literature including the metrics of poetry (Majumdar 1953: xvii-iii; Bhattacharya 1991: 2-4; Pollock 1996: 218-220; Dagens 2003: 217).'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_148_KhFunaL]</div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Money">Money</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Articles ♣ present ♥</b>The earliest text records a transaction between a chief and his followers in which fruits and animals were given out of respect and adoration,  trend that shifted soon to payment of taxes in luxury goods. Common exchange articles for payment were gold, silver, and scented woods.  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_149_KhFunaL] Later inscriptions suggest the existence of a well developed barter system where cloth and silver were used as the main basis for trade. For example, "the exchange goods given for the land and other gifts is paddy but its value is expressed in terms of silver and cloth which thus appear to have almost monetary value. [...] 'A rice field near the tank of Devacila. The barter for it is paddy. The value of this is 5 ounces of silver and a yau of double cloth'. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_150_KhFunaL]. Other exchange rates are recorded as well: 'honey is given to buy oil, cloth to buy syrup, ... cotton to buy ginger conserve'. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_151_KhFunaL] Although this references are from the late Funanese period, it suggests that there was a developed exchange system.

To be true, the use of cowrie money in Thailand did not end until the latter part of the nineteenth century.
