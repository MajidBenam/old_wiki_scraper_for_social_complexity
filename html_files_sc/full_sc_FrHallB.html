However, since it is an earlier publication will ignore and code the most recent research. In 1995 he does note that Wessex communities reached 1000 km2 in extent.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Territorial scale: "The economic foundations put in place in the ninth and eighth centuries BC were ... incapable of supporting a political scale of integration greater than tens of square kilometers."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_FrHallB][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The Wessex communities seem to have succeeded in organizing polities 1000 km2 in extent" however "Evidence of similar polities is very rare in Europe during the same period."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_FrHallB][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Estimate of 5,000 for fortified center around 600 BCE[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Rather than a small hillfort of just a few hectares, as once believed, we can now see that in the first half of the 6th century BC Heuneburg was an enormous settlement of 100 ha and at least 5,000 inhabitants." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_FrHallB][MAJIDBENAM_BR]However, 2500-800 BCE (European Bronze Age) very low estimate of 100 - but this does cover a long time period[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Each autonomous political community consisted of around a hundred people on average, distributed in five to eight small settlements." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_FrHallB][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Estimates for population in different areas of Europe vary considerably, but many authors work on a figure for the Late Bronze Age of three people per square kilometre on average (Ostoja-Zagórski 1982). In particular areas this may be more or less accurate, but even allowing for low densities in those areas where the carrying capacity of the land was relatively low (for instance in high mountains or dense scrubland) the implications for Europe as a whole are enormous."

Typologies of ceramic and metal objects indicate the fragmentation of previous cultural units. Bronze hoards become more numerous - they are larger and their composition is more varied. Iron working becomes widespread. Rare earlier, iron objects increase rapidly in number during the ninth and eighth centuries BC. ...
