Total area divided by 20 (approximate number of kings). 110,000 / 20 = 5,500 km2 for size of average polity.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Assyrian annals refer to about 20 kings paying tribute following the invasion of 836 BCE and this number roughly corresponds to the number of early Iron Age sites found in the region. "The large number of kings mentioned implies that the area was divided into city-states controlled by autonomous or semi-autonomous rulers. Since Tuatti is referred to by name and apparently held sway over several towns, one suspects that he was the most powerful of these kings."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_TrTabal][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The exact location and extent of the ancient polities remain stubbornly elusive, but sources indicate that greater Tabal was bounded in the north by the southern bend of the Halys River, in the west by Phrygia, in the east by Tilgarimmu, Melid, and Urartu, and in the south by Hilakku and Quwe."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_TrTabal][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The region called Tabal in the Iron Age extended over a large part of south-eastern Anatolia, southwards from the southern curve of the Halys river (Kizil Irmak) toward the Taurus mountains, westwards to the Konya Plain and eastwards towards the anti-Taurus range. The population of the region was very likely a predominantly Luwian one, as it had been throughout the Late Bronze Age and perhaps already in the early second millennium."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_TrTabal][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Tabal covered much of what was called the Lower Land in Late Bronze Age Hittite texts, including the territory of the Classical Tyanitis. Westwards, it extended to the Konya Plain, encompassing the sites now known as Kizildag and Karadag." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_TrTabal][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The Neo-Hittite states varied considerably in size, from a few to several hundred square kilometres. The smaller Tabalian kingdoms are examples of the former, Hamath and Bit-Burutash of the latter." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_TrTabal][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Northern Tabal (Tabal 'Proper') was the largest of the Tabal kingdoms, probably contained sub-regions, "it corresponded roughly to the modern provinces of Kayseri and Nigde."

The only exception is Carchemish, which more than doubled in size compared to the already large Middle and Late Bronze Age settlement ... Therefore, the area within the new fortification wall surrounding the 'lower city' now reached around a hundred hectares. All the other capitals were far smaller in size."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_TrTabal][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Tuwana was the largest and most important kingdom of the southern Tabal region. Its capital is probably to be identified with Classical Tyana (Kemerhisar), 20 km south-west of modern Nigde..."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_TrTabal][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hierarchical_Complexity">Hierarchical Complexity</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ 3 ♥</b> levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1.
