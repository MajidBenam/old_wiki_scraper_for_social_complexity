The frontiers are not only linked to climate and topography, but also to the location of sites. Pontic Mountains can be considered the South border, and similarly, the Taurus Mountains were in the South frontier. The Eastern boundary is the easiest to define: it is a straight line between modern Malatya and Trabzon. Western border is formed by crucial sites like Beycesultan, Demircihöyük, Karataş-Semayük . During Early Bronze Age, some Indo-European nations arrived on this land - this happened around 2300 BCE. Most of the Early Bronze Age II sites in Anatolia saw massive and violent destruction and these disasters brought an end to the EB II period.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ ♥</b>  average of polity within zone needed</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hierarchical_Complexity">Hierarchical Complexity</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ 2 ♥</b>During the Early Bronze Age in Anatolia, many societies developed into more sophisticated urban communities.

Proof of wooden palisades and stone walls was found in Karataş-Semayük, and just stone walls in for example Taurus and Demircihöyük. At Alişar Hüyük, complex fortifications were excavated - a well constructed stronghold wall, and 10 meters of fortification on the terrace. One of these walls was set behind the other, and onto it rectangular-shaped bastions were constructed. A lot of handheld weapons were also found in Central Anatolia Plateau, for example: swords, daggers, pikes, halberds, spears, battle axes and warclubs.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Professions">Professions</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional military officers ♣  ♥</b> unknown</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional soldiers ♣  ♥</b> unknown</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional priesthood ♣  ♥</b>  unknown</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bureaucracy_characteristics">Bureaucracy characteristics</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Full-time bureaucrats ♣  ♥</b> unknown</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Examination system ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Merit promotion ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Specialized government buildings ♣ present ♥</b> Megaron in Karataş - Semayük [MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_TrBrzER] A large, independent megaron structure was constructed on the highest point of the mound, overlooking the settlement.
