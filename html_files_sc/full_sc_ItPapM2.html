These figures are from Black, Gross, and Marino.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_ItPapM2] There should be brackets to reflect disagreement between Bairoch (the only systematic list of urban European demography that I have found), who estimates that Rome contained around 135,000 people in 1700, and more recent estimates in Marino and Black, who also disagree.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_ItPapM2] The first estimate for 1800 is from the complete table Gross[MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_ItPapM2] gives for annual population estimates for the period 1695-1820; the second is from Bairoch.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hierarchical_Complexity">Hierarchical Complexity</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ 4 ♥</b> Rome; large provincial cities (Bologna, Perugia); towns; villages[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1.
