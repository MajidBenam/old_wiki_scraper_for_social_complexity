A lower figure seems more suitable for this period, when papal control over the papal states was less secure and often virtually non-existent due to schisms or rebellions. It remains rough, though, and needs more research (see my August 2014 status report-JFR). -- <i>how do we code unsecurely held territory? to be consistent with coding of other polities we might code the full territory that was, that was claimed and for which effort was expended to be retained? - ET</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]c1200 CE 44,000 [MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ 600,000: 1400 CE; 1,600,000: 1500 CE ♥</b> 900,000: 1400 CE; 1,600,000: 1500 CE This figure is from Black.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_ItPapRn] The population of the papal states was severely affected by the Black Death (1347-49) and subsequent plague cycles (in particular, the plague of 1363 seems to have had a major impact). Black's estimate would make the Papal State roughly equal to that of the Veneto: in the sixteenth century Venice and its Terrafirma were estimated to contain around one and a half million people.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_ItPapRn] Whereas the Veneto was mostly arable flatland in the Po River Valley, much of the Papal States was mountainous and contained dispersed or scarce population, so the total population may have been lower, especially in the immediate aftermath of the plague cycles of 1347-1349 and 1363-1364. Black has estimated that Italy as a whole had around 11 million people in 1500.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_ItPapRn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>ET</i>: McEvedy and Jones estimated that Italy as a whole had around 10,000,000 people in 1500 CE and 7,000,000 in 1400 CE after the Black Death "cut the population back by about a third."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_ItPapRn] The estimate we have for the preceding century is 300,000-1,500,000. 900,000 (mid-point figure) minus a third gives an estimate of 600,000 for 1400 CE.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ [25,000-33,000]: 1400 CE; 55,000: 1500 CE ♥</b> Rome remained the largest settlement in the Papal States during this period, although the population of the city plummeted drastically following the 1527 Sack of Rome.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_ItPapRn] Partner[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_ItPapRn] has estimated a slightly lower population count for Rome around 1400, stating that its population was around 25,000 people.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hierarchical_Complexity">Hierarchical Complexity</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ [4-5] ♥</b> The papal palace complexes within Rome; Rome; large provincial cities (Bologna, Perugia); towns; villages[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Papal palace complexes: The papal palaces in Rome-especially the Lateran and the Vatican-contained increasingly large bureaucracies, especially after the end of the Schism in 1417 and the return of a single, unitary papacy to Rome.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1. Rome: Rome contained between 30,000 and 55,000 people during this period, and was unquestionably the largest city of the papal states.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]2. Large provincial cities: Bologna was the second city of the papal states in every way; next to Rome, it was the largest town, contained a venerable university, and was the socio-economic center of the Romagna region.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_ItPapRn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div>3. towns: Towns such as Ancona, Orvieto, or Terracina contained between 10,000 and 20,000 people, and often served as administrative centers for provincial government.</div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div><div>4. villages: Market towns or small towns such as Iesi in the Marche region; these often were little more than a population center with a market, parish church, and the local lord's castle. An example of a small village of this nature which grew into a larger town is Loreto, also in le Marche: because of the shrine to the Holy House of the Virgin, it grew into a pilgrimage site during the 16th century.</div></div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div><div><div>(5.

Pope: The pope remained the head of a vast bureaucracy and leader of the papal state, despite ongoing weakness on the ground during the fifteenth century. Some popes, however, such as John XXIII and Julius II, were effective administrators and military leaders.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]2. Cardinals and legates: The cardinalate had increased in number from 24 (the limit set by the Council of Constance, 1414-1418) to 35 by 1500 or so.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_ItPapRn] By this period, the cardinals were a fundamental part of papal elections and crucial to the politics of the papal states. Legates-often, themselves, cardinals-handled diplomatic business outside of the papal states. The cardinals' palaces in Rome were in effect sub-headquarters of the papal bureaucracy.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div>3. The <i>curia</i>: By the late 14th century, the papal bureaucracy had become a massive, complex machine founded on bribery, the sale of offices, and patronage politics.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_ItPapRn] Papal officials operated in Avignon until 1378, returning with the papacy to Rome. During the fifteenth century, the sale of offices within the <i>curia</i> became routinized; Peterson has estimated that under Pope Leo X (1513-1521), two thousand offices were for sale in the city of Rome alone.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_ItPapRn]</div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div>3. Rectors, counts, and dukes: These were the clerical officials sent out by the papacy to the provinces of the Papal State, or secular lords appointed as <i>signori</i> (lords) of regions of the State.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_ItPapRn] During the Great Schism, the <i>signori</i> were functionally independent of any higher authority.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_ItPapRn]</div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Senators of Rome: It is unclear whether this was a continuous office, or a ceremonial appointment for distinguished foreigners influential in papal politics.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div><div>4. Castellans, village leaders: I use this category to denote minor officials in the provinces of the papal states, who often were appointed locally.</div></div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]_Provincial_[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Signorie<div>Partner has characterized the situation in the Papal State during the fifteenth century thus: "It remained true [in the mid-15th century] that the Papal State was divided into war-like little <i>signorie</i> to an extent unknown in any other region of Italy."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_ItPapRn] These lordships relied on utilizing their male subjects as mercenary troops, as the Malatesta of Urbino. The popes could occasionally intervene against these petty lords, but the Papal State would not attain internal cohesion and administration (to a limited extent) until the sixteenth century. Despite this internal weakness, the papacy was strong enough that the Papal State was one of the five guarantor powers of the Peace of Lodi (1454), which established an unprecedented era of peace and cooperation between the Italian powers (the papacy, Florence, Milan, Venice, and the Kingdom of Naples).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_ItPapRn]</div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious levels ♣ 5 ♥</b> Pope; Cardinals and legates; archbishops; bishops and abbots; parish priests and members of the religious orders; deacons.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1. Pope: The pope was, of course, the universally-acknowledged leader of Latin Christendom. This does not contradict the fact that who exactly was the legitimate pope was often contested during the period 1378-1418, during the Great Schism. During this period the papacy arrogated to itself the right to appoint bishops, negating the tradition of bishops being elected by their flock in conjunction with the priesthood.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_42_ItPapRn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]2. Cardinals and legates: The cardinalate was crucial in theological decision-making and the religious aspects of papal government; legates, similarly, handled religious matters abroad on occasion.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div>3. Archbishops: To a certain extent, archbishops were equivalent to cardinals, but there were more of them, distributed throughout Christendom. They supervised their suffragan bishops and bishoprics, while also overseeing their own (a good example is the Archbishop of Milan).</div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div><div>4. Bishops and abbots: Bishops were the crucial link between local religion and the papacy. There were 263 bishoprics in  14th century Italy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_43_ItPapRn] Abbots sometimes played a role beyond the walls of their monasteries, although by this point once-powerful regional centers such as Farfa were in decline in Lazio.</div></div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div><div><div>5. Parish priests and members of the religious orders: These constituted the mundane religious level. Parish priests embodied Christianity for their flock, for the most part, since they said Mass, heard confession and, in general, were (supposed to) serve as the quotidian face of the organized Church. Members of the religious orders (Franciscans, Dominicans, and so forth) also were a common part of the Church's presence, especially in the towns.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_44_ItPapRn]</div></div></div></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Military levels ♣ 5 ♥</b> Pope; legates and rectors; counts and <i>signori</i>; mercenary leaders; rank and file.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1. Pope. The pope was the nominally supreme leader of all military efforts in the Papal States. Usually military campaigns were carried out by papally-appointed vicars or rectors such as Cardinal Albornoz, who was brutally effective in subduing le Marche and the Romagna in the 1350s and 1360s.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_45_ItPapRn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]2. Legates, rectors:: These were usually the leaders of papal levies and conducted sieges, planned battles, and so forth. Functionally there was little difference between them and mercenary leaders employed by the papacy, although the legates were usually more loyal to the Church.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div>3. counts, <i>signori</i>: There's a bit of fuzziness between this level and the "mercenary leader" level, since many ex-mercenaries set themselves up as petty lords within the Papal State.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_46_ItPapRn]</div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div><div>4. Mercenary leaders: The <i>condottieri</i>-men such as John Hawkwood-were notoriously unreliable. The Florentines were able to buy Hawkwood away from the Papacy in 1375 for 130,000 florins.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_47_ItPapRn] Although standing armies were emerging by the mid-15th century,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_48_ItPapRn] mercenary bands were the most frequent military units in Italian warfare. The papacy, in fact, was the main employer of these mercenaries.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_49_ItPapRn]</div></div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div><div><div>5. Individual soldiers.

These mercenaries, the <i>condottieri</i>, were notorious for changing sides, sometimes on the battlefield. During the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, papal armies were supplemented by French and Spanish troops, following the 1494 invasion of Italy.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]From 1378 until the end of the Great Schism in 1417, mercenary warbands, the <i>condottieri</i>, were often in control of the papal states.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_52_ItPapRn] Composed of foreign and Italian mercenaries, these companies refined extortion and betrayal to an art form.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_53_ItPapRn] Some of the most successful of these mercenaries set themselves up as lords (<i>signori</i>) in the Papal State, in particular in the Romagna.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_54_ItPapRn]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional priesthood ♣ present ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bureaucracy_characteristics">Bureaucracy characteristics</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Full-time bureaucrats ♣ present ♥</b> The bureaucracy was composed largely of men who had purchased their offices, or procured them through nepotism and cronyism, but they served full time.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Examination system ♣ absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Merit promotion ♣ present ♥</b> Patron-clientele networks, nepotism, and political considerations played a major role in advancement, yet merit was still a factor in the government of the Papal States; this was usually the determining criterion in the case of non-Italian bureaucrats and administrators, such as Cardinal Albornoz.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_55_ItPapRn] The code should be bracketed in the future, to reflect the existence of merit promotion within a general system in which nepotism and cronyism were the norm.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Specialized government buildings ♣ present ♥</b> I count here papal fortified enclaves (such as Castel Sant'Angelo) and palaces as specialized government buildings.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Law">Law</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Formal legal code ♣ present ♥</b> Canon law and Roman law were in use in Latin Christian Europe, and in particular in the Papal State.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_56_ItPapRn]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Judges ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Courts ♣ present ♥</b> Courts of various kinds functioned through the State, with voluminous surviving trial records.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_57_ItPapRn]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional Lawyers ♣ present ♥</b> Around 43 percent of cardinals in the period 1512-1519 had a legal background, and canonists and Roman-law lawyers were essential to the papal administration.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_58_ItPapRn]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Specialized_Buildings:_polity_owned">Specialized Buildings: polity owned</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ irrigation systems ♣ present ♥</b> Commercialization of rural hinterland began 1050-1100 CE.
