Captains, commanders, colonels [MAJIDBENAM_REF_46_FrBurbE] “Parma commanded a disciplined, professional army in contrast to Henry’s largely volunteer forces, at least where the nobility were concerned.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_47_FrBurbE] Between 1610 and 1652, French military officers were lured to the Netherlands for expert training from the Dutch. Here the most important innovation was the incorporation of drill and discipline to control a large standing army. 1652 the Royal Army created, consisting of professional officers and soldiers, marking the first major step becoming a “premier land force in Europe.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_48_FrBurbE]  Until the changes of the mid-1600s, “the officer corps reflected a unique culture of command based upon aristocratic values that attracted young nobles to the service but limited the professionalization of the army.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_49_FrBurbE] For example, there came a need to commission rich men because of their wealth and credit were required for the proper maintenance of units, which came a at a cost to the professionalization of both officer and soldier. “The state never mastered the ability to pay for its own army.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_50_FrBurbE] Despite efforts to create a more professional military by moving through the seventeenth century culture of command, by the close of the grand siècle, the French officer straddled archaic values of aristocratic honor and independence, on one side, and new standards of professional competence and hierarchy, on the other. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_51_FrBurbE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional soldiers ♣ present ♥</b> Lynn notes that armies of the fifteenth, sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries were assembled for particular campaigns from a combination of native French units, foreign hired mercenary bands (usually Swiss) and the private armies of major nobles who offered their services in exchange for money or favor. This is known an “aggregate contract army” rather than a standing army composed of professional officers and soldiers. “The quality of the foreign mercenaries was much higher than the far less professional French.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_52_FrBurbE] According to historian Henrico Davila, Henry IV was the General of a volunteer army [MAJIDBENAM_REF_53_FrBurbE]  in addition to the hired mercenaries. Lynn notes that “the French army, particularly its infantry, had once been an aggregate of temporary mercenary units and private forces raised by grandees, but by the mid-1600s, it had become the province of the King alone, a royal instrument with a large permanent establishment directly commanded by the monarch,” and yet, “ostensibly voluntary enlistment provided most of the recruits.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_54_FrBurbE] “The state never mastered the ability to pay for its own army.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_55_FrBurbE] According to Mears, it was not until later that professionalism came under regular control. “In 1670, a uniform scale of pay was laid down for each branch of the service, and what was more important, the pay was actually forthcoming.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_56_FrBurbE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional priesthood ♣ present ♥</b> 1620s were a turning point in terms of ecclesiastic growth, reaching a peak in the 1630s with nine out of every ten bishops being ordained priests, “and thereby fully committed to ecclesiastical careers.” Bergin also notes that the decision to be ordained a priest could never really be divorced from career prospects, especially that of the episcopate itself. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_57_FrBurbE] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_58_FrBurbE] Essentially, the transformation of parish priests into liturgical performers was also part of this larger effort to professionalize the secular clergy during the second half of the seventeenth century. In addition, by 1640 a new professional identity for priesthood was being forged through seminary education.
