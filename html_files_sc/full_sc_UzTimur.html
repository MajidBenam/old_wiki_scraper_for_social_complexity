Estimate reasoning: 94.0m for whole of the Indian Subcontinent. If 60% population of India c500 BCE was in the Ganges Basin (67% under the Guptas) and "The next fifteen hundred years consolidated without significantly altering this pattern"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_UzTimur] then about 56.0m should be within the Ganges Basin. Timur held only about 50% of the Ganges Basin so for this territory we could estimate 28.0m. Of the 38.0 remaining for the rest of the sub-continent it is likely the Indus Basin contains the majority. If 60% of remaining is in the Indus Basin then we could say 23.0m for the whole Indus Basin. Timur held the north of the Indus Basin so for this territory we could estimate 12.0m.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ 150,000 ♥</b> Inhabitants.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Samarkand 1400 CE: 150,000 according to Clavijo.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_UzTimur][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Apogee of Herat was in the twelfth century: "al Qazwini wrote ... there were twelve thousand shops in the markets, six thousand hot baths and 659 colledges.

However, these figures are considered an exaggeration. Marco Polo described a cosmopolitan city which contained Armenians, Nestorians, Jacobites, Georgians and Persians. According to Rashid ad-Din it was a city of high culture with "philosophers, astronomers, scholars, historians - of all religions, of all sects". Other peoples included Indians, Kashmiris, Chinese, Uighurs, Arabs, Franks, Turks and Tibetans.
