The source of these novelties is unknown, although we can say that they did not involve any fundamental shift in the form or general layout of either houses or pottery.

We have suggested that extraordinary settlement clustering resulted from a clumping of population around a rare conjunction of highly desirable features (Pl. 8)  : excellent rice-growing soils, levees for pasture in the flood season, deep basin for pasture in the dry season and access to both major river channels and the entire inland system of secondary and tertiary marigots from communication and trade."

We could hypothesize that Djenne started out as a political, military and ritual center which controlled the economic center at Jenne-Jeno, until Djenne took that over itself. However, this is my speculation. R and S McIntosh says: "Analyses conducted thus far have not yielded any information on the possible reasons for the new settlement at Djenné."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_55_MlJeJe4]</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/>"First, where are the elites, the chiefs, the kings, the early state bureaucracies? In other words, who keeps the peace? This is the first fundamental complaint raised by the distinctiveness of these towns with the traditional 'hierarchy as adaptive solution' approach to emerging complex society. To date, excavation at sites such as Jenne-jeno reveals no obvious signs of social stratification, as opposed to abundant evidence of (horizontal) social complexification. Where are the public buildings, the monuments, the shrines to state ideologies that classic preindustrial city theory tells use should be present? One has the strong impression of a highly complex society, with multiple overlapping and competing agencies of authority and decision making, and of resistance to centralization. The city's lay-out - the dispersed cluster - was an instrument of that resistance."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_56_MlJeJe4][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"This assertion that heterarchy, rather than hierarchy, is the better description of authority at these cities recalls persistent Mande notions of who has decision-making roles in society, notions very familiar to historians, social anthropologists and art historians. Authority is shared amongst many corporate groups rather than being the monopoly of a charismatic individual (in Weber's sense) or of one bureaucratic lineage."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_57_MlJeJe4][MAJIDBENAM_BR]There is no evidence of a hierarchical social system[MAJIDBENAM_REF_58_MlJeJe4] Jenne-jeno was "a large, complex, but non-coercive urban settlement."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_59_MlJeJe4] "the demands of specialization pushed groups apart while the requirements of a generalized economy pulled them together ... created a dynamism that ensured growth and the establishment of urban settlements. And they were non-coercive settlements. Groups congregated by choice. This is an instance of transformation from a rural to an urban society that did not establish a hierarchical society and coercive centralized control... The process in the delta and at Jenne-jeno in particular, was one of 'complexification' rather than centralization."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_60_MlJeJe4][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Clan[MAJIDBENAM_BR](General reference for West African states) "the basic social and political unit appears in the past to have been the small local group, bound together by ties of kinship.
