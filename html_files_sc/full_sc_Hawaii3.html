However, if higher estimates of the archipelago’s population (400,000, possibly more than 800,000 [MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_Hawaii3]) are correct, perhaps the 1794 fleet really did contain 150,000-200,000 men.&lt;br\“By the late seventeenth century, four main polities had emerged, focused on the main islands of Kaua’i, O’ahu, Maui, and Hawai’i, with the fought-over smaller islands being incorporated into one or another of the main units.

Royal/chiefly centre[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div>2. Dispersed households</div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Hawai'i lacked anything approaching urban centers, and although there were substantial differences in population density corresponding to an uneven topographic distribution of soil and hydrologic resources (see discussion that follows), the general trend was of dispersed households, each occupying and farming its own adjacent plots. Moreover, while the commoners were sedentary on their lands, the ali'i were known to move about in relation to available food stocks. This peripatetic pattern of chiefly movement is well described, and underlies the metaphor of the chief as a “shark who travels on the land” (He manōholo ̒āina ke ali'i; Pukui 1983:87: Proverb 799). Nonetheless, there were distinct chiefly and royal centers, marked by concentrations of larger residences adjacent to temples of the main state cults of Kū and Lono. [...] Surrounding the king's own extensive household compound were the residential courts of several principal ali'i and advisors, the houses of warriors, and the main Hale o Lono or temple to the god in whose name the annual tribute was collected. While this settlement plan has certain innovations reflecting Western contact (notably the gun drilling (p.51) field and the shipyard), in most respects it was probably typical of royal courtly centers in the late precontact era."

Among his chief duties was to oversee the royal storehouses 'in which to collect food, fish, tapa [barkcloth], malo [loincloths], pa-u [female skirts], and all sorts of goods' (Malo 1951:195). Only the kālaimoku had the regular privilege of holding secret meetings with the king, and he controlled the access of other al'i to royal audiences."

Ali'i-'ai-moku<div>"The districts (moku) into which the kingdom was divided were each under the control of a major chief of high rank, called the ali'i-'ai-moku. The operative term 'ai in this compound term has the core meaning of both 'food' and 'eat' but with metaphoric extensions connoting to 'consume,' 'grasp,' or 'hold onto' (Pukui and Elbert 1986:9). Thus the figurative extension of 'ai includes 'to rule, reign, or enjoy the privileges and exercise the responsibilities of rule.' The term ali'i-'ai-moku might thus be simply translated 'ruler of the moku,' but as in many Hawaiian expressions there are layers of kaona, 'hidden meanings', folded in.

Rather, the administration of the ahupua'a, including its various ̒ili subdivisions, was put into the hands of a konohiki, a resident “land manager” who acted on behalf of the ali'i-'ai-ahupua'a. Konohiki were, in fact, often lower-ranked members of the al'i class (such as kaukau ali'i), frequently junior collaterals of the ahupua'a chiefs themselves."

Other types include healing experts, sorcerers, and prophets [MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_Hawaii3].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1. Kahuna nui<div>The kahuna nui was the most important of the kahuna pule (see below), as he "carried the responsibilities for the king's religious duties and looked after his temples and main gods." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_Hawaii3]</div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div>2. Kahuna pule<div>"The priests who officiated at temples controlled by the king and major chiefs were the kahuna pule. These were subdivided into a number of specific orders or cults, especially those pertaining to Kū and Lono (mo'o Kū and mo'o Lono). These priests were drawn from high-ranking elite families, typically of papa rank (in which the person's mother comes from one of the three highest ranks)."

Three other proposed laws, against rum selling, prostitution, and gambling, were drawn up, to be explained and taught to the people before they should be adopted. It was agreed that the chiefs should meet six months later to continue their consultation upon the subject. The three laws adopted and the three proposed were printed together on one sheet, which bears the date December 8, 1827. On December 14, the people were assembled in a coconut grove near the fort; the three enacted laws were formally proclaimed, and the king, Kaahumanu, and Boki exhorted the people, both native and foreign, to obey the three laws which had been adopted and to give attention to the three which were not yet enacted."

Food storage sheds were called hale papa’a. All scholars agree that these provisions were intended for redistribution, but it is unclear to whom. Sahlins[MAJIDBENAM_REF_57_Hawaii3] implies that the food was redistributed to the people, including commoners. But Kirch[MAJIDBENAM_REF_58_Hawaii3] states that the food was redistributed almost entirely to other chiefs, lesser chiefs, retainers, etc., with only token amounts, at most, going to commoners. He also states that food storage was difficult given the climate and kinds of crops that Hawaiians cultivated, so chiefs had to physically travel to different areas of their chiefdoms in order to exact tribute, rather than being able to store all of the tribute in a central location[MAJIDBENAM_REF_59_Hawaii3]. Meanwhile, Valeri states that none of the tribute was redistributed to the commoners[MAJIDBENAM_REF_60_Hawaii3].
