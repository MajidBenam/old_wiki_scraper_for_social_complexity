One might hypothesise that the new "social roles linked to community defense, organization of labor, and communal storage of maize in secure central places"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_67_USCahoL] of the earlier Emergent Mississippian were developed into something more formal and institutional in this period but this does not necessarily mean a state bureaucracy with full-time officials responsible to a king.
