Adams proposed estimations for northern and southern enclaves. The southern enclaves had 20,110 inhabitants and the northern enclave had 38,540 people in Early-Middle Uruk Period. The northern enclave had 21,300 people and southern enclave had 41,020 people in the Late Uruk period[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_IqUruk*] The available data concerns also the Susiana Plain. The population of whole Uruk polities is unknown.

The exact number of administrative levels is difficult to established for the Uruk period, however the researchers deeply believed that administration must have been development and was rather elaborated than simple. These assumptions are based mainly on written records. The vast majority of known tablets are related to administration and use for administration purpose (e.g. as a list of counted goods).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_IqUruk*] Moreover, the scrutinized analysis of seals and sealings from sites such as Tepe Gawra, Niniveh proved that the administrative system became more centralized starting from the Middle Uruk Period and focused on 'control of local movements and storage of goods'. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_IqUruk*] Moreover, some researchers emphasize that elaborated settlement hierarchy must equal elaborated administrative level: ,influential idea was that at least <b>three tiers</b> of settlement within one settlement system represented an underlying administrative structure with at least <b>three levels of hierarchy</b>.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_IqUruk*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious levels ♣ ♥</b> levels.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Military levels ♣ ♥</b> levels.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Professions">Professions</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional military officers ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> Full-time specialists</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional soldiers ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> Full-time specialists</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional priesthood ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> Full-time specialists</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bureaucracy_characteristics">Bureaucracy characteristics</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Full-time bureaucrats ♣ absent ♥</b> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_IqUruk*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Examination system ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Merit promotion ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Specialized government buildings ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Though administrative artifacts have been found dating to the entire Uruk sequence (see e.g. Pollock 1992, 314-320 for a summary), sources do not indicate that these artifacts have been found in buildings that appeared to specialise in administrative activities; instead, whenever sources associate these kinds of artifacts to a specific kind of building, it is a building that likely also fulfilled ritual functions, e.g.:"Seeking to reconcile the tripartite floor plan of many of the Eanna buildings with the widespread evidence for contemporary administrative activities found in their general vicinity (below), many archaeologists refer to the Eanna structures simply as 'religious/administrative' in nature."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_IqUruk*]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Law">Law</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Formal legal code ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Judges ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Courts ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional Lawyers ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Specialized_Buildings:_polity_owned">Specialized Buildings: polity owned</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ irrigation systems ♣ present ♥</b>[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_IqUruk*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ drinking water supply systems ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> Is there a piped network that connects the drinking water to individual settlements?</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ markets ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ food storage sites ♣ present♥</b> The big granaries were uncovered at many sites dated to Uruk Period.</div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Transport_infrastructure">Transport infrastructure</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Roads ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Bridges ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Canals ♣ present ♥</b> irrigation canals[MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_IqUruk*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ports ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Special_purpose_sites">Special purpose sites</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Mines or quarries ♣ present ♥</b>e.g. copper mines at Ergani in Late Uruk Period[MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_IqUruk*]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Information">Information</span></h3><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Writing_System">Writing System</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Mnemonic devices ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Nonwritten records ♣ present ♥</b> e. g. pottery decoration, seals, sealings as the expression of symbolic language and ideology[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_IqUruk*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Written records ♣ present ♥'</b>archaic text' from Eanna levels at Uruk and c. 5000 tablets are available from this period, however most of them are dated to Late Uruk Period.
