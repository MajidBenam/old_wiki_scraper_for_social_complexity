However, from information on the Emperor's administration [MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_InChaBd], the following rough hierarchy may be inferred:[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1. Capital<div>2. Provincial centre<div>3.

Emperor [MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_InChaBd].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]_Court_[MAJIDBENAM_BR]2. <i>Sandhivigrahika</i> (Minister of War and Peace)<div>This is the only minister in the Emperor's council mentioned explicitly in Chalukya inscriptions, and there is much evidence that this was the most powerful of the ministers [MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_InChaBd]. Indeed, it seems that, on at least one occasion, the <i>sandhivigrahika</i> also held the post of "chief of the secretariat" (<i>divirapati</i>) and was in charge of revenue administration (<i>akshapataladhikaranadhipati</i>) [MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_InChaBd].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]3. Other ministers<div>Records here are a bit fuzzy. These "ministers and other administrators" may include the keeper of records, a guru, as well as the Crown Prince [MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_InChaBd] and other loyal members of the royal family, including the Queen [MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_InChaBd]. And, presumably, the <i>divirapati</i> and the <i>akshapataladhikaranadhipati</i> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_InChaBd], in those occasions where they were not titles held by the <i>sandhivigrahika</i>.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]4. Administrative officials<div>The long list of administrative officials includes: <i>diviras</i> (clerks) and <i>akshapatalikas</i> (revenue officers) [MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_InChaBd]; <i>baladhirkta</i> or <i>mahabaladhirtkas</i> (military officials with administrative duties); <i>dutakas</i> (in charge of conveyance of royal grants); <i>durgapatis</i> (fort administrators); <i>dandapasika</i> and <i>chauradhikarana</i> (in charge of crime and punishment); <i>chatas</i> and <i>batas</i> (possibly police-like officers); <i>vasavakas</i> (in charge of arranging the residences of touring officials and foreigners); <i>viniyuktakas</i> (unclear); <i>gamagamikas</i> (supervised egress and ingress of travellers, including inspecting "passports") [MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_InChaBd][MAJIDBENAM_BR]5.<div>e.g. senior batas?[MAJIDBENAM_BR]6.<div>e.g. batas?</div></div></div></div></div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/>_Provincial Government_[MAJIDBENAM_BR]2.

Rajasamantas or "Governors"<div>Defeated rulers whom the Emperor trusted to keep in charge of their territories, now made into <i>vishayas</i>, or provinces [MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_InChaBd]. It is not entirely clear, from the source, whether <i>rajasamanta</i> and "governor" are the same office.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]3. Samantas<div>Feudal subordinates of the <i>rajasamantas</i>, they provided troops and tribute to the Emperor when required [MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_InChaBd].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]4. Town assemblies<div>Made up of elders (<i>mahajanas</i>), guild chiefs, <i>mahallakas</i>, and "head of business communities" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_InChaBd].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]5. Village administration<div>Made up of <i>mahajanas</i> (elders), <i>mahattaras</i>, <i>mahattaradhikarins</i> and <i>gavundas</i> (royal representatives) [MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_InChaBd]. There also existed "gramabhogikas" or "village leaders" and <i>karanas</i> or "village accountants"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_InChaBd], but it is unclear what their position was in relation to other village administrators.</div></div></div></div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/><b>♠ Religious levels ♣ 5 ♥</b> levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]_Hinduism_[MAJIDBENAM_BR]There are no official priestly hierarchies in Hinduism [MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_InChaBd]. However, several sources allude to the importance, at least for some branches of the religion, of the relationship between student and teacher or guru (e.g. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_InChaBd]), which suggests that perhaps it would not be entirely inappropriate to say that there is indeed a Hindu religious hierarchy, and that it is composed of two levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]_Jainism_[MAJIDBENAM_BR]NOTE: I have found two equally authoritative sources on Jain hierarchy:[MAJIDBENAM_BR](1) [MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_InChaBd][MAJIDBENAM_BR]1. <i>Arihants</i> (ones who have conquered their inner enemies)<div>2. <i>Siddhas</i> (Liberated Ones)<div>3. <i>Acharyas</i> (who head the Order)<div>4. <i>Upadhyays</i> (who teach the message)<div>5. <i>Sadhus</i> (Monks/Seekers)</div></div></div></div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR](2) [MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_InChaBd][MAJIDBENAM_BR]1.

Nuns</div></div></div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]_Buddhism_[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Buddhist monastic communities replaced the caste system with one based on year of ordination. Previously ordained monks enjoyed rights and privileges higher in status than monks ordained later, and monks were categorically of higher status and privilege than nuns. In effect seniority and gender provided criteria for social status and increased access to 'pure' teachings and exemption from 'impure' duties."
