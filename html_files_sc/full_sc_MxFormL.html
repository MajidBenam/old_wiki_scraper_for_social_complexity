During the Late Formative (c. 650-200 BC), MxFormL includes the regions of Cuauhtitlan, Teotihuacan, Texcoco, Ixtapalapa, and its center of gravity in the Chalco region. The area of the Cuicuilco polity in the southwest Basin of Mexico (Tacuba and Xochimilco) and the uninhabited northern regions (Zumpango and Temascalapa) are the only parts of the Late Formative Basin of Mexico NGA not included in the MxFormL quasi-polity. Although these are discrete settlement clusters with spatial buffer zones between them, the entire 2250 km<sup>2</sup> area outlined in red in the Terminal Formative Map was designated the maximal area of the MxFormL quasi-polity. The date range c.650-400 BC was chosen for this maximal territory because it safely precedes the suggested period of Cuicuilco's territorial expansion c.400-1 BCE. The chronology and characteristics of Cuicuilco's expansion (c.400-1 BCE) and Teotihuacan's expansion (c.200-1 BCE) are very poorly understood beyond the general scholarly consensus that the Basin of Mexico was entirely divided between Cuicuilco and Teotihuacan by sometime in the Terminal Formative.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_MxFormL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> people.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ 20,000 ♥</b> Inhabitants. "At its height (400 to 100 BCE), Cuilcuilco covered at least 400 ha [...] with a population that Sanders et al. (1979; 99,193) estimate to have been at least 20,000".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_MxFormL] The following refers to earlier candidates. The largest Late Formative site in the MxFormL quasi-polity is in the Chalco region (CH-LF-5), with an estimated population of 5200 people. Within the same settlement cluster, 2 km away (separated only by the current course of the Tlalmanalco River and the modern settlements of San Lorenzo Tlamimilopa and San Mateo Tezoquipan), is CH-LF-6 with an estimated 3400 people.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_MxFormL] Given their close proximity within a single settlement cluster, and their separation by urban development and thousands of years of alluviation, it is likely that these two sites are a single settlement.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_42_MxFormL] As such, I present the range with and without their combination for the date c.200 BCE (the end/culmination of the Late Formative period). The same two sites are the largest during the Terminal Formative period, re-designated CH-TF-14 and CH-TF-16, with population of 4000 and 2200, respectively.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_43_MxFormL] As such, I present the range with and without their combination for the date c.100 BCE -- which is intended to represent the date of their independent zenith before being taken over by Cuicuilco.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_44_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_45_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_46_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_47_MxFormL]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hierarchical_Complexity">Hierarchical Complexity</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ [3-4] ♥</b> levels. "A minimum of three size grades is therefore observable in housing during the later Formative: palatial candidates at the largest cities, elite residencies at midtier towns, and common residencies across the settlement spectrum".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_48_MxFormL] Some settlement clusters have a 3-tier settlement hierarchy, while others have a 4-tier settlement hierarchy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_49_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_50_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_51_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Late Formative[MAJIDBENAM_BR](1) Regional Center -- 3,000-10,000 inhabitants<div>(2) Large Village -- 1,000-3,000 inhabitants<div>(3) Small Village -- 100-1,000 inhabitants<div>(4) Hamlet -- 10-100 inhabitants</div></div></div></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Administrative levels ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> levels.

Political and religious institutions are thought to be essentially identical for the Central Mexican Highlands Late/Terminal Formative, such that political power was inherently theocratic.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_55_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_56_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_57_MxFormL] At least 3 hierarchical levels of religious institutions can be discerned for Cuicuilco. First, formal religious ritual at the household/house-group level (i.e. local corporate/Kin groups, the the basal units of exchange and production) is ubiquitous for the Central Mexican Highlands Late/Terminal Formative, and these are thought to have organized the basal level of the political economy. This has been inferred from the ubiquitous household/house-group shrines and ritual offerings, which are associated with senior lineage houses in house compounds. Compared to junior lineage houses, senior lineage houses also have higher quantities of prestige goods, food storage, obsidian/lithic production, burials, larger houses/rooms, greater architectural quality and ornamentation, and greater occupational time depth. Given that these same ritual tropes are replicated at higher hierarchical levels, it has been inferred that senior lineage religious-ritual authority in access to ancestors was the basis of political-economic authority at the basal house-group (kin/corporate group) level.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_58_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_59_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_60_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_61_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_62_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_63_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_64_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_65_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_66_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_67_MxFormL] Second, formal settlement- or community-level religious rituals (i.e. wider groupings of hierarchically-ordered kin/corporate-groups) were associated with feasting sponsored by religious/political elites, ritual labor service (production/construction), and sacrificial offerings. Evidence for these religious institutions are centered on settlements' ceremonial precincts (temples and plazas), which directly associate them with the priestly elite and the political economy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_68_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_69_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_70_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_71_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_72_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_73_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_74_MxFormL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_75_MxFormL]
