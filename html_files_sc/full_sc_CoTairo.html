Typical size of one independent Tairona polity estimated for the Upper Buritaca region on the basis of this:  "Later work in Ciudad Perdida and the Upper Buritaca river basin supports this argument, since Ciudad Perdida is connected by flagstoned paths to at least twenty five other sites of varying sizes within a seven kilometer radius (Soto 1988)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_CoTairo]  This would give us an area of about 150 sq km.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]NGA Territory (all Tairona polities): between 3000 and 6,420 sq km. 6,420 is an estimate calculated using Google Area calculator and the above map [MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Not surprisingly, prehispanic societies took advantage of this river and its resources, including the Muisca, Tierradentro, San Agustin/ Alto Magdalena, and Tairona chiefdoms of Colombia. In general, these chiefdoms exhibited two-tier settlement systems, composed of multiple primary centers with associated second-level communities. Based on current evidence, these primary centers shared cultural styles but retained political independence; for example, there was no single “capital” of the Muisca, Tierradentro, San Agustin/Alto Magdalena, or Tairona chiefdoms. Further, these individual chiefdoms were relatively small, sometimes less than 100 km (60 miles) across, forming a complex political mosaic in Colombia." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]" These little known polities and their predecessors actively modified the landscape of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia from A.D. 200 until their disappearance around A.D. 1600 at the hands of disease, displacement, and war. In this time however, they built extensive networks of flagstone-paved roads and trails, irrigation and water channeling systems, terraced agricultural fields, and large stone masonry towns over a mountainous area comprising more than three thousand square kilometers, nine different biomes, and altitudes ranging from sea level to 3000 meters elevation." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_42_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"By 1498, when Spanish explorer Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo anchored in the Bay of Santa Marta to trade steel axes for gold, more than two hundred and fifty Tairona villages and towns with stone masonry and rammed earth architecture could be found throughout the Sierra, from the shore line to altitudes above 2500 meters, covering an area of approximately five thousand square kilometers."

Projections made on very rough population numbers calculated by the Spanish authorities around 1593 suggest that at the time of contact with Europeans, at least 250,000 people inhabited the northern and western portions of the Sierra Nevada. Dever's (2007: 207) more recent calculations estimate population densities to be around 120 people per km2, which give us a total of 360,000 persons for an area of approximately 3000 km2. Less conservative estimates place the number at around 500,000 (Restrepo 1953). Given the fact that new sites continue to be found on a yearly basis or become visible as large swaths of forest in the Sierra Nevada are cut down for ranching and cultivation, it is quite possible that even these less conservative figures may be a low estimate."

Serje estimated 1500 people.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Population estimate for Pueblito: "By AD 1000-1100, the Neguanje village was a tight cluster of residences organized around the major streams, and reached a size of approximately five hectares. If one takes into account the outlying residences, though it is still not clear if we can consider them to be part of the village or not, the area increases to about ten hectares. Despite these reservations, it seems likely that people living some distance from the main settlement cluster had some sort of relationship with the villagers, regardless of whether these residential units may or may not be considered a part of it. How fast or how slowly did the village expand at this point in time? This question cannot be answered by way of the data recovered through the shovel tests, but I will certainly address it in the next chapter, since excavations in the core area allowed us to gain a better sense of the speed and tempo of expansion during this early period. Population densities for the Neguanje village were very probably less than the 31.8 people per hectare estimated for the Tairona period, but the tight clustering and artifact densities suggest that at its peak the village population was between 100 and 160 inhabitants. If we add in the outlying residential clusters, the population might have feasibly reached 180 to 200 inhabitants. In comparison to the population figures estimated for Pueblito during the Tairona period, the demographic difference is profound and shows a dramatic increase in population." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_50_CoTairo]It seems that between 1100 and abandonment in the 16th century there was substantial population growth, so it is not possible to assess the population between 1100 and 1350 CE.At 1200 and 1300 CE: the population number has been given a range between the range for 1100CE and that for 1500 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Fast forward next to 1975. Archaeologists Luisa Fernanda Herrera and Gilberto Cadavid have almost completed a large survey of the northern and western sides of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, locating and documenting two hundred and eleven sites with similar characteristics, ranging from a few terraces and circular buildings, stone paths and stairways to very large towns like Pueblito surpassing one hundred hectares. Site 200 found in this survey, or Buritaca 200, as it was then called, is Ciudad Perdida, the “Lost City”, comprising more than 30 hectares of stone masonry terracing, circular and oblong buildings, stairways, and flag-stoned paths and sidewalks." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_51_CoTairo]Pueblito was probably bigger than Ciudad Perdida for the NGA area, even though Ciudad Perdida was the biggest settlement in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"In a town such as Ciudad Perdida that by A.D. 1500 would have had 2500 to 3000 inhabitants, everyone would have been on view to everyone all the time as they moved about or worked in the open spaces and patios." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_52_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta: "The largest of the sites is Ciudad Perdida, built between 1,100-1,200 masl. The temperature is stable year-round with minor fluctuations between a maximum of 26 C during the day and a minimum of 16.5 C at night. The annual precipitation is approximately 4,000 mm. This carefully planned “city” is strategically located to dominate the Buritaca River Valley (for a discussion on Tairona urbanism see Aprile-Gniset 1991: 33-113). It has 120 residential terraces, each with one or more circular house platforms of fine stone masonry where a large circular building formerly stood. These terraces are interconnected by a complex web of flagstone stairs and pathways (Figure 22.14). Everything is linked by a simple systems of water drainage with channels designed to control water force as it ran down the steep slopes. Water runs slowly along the stone walls next to stairs and pathways to end in streams that dissect the site. In this way the Tairona controlled erosion, one of the major problems typically arising in steeply inclined environments (Serje de la Ossa 1984). If we suppose that a terrace (Figure 22.14b) represents one family unit, in contrast to the traditional western assumption that each circular house platform equals a family unit, then we can estimate that this site probably had a population of between 400-600 persons living in an area of 18 ha." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_53_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The lower portions of the Sierra Nevada, 360-500 m (1,181-1,650 ft) above sea level, were first occupied in the sixth and seventh centuries and the higher zones several centuries later. One of the largest of these late settlements is the site Ciudad Perdida (figure 10.18) Ciudad Perdida—also known as Teyuna and Buritaca 200—is a large set of terraces, circular dwellings, tombs, and plazas built on a web of ridges above the Rio Buritaca. The site covers about 30 ha (74 acres) and was discovered by looters in the mid-1970s. With more than 100 residential terraces, population may have been 2,000-8,000 people." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_54_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"By the 16th century, we estimate that Teyuna might have had a population between fifteen hundred and two thousand people. If we add to this the popula- tion estimates for the surrounding settlements, approximately ten thousand people were living in this area alone at this time. Bear in mind that these are very conservative estimates, since precise demographics for pre-Hispanic populations are incredibly difficult to calculate."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_56_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Spanish informants describe a densely populated area with towns and settlements of all sizes, from pueblos of 20, 40, or 80 houses to large towns with 400 to 1,000 structures that included ceremonial houses and temples. These figures fit well with the archaeological evidence from coastal and from highland regions for the existence of a three-level hierarchy of sites (Serje 1987; Oyuela Caycedo 1987b) in which the larger ones, such as Pueblito, have some 1,000 structures (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1954a: 161; 1954b; G. Reichel-Dolmatoff and A. Reichel-Dolmatoff 1955). Major towns, such as Bonda and Pocigueica, were governed by chiefs (caciques) and seem to have formed the nuclei of incipient states. " [MAJIDBENAM_REF_57_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Not surprisingly, prehispanic societies took advantage of this river and its resources, including the Muisca, Tierradentro, San Agustin/ Alto Magdalena, and Tairona chiefdoms of Colombia. In general, these chiefdoms exhibited two-tier settlement systems, composed of multiple primary centers with associated second-level communities." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_58_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"What is absent on the Alto Buritaca is a neat hierarchy of settlements, the pattern often used to identify the centralized organizations of chiefdoms. Oyuela-Caycedo has written, “Decentralized political complexes coordinated the whole commercial enterprise for one or more of the mountainous valleys, as indicated for Ciudad Perdida.” " [MAJIDBENAM_REF_59_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The only projects that contribute data about the distribution of settlements at the regional scale are those of Serje and Oyuela. The former attempts to differentiate among the types of Late Period settlements on the Buritaca Basin based on the number of dwelling platforms. Using such criteria, Serje (1987:90) identifies 'provincial capitals', like Buritaca 200 or Pueblito, with more than two hundred terraces; second order sites, with an average of eighty terraces; and peripheral sites, with fewer than fifty terraces. Based on that information a 'three-tiered settlement hierarchy' is proposed (Serje 1987:90). Oyuela (1995) also makes an attempt to evaluate the information about settlement patterns as they relate to models of social organization in Gaira and the Alto Buritaca Basin. Oyuela evaluated the presence of centralization in the settlements found in those two regions. Based on the rank-size method (Johnson 1981) he found a strongly convex distribution in both regions, thus proposing that the chiefdoms in the Sierra Nevada and the coastal plain did not constitute "centralized organizations" (Oyuela 1995:126)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_60_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Nevertheless, if the larger regional scale is considered, two or more clearly differentiated hierarchies may be identified. In fact, the studied area is very close to Pueblito (approximately 10km) where the Bonda settlement might belong, one of the places that the Spanish considered the seat of an important chiefdom (Figure1). Given that the most conservative estimate for Pueblito's area is 4km2, such a site would represent a higher level in the hierarchy." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_61_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Site size and complexity ranges from a few masonry terraces with domestic structures to very large towns with elaborate stone masonry terracing, flag-stoned paths and walk ways, public areas, and canals covering over one hundred and fifty hectares."

Los resultados muestran que el primer asentamiento no es muy diferente de los otros (todos los datos presentados en el gráfico están en m2) Sólo después del octavo asentamiento es que hay una caída en el tamaño de éstos. Hay tres clases de asentamientos: uno por encima de las 10 hectáreas, el segundo entre las 6 y 2 hectáreas y un último grupo de asentamientos pequeños por debajo de una hectárea." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_63_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Buritaca settlement hierarchy four levels: 8 ha, between 3 and 4 ha, between 1 and 3 ha, and below 1 ha; Oyuela-Caycedo also mentions the site of Buritaca 200 (Ciudad Perdida) at 20ha and Nulicuandecue at 13 ha. "En contraste, el gráfico del alto Buritaca muestra una distribución convexa más cercana a la normal logarítmica (Figura 6). El asentamiento de mayor rango es Buritaca 200 con 20 hectáreas, seguido por Nulicuandecue con 13 hectáreas. En este caso, la distribución parece estar más cerca a la esperada en un sistema integrado. Igualmente, en contraste con Gaira, hay tendencia hacia la centralización, pero ésta no es fuerte como para estar formando una distribución cóncava. Considerando la cercanía de Buritaca 200 y Nulicuandecue (un día de camino), es probable que existiese algún tipo de competencia entre estos dos asentamientos. En cuanto a los tipos de asentamientos, una tipología de éstos basada de manera principal en atributos cualitativos fue previamente desarrollada. En comparación, se pueden definir cuatro clases de asentamientos: uno con asentamientos por encima de ocho hectáreas y compuesto por cuatro asentamientos que son los más monumentales; una suave caída en el gráfico separa otro grupo de asentamientos con tamaños entre cuatro y tres hectáreas, y un tercer grupo compuesto por pequeñas aldeas con tamaños entre una y tres hectáreas.

The third type are the secondary centres, which have a civic-ceremonial centre with megalithic structures (there are no sectors in the residential terraces). The last type of settlement consists in primary regional centres, of which two are known, Pueblito and Ciudad Perdida. These are characterised by their central ceremonial-civic zone, and more than 150 residential terraces grouped in sectors. Given their strategic location, it is possible that their function was to distribute and exchange products within the region, as in the well-studied cases of Formative Mesoamerica. "En el período clásico se distinguen por lo menos cuatro tipos de asentamientos como son: sitios de habitación temporal, sin ningún vestigio megalítico, tal vez campamentos ocasionales de pesca o de obtención de sal. Aldeas que en algunas ocasiones presentan infraestructura megalítica en el sector central. El tercer tipo son los centros secundarios de regular tamaño que presentan un sector central cívico ceremonial con estructuras megalíticas (no se observan sectorizaciones entre las terrazas de vivienda). El último tipo de asentamiento lo constituyen los centros primarios regionales, de los cuales se conocen dos, que son Pueblito y Ciudad Perdida. Estos se caracterizan por constar de una zona central de carácter cívico ceremonial y más de ciento cincuenta terrazas de vivienda agrupadas en sectores. Dada su situación estratégica, es probable que la función de esos asentamientos fuera la distribución y el intercambio de productos dentro de la región, de manera análoga a los bien estudiados casos de Mesoamérica durante el formativo."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_66_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Whatever the truth, Spanish sources suggest that the Tairona had a hierarchy of office- holders. Oviedo notes that the ruler of Bonda was “the Lord of all the caciques of that province” (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1953: 88), and for the Valle de la Caldera Father Pedro Simón wrote in 1628, “The towns [pueblos] would be about two hundred and fifty, and most of them obey a cacique called Guacanaoma, though there is not a single town that does not have its own Cacique or Mohan” (Simón 1882-92, 5: 192). Mohanes were native priests, and the significance of the naoma element in the cacique’s name is examined below. There is one possible mention of a female ruler, “a caciqua or principal woman among them” (Reichel- Dolmatoff 1951: 10), though the text is unclear about whether she was a ruler in her own right or simply a woman of high status, perhaps the wife of a chief. Some towns were divided into barrios, each of which had its subsidiary cacique (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1951: 88). Besides caciques, Spanish sources mention capitanes, principales (nobles), mandadores (commanders), and capitanes de guerra. Fray Pedro Simón (1882-92, 5: 197) also lists a pregonero (speaker or crier) who was second only to the chief. Spanish accounts do not list the duties and powers of all these officials, but it seems clear that there was a hierarchy of civil and military office- holders." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_67_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The mohanes are undoubtedly priests (see Castellanos 1955, 2: 596), but the status of the naomas is less clear. Juan de Castellanos, writing in 1601, notes that naomas could hold political office and that they outranked ordinary caciques: “fifteen caciques, great señores, are subject to the command of the naoma called, it is said, Marocando” (Castellanos 1955, 2: 340). The same author also mentions a personage called Betoma, “whom they rec- ognized as a Naoma and who held command over all the caciques” (ibid.: 548). The political power of sixteenth-century naomas is not in doubt, but their priestly role remains ambiguous." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_68_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"We know that by the 16th century some leaders extended their political domain over other towns and lower ranking leaders, controlling great territories or “provinces”, as they were called by the Spanish. It is also true that no single leader exerted control over all the population and territory. This supposes a complicated sociopolitical arrangement, wherein different leaders probably competed with each other to extend their influence by way of alliances, trade partnerships and occasional skirmishes, so that their political power and authority increased or diminished accordingly."

Even though the priests had influence and participation in the consensus, they were not embellished in royal management power, on the other hand, the chiefs were called to the managing and justice, and did not had any religious implication. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_71_CoTairo]"The chronicles make frequent reference to naomas and mohanes, of whom there could be several in each town. The two words are often used interchangeably, and these people are usually considered to be priests and ritual specialists,the possible ancestors of the present-day Kogi and Ika mamas (Dussán de Reichel 2000: 88; for a contrary view see Bischof 1971; 1982-83: 88). In this connection, there is an interesting mention in the Relación de Tayrona (1571) to a town with two caciques; the principal one was called Mamanauma (Oyuela- Caycedo 1998: 52). The mohanes are undoubtedly priests (see Castellanos 1955, 2: 596), but the status of the naomas is less clear. Juan de Castellanos, writing in 1601, notes that naomas could hold political office and that they outranked ordinary caciques: “fifteen caciques, great señores, are subject to the command of the naoma called, it is said, Marocando” (Castellanos 1955, 2: 340). The same author also mentions a personage called Betoma, “whom they recognized as a Naoma and who held command over all the caciques” (ibid.: 548).

During this trip, the process of the accession of a priest was described: "They obeyed an Indian called mohán who cured them of sickness.

According to a few references from the 16th century, it was a great village to which the mountain people descended to obtain salt and fish, bringing cloths and gold. Ciénaga was a meeting point for the Mompox indigenous populations and 'others which lived on the shores of the Magdalena', who met in order to obtain salt. Thanks to its strategic location close to the sea, the marshes and the mountains, and easy access to the interior plains, Ciénaga acted like an enclave of prehispanic trade between 'Tairona' societies and the populations of the Lower Magdalena and the plains of the River Cesar, enabling products from the Sierra to reach further territories via intermediaries.  "Sabemos, efectivamente, que a la llegada de los españoles Ciénaga era un mercado importante al cual acudían los indígenas de las montañas (en Friede, 1975. 1:212). Según algunas referencias del siglo XVI se trataba de "un gran pueblo, donde abajan los indios de la Sierra a rescatar pescado y sal, y traénles oro y mantas" (en Friede, 1960: 2141; de otro lado, aún en 1787. Ciénaga constituía un punto de encuentro para los indígenas de Mompox y de "otros que habitan en una y otra orilla del Magdalena" que se reunian con el fin de conseguir sal (Julíán, 1980: 110). Por su posición estratégica, cerca al mar, a las ciénagas, a la Sierra, y con fácil acceso a las llanuras del interior, Ciénaga actuaba como un enclave de comercio prebispánico entre las sociedades "tairona" y los pobladores del bajo Magdalena y Uanuras del Cesar, brindando la posibilidad de que, a través de intermediarios, los productos producidos en la Sierra Uegaran a territorios bien alejados."

This arts and crafts specialization, coupled with intensive exchange of agricultural products, was possible because of the regional ecological diversity found in the SNSM. The diversity encouraged the development of centers of specialization and regions of production for items such as ceramics, lithic artifacts, and agricultural products. At last archaeologists are beginning to understand the ancient system as they reconstruct the web of roads and pathways that connected all of the sites (Oyuela-Caycedo 1987a, 1990; Herrera de Turbay 1985; Kurela 1993; Herrera 2000)."
