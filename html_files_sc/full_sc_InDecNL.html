They could be ordered into a hierarchy in terms of size, but, considering the widespread evidence for egalitarianism at the time [MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_InDecNL], perhaps it would be wrong to describe the relationship between differently-sized sites as "hierarchy"?[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The archaeological record of the Neolithic Period (2700-1200 BC) in northern Karnataka and western Andhra Pradesh documents a regional social landscape of small village communities where relatively egalitarian social relations appear to have been a common practice. Neolithic settlements consisted of small circular wattle-and-daub houses grouped together in villages and camps, in some cases together with stock enclosures, communal butchering, and tool-making areas (Fuller et al., 2007; Paddayya, 1998, 2001). Where adequately documented, settlements contain houses with little variation in size, design, or content. The only significant dimension of variability observed in mortuary practices is that between adult and subadult burials (and perhaps in more limited terms sex), suggesting that the transition to adulthood was an important measure of difference and likely rank within Neolithic society (Bauer et al., 2007). Other than this, there is no evidence for Neolithic social differences or ranking in the archaeological record."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_InDecNL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/><b>♠ Administrative levels ♣ ♥</b> levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Beyond differences in mortuary treatment between adults and sub-adults, "there is no evidence for Neolithic social differences or ranking in the archaeological record" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_InDecNL].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious levels ♣ ♥</b> levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Beyond differences in mortuary treatment between adults and sub-adults, "there is no evidence for Neolithic social differences or ranking in the archaeological record" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_InDecNL].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]However, there were communal rituals. Presumably these rituals were lead by an individual, e.g. an elder.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Ashmounds marked the locations of important Neolithic places (e.g. settlements and camps) as well as commemorating and memorializing communal ritual; their permanence and scale further suggest that these highly visible structures were intended to mark the landscape for generations (Allchin, 1963; Boivin, 2004; Johansen, 2004; Paddayya, 2001). The centrality and high visibility of many ashmounds within Neolithic settlements and camps suggests that the ritual practices that created these features were open, public, and socially integrative, transmitting socio-symbolically charged information concerning community integration and social reproduction (Boivin, 2004; Johansen, 2004). The repetitive ritual practices that created these monuments employed a valued and almost certainly sacralized substance (dung) collected from an animal with profound symbolic, economic, and political importance to Neolithic agro-pastoral communities. Ashmound ritual also appears to have produced very specific sets of social claims to places such as seasonal and permanent settlements, adjacent pasturage, water sources, and critically to community cattle herds whose daily movements and seasonal transhumance navigated established and contested spaces within a dynamic Neolithic social landscape. In doing so, ashmound production clearly and legibly socialized places, materializing social relations at community and regional scales of practice. Ashmound production was, then, both ritual and political activity, affirming and reinforcing social relationships by inscribing them in monumental places with a highly visible and legible political materiality within the Neolithic landscape."</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Military levels ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Beyond differences in mortuary treatment between adults and sub-adults, "there is no evidence for Neolithic social differences or ranking in the archaeological record" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_InDecNL].</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Professions">Professions</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional military officers ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Full-time specialists</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional soldiers ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Full-time specialists</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional priesthood ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Full-time specialists</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bureaucracy_characteristics">Bureaucracy characteristics</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Full-time bureaucrats ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> Full-time specialists</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Examination system ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Merit promotion ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Specialized government buildings ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Law">Law</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Formal legal code ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Judges ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Courts ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional Lawyers ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Specialized_Buildings:_polity_owned">Specialized Buildings: polity owned</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ irrigation systems ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ drinking water supply systems ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ markets ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ food storage sites ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Transport_infrastructure">Transport infrastructure</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Roads ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Bridges ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Canals ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ports ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Special_purpose_sites">Special purpose sites</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Mines or quarries ♣ present ♥</b> "Dolerite trap dykes were quarried for the production of groundstone axes and other tools" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_InDecNL].</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Information">Information</span></h3><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Writing_System">Writing System</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Mnemonic devices ♣ ♥</b> unknown</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Nonwritten records ♣ ♥</b> unknown</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Written records ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Script ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Non-phonetic writing ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Phonetic alphabetic writing ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Kinds_of_Written_Documents">Kinds of Written Documents</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Lists, tables, and classifications ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Calendar ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Sacred Texts ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious literature ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Practical literature ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ History ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Philosophy ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Scientific literature ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Fiction ♣ inferred absent ♥</b><br/></div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Money">Money</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Articles ♣ inferred present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Tokens ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Precious metals ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Foreign coins ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Indigenous coins ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Paper currency ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Postal_System">Postal System</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Couriers ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Postal stations ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ General postal service ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div></body></html>
