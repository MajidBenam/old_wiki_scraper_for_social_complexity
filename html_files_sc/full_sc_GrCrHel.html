[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_GrCrHel] The settlement hierarchy within city-states is centered upon the city where all the government, public and religious buildings were located, and villages and hamlets scatted throughout its rural countryside. State-confederations, located mostly on mountainous regions, are formed by villages and hamlets centered upon an important regional sanctuary. Knossos, Gortyna, and Kydonia were cited by Strabo as the most powerful city-states. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_GrCrHel] Between 260-240 BCE the power of Knossos seems to have been dominant. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_GrCrHel] Knossos and Gortyn were the principal political centers of the island until the Roman conquest.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Administrative levels ♣5♥</b> levels.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_GrCrHel] Cretan soldiers were remarkably well-trained in ambushes, raids, surprise attacks and nigh fighting.  The difficult economic conditions forced many young men to found employment as mercenaries in foreign armies especially during the Hellenistic period. They were exclusively citizens who could provide their own arms.  Recruiting campaigns organized by the foreign states were regularly conducted in the Cretan cities. Negotiations had to be managed by the governments of the city-states. Cretan mercenaries were hired in the armies of Egypt, Syria, Sparta, the Achaen League, Pergamon,  Macedonia, Syracuse and Rome. The number of hired mercenaries sometimes was very high; Perseus forces, for instance, during the Third Macedonia War (171 BCE) included 3,000 Cretans. Apart from the economic benefits, Cretan mercenaries brought new ideas that changed the conservative communities of the Cretan cities considerably.  Cretans were also widely recognized as the best archers. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_GrCrHel] According to the tradition, it was Apollo who taught archery to Cretans. Diodorus Siculus in his Bibliotheca Historica said that  "as the discoverer of the bow he [Apollo] taught the people of the land all about the use of the bow, this being the reason why the art of archery is especially cultivated by the Cretans and the bow is called 'Cretan'. " [MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_GrCrHel] They fight exclusively for the profit. A Cretan archer said to Julius Caesar "Profit is our target, and every one of our arrows is short for money, both on land and sea."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_42_GrCrHel]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Indigenous coins ♣ present ♥</b> During the Hellenistic period, most Cretan cities started their coinage. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_43_GrCrHel] The outburst of coining has been explained as the result of returning mercenaries, commerce, or difficult political situation in the Aegean.  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_44_GrCrHel]  According the Stefanakis the outburst of coining indicates the change in the economic mentality of Cretans. Mercenaries and merchants who had become accustomed to money transactions while abroad might have contributed to the adoption of coinage in their home cities. Moreover, the high influx of foreign silver coins in the state treasuries led to the active participation in the monetary economy. "However, because transactions on foreign currency of different weight standards would have been difficult since an established weight standard had existed on Crete for over a century and a half, the cities found it necessary tp reming the silver in their possessions and therefore to developed their own mints and choose their own coin types." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_45_GrCrHel] Cretan city-states adopted a reduced Aiginetan standard which fluctuated between 6% and 12% below the Aiginetan standard of 12.20 gr. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_46_GrCrHel] The Cretan mints, therefore, were adjusting to a weight standard that dominated the southeastern Aegean. It is also likely that the adoption of  a standard lower than that of the Aeginetan was due to the the scarcity of silver on the island. The standard weights of the Cretan coins are ±11.10 for stater, ±5.50 for drachm, ±2.75 for hemidrachm, and ±0.90 for obol.</div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Postal_System">Postal System</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Couriers ♣ absent♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Postal stations ♣absent♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ General postal service ♣ absent♥</b></div></body></html>
