During the Terminal Formative (c.200-1 BC), MxFormT includes at least parts of the regions of Cuauhtitlan, Texcoco, Ixtapalapa, and Chalco. The territory of Cuicuilco and Teotihuacan hegemony is very poorly understood during the Terminal Formative, and it is possible that the entire Basin of Mexico was controlled by the two polities at this time. Prominent excavated sites of the MxFormT quasi-polity include Tlapacoya, Temamatla, Torremote-Tlaltenco, Loma Torremote, Cuanalan, and Tezoyuca.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> people.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ 20,000: 100-1 BCE; [40,000-60,000]: 0-99 CE ♥</b> Inhabitants. "It has been difficult to get people to recognize that the Patlachique phase (c.100-1 BCE) was more than a prelude to the development of Teotihuacan [...] By the end of this phase, the population was likely at least 20,000".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_MxFormT] During the next stage (Tzacualliphase: AD1-150), Teotihuacan quickly became the largest and most populous metropolis in the New World. By AD 150 the urban area had expanded to approximately 20 km2 and contained some 60,000 to 80,000 inhabitants.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_MxFormT]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hierarchical_Complexity">Hierarchical Complexity</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ [3-4] ♥</b> levels.

Political and religious institutions are thought to be essentially identical for the Central Mexican Highlands Late/Terminal Formative, such that political power was inherently theocratic.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_MxFormT] At least 3 hierarchical levels of religious institutions can be discerned for Cuicuilco. First, formal religious ritual at the household/house-group level (i.e. local corporate/Kin groups, the the basal units of exchange and production) is ubiquitous for the Central Mexican Highlands Late/Terminal Formative, and these are thought to have organized the basal level of the political economy. This has been inferred from the ubiquitous household/house-group shrines and ritual offerings, which are associated with senior lineage houses in house compounds. Compared to junior lineage houses, senior lineage houses also have higher quantities of prestige goods, food storage, obsidian/lithic production, burials, larger houses/rooms, greater architectural quality and ornamentation, and greater occupational time depth. Given that these same ritual tropes are replicated at higher hierarchical levels, it has been inferred that senior lineage religious-ritual authority in access to ancestors was the basis of political-economic authority at the basal house-group (kin/corporate group) level.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_42_MxFormT] Second, formal settlement- or community-level religious rituals (i.e. wider groupings of hierarchically-ordered kin/corporate-groups) were associated with feasting sponsored by religious/political elites, ritual labor service (production/construction), and sacrificial offerings. Evidence for these religious institutions are centered on settlements' ceremonial precincts (temples and plazas), which directly associate them with the priestly elite and the political economy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_43_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_44_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_45_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_46_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_47_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_48_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_49_MxFormT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_50_MxFormT]
