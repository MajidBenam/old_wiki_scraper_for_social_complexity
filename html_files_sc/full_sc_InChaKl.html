"The next fifteen hundred years consolidated without significantly altering this pattern."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_InChaKl] McEvedy and Jones estimated for Pakistan, India and Bangladesh 77m for 1000 CE, 80m for 1100 CE. If the proportion within the Ganges basin remained the same (40%) that leaves for the rest of the Indian Subcontinent: 46.2m for 1000 CE, 48 for 1100 CE. Pakistan contains the Indus valley which presumably also was densely populated.  If we assume the fertile Indus valley contained the majority (50% population?) of the remaining population, whilst respecting the claim that "the demographic centre of the country" was the Gangetic provinces (so Indus probably does not hold much more than 50% of the non-Gangetic population) that leaves for the remaining areas: 23.1m for 1000 CE, 24m for 1100 CE. The remaining area left covers 2,000,000 km2 and the polity of about 650,000 KM2 covered about 33% of this area. So, assuming an even distribution of population across the remaining landmass, a population magnitude estimate would be: 7.6m for 1000 CE, 7.9m for 1100 CE. According to maps of 800-900 CE[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_InChaKl] there were about 6-7 other polities in the remaining region during the same time period.</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ [50,000-125,000] ♥</b> Inhabitants.

However, several sources allude to the importance, at least for some branches of the religion, of the relationship between student and teacher or guru (e.g. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_InChaKl]), which suggests that perhaps it would not be entirely inappropriate to say that there is indeed a Hindu religious hierarchy, and that it is composed of two levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]_Jainism_[MAJIDBENAM_BR]NOTE: I have found two equally authoritative sources on Jain hierarchy:[MAJIDBENAM_BR](1) [MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_InChaKl][MAJIDBENAM_BR]1. <i>Arihants</i> (ones who have conquered their inner enemies)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]2. <i>Siddhas</i> (Liberated Ones)<div>3. <i>Acharyas</i> (who head the Order)<div>4. <i>Upadhyays</i> (who teach the message)<div>5. <i>Sadhus</i> (Monks/Seekers)</div></div></div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/>(2) [MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_InChaKl][MAJIDBENAM_BR]1.
