In the absence of a more accurate polity population estimate, the lower population estimate of 8,000-10,000 people given by Flannery and Marcus[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_MxAlb1E] is used as a very rough proxy for the Monte Albán polity population. 8,000-15,000: There is a large range of population estimates for the valley during this period, from roughly 8,000 to 15,000.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_MxAlb1E][MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_MxAlb1E][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Estimate for Monte Alban Early I sites in Valley of Oaxaca subareas[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Table 3.5.

Monte Albán was the largest settlement in the Valley of Oaxaca during this period, although it was founded in a previously unoccupied location. The settlement began with around 2,000 people[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_MxAlb1E], and increased to over 5,000 towards the end of this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_MxAlb1E] 5,000:  "From the area of the distribution of Early I sherds (and estimating a population of about 25-50 persons per hectare, less for the area of more scattered pottery), we estimate a population for Early I of 3,500-7,000 (Blanton 1978:33-35) and take the middle value of about 5,000 as the best estimate of population for the period.

There are different opinions as to how many levels of settlement hierarchy there were during this period. Much of the population of the valley moved to the newly founded settlement Monte Albán, which left sites such as San José Mogote abandoned.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_MxAlb1E] Monte Albán became the largest settlement by far (324ha in size towards the end of this period), but there were two other main settlements in the other arms of the valley (Yegüih and San Martin Tilcajete, the latter covering 52.8ha by the end of this period)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_MxAlb1E]. If these settlements are excluded (as they were the primary centres of different polities), then the remaining settlements in the Central and Etla valley areas may either form one or two levels, depending on the classification.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_MxAlb1E][MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_MxAlb1E] Yegüih (in Tlacolula subregion) and San Mart´ın Tilcajete (in Ocotl´an-Zimatl´an subregion) were primary centres in the other arms of the valley, with two further levels of settlement hierarchy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_MxAlb1E].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1.

There may also have been tertiary centres, if the smaller villages and hamlets are included.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_46_MxAlb1E] The administrative levels have been coded as equivalent to the settlement hierarchy as there is little additional evidence for internal administration.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1.

This evidence includes the specialisation of ceramic production by different communities (such as those seen in different assemblages at Monte Albán)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_68_MxAlb1E], and the absence of evidence for state storage facilities, “a prominent byproduct of the redistributive economies, suggests the presence of a different mode of exchange.”.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_69_MxAlb1E] We asked Gary Feinman[MAJIDBENAM_REF_70_MxAlb1E] and he said: "Markets clearly have a long history in Mesoamerica before Aztec times. Back in the 1980s, I wrote a paper with Blanton and Kowalewski arguing that there were markets in Monte Albán I (ca. 500-200 BC). You can also find that argument in Ancient Mesoamerica and Ancient Oaxaca.

There are definite roads/accessways within sites. Blanton defines some at Monte Albán and Linda [Nicholas] and I defined some at El Palmillo. These likely were not paved, but they may have been banked and were cleared. Between sites there are known 16th century trails, which were likely used for a long, long time.
