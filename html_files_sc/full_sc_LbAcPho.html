Unfortunately, due to the difficulties in excavating the Phoenician cities, there appear to be no good estimates for the populations for each polity. Markoe (2000:196) tentatively suggests that by the 4th Century BCE, Tyre's population "may have reached forty thousand, if one accepts Arrian's testimony concerning the number of soldiers slain and inhabitants sold into slavery at the time of Alexander's siege." Diodorus reported that over 40,000 people in Sidon were killed when Artaxerxes III captured the city in 351 BCE, with an unspecified number of survivors sold into slavery. Yet enough people remained for Sidon to recover as a thriving metropolis within only a few years.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_LbAcPho] One might suppose that at least ten thousand Sidonians remained after Artaxerxes' depredations. Tyre and Sidon were, of course, the leading cities of Phoenicia, giving us little to work with when estimating the size of the other cities. Arwad, in the second rank of Phoenician polities, was on an island of some 40 hectares; according to the "conventional" (and questionable) rule of thumb of 250 inhabitants per built-up hectare,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_LbAcPho] this would indicate some 10,000 inhabitants. However, classical sources indicate that the island was densely populated, with strong fortifications and an urban core with multi-story buildings.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_LbAcPho] We can likely double the initial estimate, in my view.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ [40,000-60,000] ♥</b> Inhabitants.

Partecipa a modo suo, pur non essendo divinizzato, a entrambe le condizioni: umano e divino, svolge nelle pratiche rituali un ruolo di spicco, come sacerdote della divinta’ poliade, as esempio di Astarte a Sidone o della Baalat Gubal a Biblo.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_LbAcPho] TRANSLATION: “The ruler occupied a strategic intermediary position between the divine sphere and the human. Though he was not himself a god, he did in his own way partake of both spheres: human and god-like, the ruler played a prominent role in ritual, and was seen as the chief priest in charge of his city’s patron deity, such as Astarte in Sidonia and Baalat Gubal in Biblos.” "Gli uffici del culto regolare, invece, erano affidati a un apposito personale, che le iscrizioni ci mostrano strutturato gerarchicamente e articolato in vari livello di ministero. Nei vari culti il clero era guidato da un sommo sacerdote e comprendeva, oltre agli altri sacerdoti e alle sacerdotesse, una schiera numerosa di personale minore, dai macellatori ai profumieri, dagli scribi agli schiavi. [...] Due cariche sembrano di particolare importanza: quella del 'sacrificatore', probabilmente scelto con incarico pubblico e rinnovabile, dai compiti forse analoghi al ruolo del <i>mageiros</i> nella religione greca; e quella, meno chiara, del <i>mqmlm</i>, forse il sacredote 'risuscitatore della divinita', frequente nelle inscrizioni di Cartagine, Cipro, Rodi, Tripolitania.
