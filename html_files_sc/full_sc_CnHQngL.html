Miao settlements are found anywhere from a few hundred meters above sea level to elevations of 1,400 meters or more. The largest number are uplands people, often living at elevations over 1,200 meters and located at some distance from urban centers or the lowlands and river valleys where the Han are concentrated. Often, these upland villages and hamlets are interspersed with those of other minorities such as Yao, Dong, Zhuang, Yi, Hui, and Bouyei.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_CnHQngL] 'The Ch'uan Miao are an ethnic group living on the borders of Szechwan, Kweichow, and Yunnan Provinces, western China. The country is very mountainous with numerous peaks rising 3,000 to 6,000 feet above sea level. There are many streams, forests, waterfalls, perpendicular or overhanging cliffs, natural caves and natural bridges, and deepholes or pits where the water disappears into the bowels of the earth. While the roads between the Chinese towns and villages are generally paved with stones, most of the roads are narrow footpaths up and down the steep mountainsides or through fields and forests.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_CnHQngL] Some authors claim periodic decreases in population size for the rural Hmong population and report inconsistencies in the self-reporting of settled territory: 'The area of the Sheng Miao according to their exaggerated account, extends to 9,000 li, but actually the area is about 200 /sq./ li in length and width. It is a mountainous area, the highest peak at Teng-k'ung-ming-t'ang being 2,000 meters, and the total population about 10,000. The writer has visited altogether 101 Sheng Miao villages of all sizes, the largest being Chia-lu, Chia-mien, Chia-ya, Chia-lung, Chia-wêng, Cheng-yu, Tang-wêng and Chüeh-ts'ai-p'ing, with about 100 families in each.  Even today they do not have a single market fair within the area and this shows how circumscribed is the sphere of their economic activity. Their only means of livelihood is agriculture. Almost all the fields are terraced according to natural topography, rising from the bottom of the slope to the top in several hundred layers. The shape of the field is long and narrow, producing rice, wheat, corn and barley. [...] Being in direct contact with them, the writer could watch at close quarters their extremely miserable conditions, which are pitiable indeed. Because of their ignorance they do not know how to save or to improve the method of production. In case of famine they cannot escape starvation,  which is the most important reason for the decrease in their population.'

The main social organization structure in traditional Hmong society is the clan (Xeem) system, followed by a clan’s many lineages, and then the families within those lineages. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_CnHQngL] The Qing allowed the traditional village and lineage headmen of Hmong and other groups in the Yunnan, Guizhou and Sichuan to act as local officials of the empire, preserving some degree of traditional culture and social structure. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_CnHQngL] In the seventeenth century, the early Qing rulers wanted to bring the land of the Hmong Frontier within reach. The native tusi alliance was partially abolished and the territory incorporated as the southwestern tip of Chenzhou Prefecture; by 1730 the program included “bringing chieftains into the system” (gaitu guiliu). The Hmong Frontier’s remaining native units were dismantled; the Qing retained aspects of the former chieftain system in the establishment of a new set of hereditary leaders known as “Hundred-household Heads” (baihu).

Agricultural technologies and practices varied depending on the prevalence of dry swidden versus wet rice cultivation: 'Economic strategies vary. The Hua Miao were shifting-swidden agriculturalists, growing buckwheat, oats, corn, potatoes, and hemp, and using a simple wooden hand plow or hoe. Sheep and goats were fed on nearby pasture land. Additionally the Hua Miao hunted with crossbow and poisoned arrows and gathered foodstuffs in the forests. In parts of Guizhou, the Miao more closely resembled their Han neighbors in their economic strategies as well as in their technology (the bullock-drawn plow, harrowing, use of animal and human wastes as fertilizer). The Cowrie Shell Miao in central Guizhou were settled farmers growing rice in flooded fields, and also raising millet, wheat, beans, vegetables, and tobacco. Their livestock was limited to barnyard pigs and poultry, with hunting and gathering playing a very minor role. Some of the Black Miao in southeast Guizhou combine intensive irrigated terrace farming of rice with dry-field upland cropping.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_CnHQngL] Many Hmong groups practice wet rice terrace irrigation and used the horse-driven wooden water-wheel. Others were swidden agriculturalists who did not have irrigation.

Only some villages benefited from pipe construction schemes by missionaries, and this process did not start until the late 19th and early 20th centuries: 'The mountain community of Shimenkan (Stone Gateway) in northwestern Guizhou served as the headquarters of church activity. In addition to its own large primary school, it offered secondary schooling and teacher training. At least thirty Hua Miao continued on and graduated from university in the decades before 1949. Some of these became ordained Methodist ministers or doctors and one became a well-regarded anthropologist (Yang Hanxian). Generally the local chapels were served by lay preachers who were trained at Shimenkan. Other young people received training as nurses and agricultural extension workers. At various points in time, agricultural and industrial extension programs were held at Shimenkan. New strains of potatoes were introduced, fruit orchards were planted on the hillsides of many villages, vegetable gardens were encouraged, and a number of Miao learned the techniques of carpentry, brickmaking, and masonry. More efficient looms were designed for home production of cloth. During the prerevolutionary decades, some villages benefited from collective endeavors to build bridges and roads, and pipe systems that brought water into the community. Teams of medical workers, from Shimenkan or from the churchaffiliated hospitals in nearby Zhaotong City, traveled around the area periodically. Even those who were not interested in becoming church members participated in the economic innovations, accepted treatment from the medical workers, and sent their children to the schools.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_CnHQngL] Accordingly, we have assumed that most Hmong communities did not rely on drinking water supply systems, especially not before the Republican period.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ markets ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ food storage sites ♣ ♥</b></div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Transport_infrastructure">Transport infrastructure</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Roads ♣ present ♥</b> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_CnHQngL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Bridges ♣ inferred present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Canals ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ports ♣ ♥</b></div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Special_purpose_sites">Special purpose sites</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Mines or quarries ♣  ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Information">Information</span></h3><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Writing_System">Writing System</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Mnemonic devices ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Nonwritten records ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Written records ♣ absent ♥</b> The A-Hmao language was first written by the Pollard script in apprx. 1905.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_CnHQngL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Script ♣ absent ♥</b> The A-Hmao language was first written by the Pollard script in apprx. 1905.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_CnHQngL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_CnHQngL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Phonetic alphabetic writing ♣ absent ♥</b> The A-Hmao language was first written by the Pollard script in apprx. 1905.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_CnHQngL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_CnHQngL]</div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Kinds_of_Written_Documents">Kinds of Written Documents</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Lists, tables, and classifications ♣ absent ♥</b> The A-Hmao language was first written by the Pollard script in apprx. 1905.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_CnHQngL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Calendar ♣ absent ♥</b> 'On the eighth day of their fourth lunar month (around mid-May), the Miao celebrate a festival during which they offer sacrifices to their ancestors and cultural heroes.
