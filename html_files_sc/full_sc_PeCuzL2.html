[MAJIDBENAM_REF_57_PeCuzL2]"Before their removal by Huascar, the Pinahua controlled the area on the northern side of the Huatanay River east of the Angostura to its confluence with the Vilcanota River. There is no doubt that the Pinahua once occupied the large site of Choquepukio, since it is specifically and repeatedly mentioned as one of their former towns in the earlier documents of the suit." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_58_PeCuzL2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Using Google maps area calculator, and mapping the location of Tipón (known fortress against the Killke), Urcos (furthest point where Lucre ceramic appears), and Choquepukio itself, a conservative estimate would be 70 squared kilometers. However there is no reference to the polity territory in the literature and a settlement survey is lacking to ascertain the extent of the Lucre polity.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b>Cuzco: 15,000?[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Cuzco valley: 10,000-20,000. According to a Spanish source in mid 16th century, valley held over 20,000 [MAJIDBENAM_REF_59_PeCuzL2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"There were many other settlements in the Lucre area; some of them, such as Minaspata and Coto-coto, were almost as large as Choquepukio (Dwyer 1971: 41; Glowacki 2002: 271). Since those towns likely housed several thousand people each, the populace collectively posed an ongoing challenge to Inca hegemony. Sarmiento’s (2007: 87, 96, 99) informants said that four successive Inca rulers - from Inka Roca to Pachakuti - all took up arms against them, but only the last was able to finally subjugate and then disperse them. Because of the extended animosities, it is no surprise that the Oropesa area that lay between them was an unoccupied buffer zone for much of the early era (Bauer and Covey 2004: 84-7)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_60_PeCuzL2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The possibly allied site of Cotocotuyoc was 45 ha.

There was without doubt a state imperial economy that produced and moved large quantities of goods outside of any barter or other kind of market.

Some scholars think that the earliest systematic use of the khipu as a recording tool occurred in Wari or other expansionist states. It may owe its genesis to institutional demands, such as keeping track of supplies (Quilter and Urton 2002; Brokaw 2010). If they are right, then the Incas elaborated a package of administrative techniques developed by their imperial predecessors. It is certainly the case that the tool was well established across the Andes before the Inca empire came along, as different societies reportedly used a variety of knot-tying conventions. The chronicler Murua wrote that, “each province, as it had its own language, also had a different form and logic [razón] of quipo” (translation from Platt 2002: 229). In short, the Incas’ challenge most likely lay in systematizing recording for state institutions and in bringing many thousands of knot-masters up to speed in the preferred format, not in developing a specific inscription technique for state interests from scratch." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_98_PeCuzL2] However, Alan Covey, commenting on the lack of evidence for quipus among the Wari, told us that 'I would also not infer their [quipus'] use in the LIP (AD 1000-1400)'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_99_PeCuzL2] He seems to mean that we shouldn't automatically assume the Inca were using quipus before the period of imperial expansion began in earnest.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Script ♣ absent ♥</b> "There was no true writing system in the Andes prior to the arrival of the Spanish, notwithstanding recent interpretations of the quipu (see Quilter and Urton 2002) and the tocapu pictograms."
