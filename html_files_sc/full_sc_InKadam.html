However, several sources allude to the importance, at least for some branches of the religion, of the relationship between student and teacher or guru (e.g. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_InKadam]), which suggests that perhaps it would not be entirely inappropriate to say that there is indeed a Hindu religious hierarchy, and that it is composed of two levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]_Buddhism_[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Buddhist monastic communities replaced the caste system with one based on year of ordination. Previously ordained monks enjoyed rights and privileges higher in status than monks ordained later, and monks were categorically of higher status and privilege than nuns. In effect seniority and gender provided criteria for social status and increased access to 'pure' teachings and exemption from 'impure' duties."
