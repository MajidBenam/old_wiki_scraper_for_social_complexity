[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_ItLatCA] This is the earliest possible start date for professional soldiers.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional priesthood ♣ inferred absent ♥</b>  Professionalism of the priesthood likely pre-dates the Roman era as similar patterns are evident in Greek and Egyptian civilization. However, this period might be too early.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bureaucracy_characteristics">Bureaucracy characteristics</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Full-time bureaucrats ♣ absent ♥</b>There were likely no bureaucrats at all in this period.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Examination system ♣ absent ♥</b> There were likely no bureaucrats at all in this period.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Merit promotion ♣ absent ♥</b> There were likely no bureaucrats at all in this period.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Specialized government buildings ♣ absent ♥</b>  There were likely no government buildings in this period. The first senate building, the Curia Hostilia, existed from about 600 BCE. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_ItLatCA] The first paving of the Roman Forum occurred around 575-625 BCE. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_ItLatCA] The first coin minted in Rome occurred about 269 BCE (one in Neapolis produced coins slightly earlier, around 281 BCE) and the first state archives was created in 78 BCE. Other possible buildings include: granaries and storehouses.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Law">Law</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Formal legal code ♣ absent ♥</b> A formal legal code was first founded in the Twelve Tables of 450-449 BCE. Law thereafter was based on precedent. Our sources of knowledge of Roman law include the forensic speeches of Cicero; the Institutes of Gaius textbook (from 160 CE); and, much later, the sixth century CE Corpus Ius Civilis of Justinian. Wax tablets and papyri (contracts and wills etc.) also provide information on Roman law. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_ItLatCA] However, before this time restrictions on funerary extravagance, from the start of the 6th century, may suggest the Twelve Tables laws (of the Early Republic) codified an existing body of law and legal practices. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_ItLatCA] It is unlikely that any official legal code existed in Latium at the time of the Copper Age.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Judges ♣ absent ♥</b> Professional judges did not exist until the Roman Dominate although at that time their precise role vis-a-vis that of Imperial officials is a matter of debate. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_ItLatCA] Before this time there were no judges as a distinct profession in the Roman system of law. Local magistrates dealt with local matters, provincial governors dealt with provincial matters, and the praetors often dealt with cases in Rome. The Roman people could be duly convened as a final court of appeal in cases involving citizens.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Courts ♣ absent ♥</b> In Bronze Age Latium "Most settlements were simple collections of huts with no evidence for internal differentiation in architecture or material culture than might suggest clear-cut divisions in society." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_ItLatCA] The earlier Copper Age is not thought to have been more complex than this.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional Lawyers ♣ absent ♥</b> Law specialists first existed during the Principate when they commanded fees for their expertise. We know this because Emperor Claudius attempted to "limit the fees of advocates, which had become intolerably heavy" to protect "women and other helpless litigants from the rapacity of their lawyers." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_ItLatCA] The first law school in Rome, for persons who wished to pursue career in the Imperial civil service, was established late second century CE. "Professional" lawyers replaced orators during the Roman Dominate period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_ItLatCA]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Specialized_Buildings:_polity_owned">Specialized Buildings: polity owned</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ irrigation systems ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Possibly unnecessary within Italy at this time due to sufficient rainfall.

Earlier the old Forum Boarium and Forum Holitorium in the centre of Rome seem to have coped with the main flow of imports which had probably come down the Tiber from the Italian hills."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_ItLatCA] The first paved road was the probably the Appian Way which dates to 312 BCE. However, at this time the Via Salaria probably did not exist or if a track did exist it had no polity to provide maintenance on it.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Bridges ♣ absent ♥</b> The first bridge thought to be the Pons Sublicius possibly in built 642 BCE under Ancus Marcius.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Canals ♣ absent ♥</b> The first canal is thought to have been built by Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (consul 187 BCE) to drain the lower Po region.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ports ♣ absent ♥</b>  The Portus Tiberinus, a river harbour on the Tiber, was believed, in Roman times, to have been long inhabited [MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_ItLatCA] Other sources disagree between the earliest being from the Roman Kingdom under Ancus Marcius and Cosa, founded much later in 273 BCE "the earliest Roman port thus far known." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_ItLatCA] Since it is not clear from the Cornell quote which "Roman times" thought that the Portus Tiberinus had been long inhabited, and what "long inhabited" means in terms of dates, and whether that habitation was in the sense of a port rather than a small community which happened to be located where the port would later be, I have coded absent.</div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Special_purpose_sites">Special purpose sites</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Mines or quarries ♣ ♥</b> probably unknown</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Information">Information</span></h3><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Writing_System">Writing System</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Mnemonic devices ♣ ♥</b> probably unknown</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Nonwritten records ♣ inferred present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Written records ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Inferred from the fact that "most [Italian peoples before the Romans] were not even literate" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_ItLatCA], although some writing has been found in association with elite graves [MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_ItLatCA].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Script ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Inferred from the fact that "most [Italian peoples before the Romans] were not even literate" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_ItLatCA], although some writing has been found in association with elite graves [MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_ItLatCA]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Non-phonetic writing ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Inferred from the fact that "most [Italian peoples before the Romans] were not even literate" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_ItLatCA], although some writing has been found in association with elite graves [MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_ItLatCA]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Phonetic alphabetic writing ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Inferred from the fact that "most [Italian peoples before the Romans] were not even literate" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_ItLatCA], although some writing has been found in association with elite graves [MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_ItLatCA]</div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Kinds_of_Written_Documents">Kinds of Written Documents</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Lists, tables, and classifications ♣ absent ♥</b> Few, if any, people in Latium could read such things had they existed and they likely did not exist because there was no state bureaucracy or developed religion that would provide a reason to produce them.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Calendar ♣ absent ♥</b> First Roman calendar thought to be the 8th century BCE "Calendar of Romulus."</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Sacred Texts ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Inferred from the fact that "most [Italian peoples before the Romans] were not even literate" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_42_ItLatCA].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious literature ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Inferred from the fact that "most [Italian peoples before the Romans] were not even literate" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_43_ItLatCA].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Practical literature ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Inferred from the fact that "most [Italian peoples before the Romans] were not even literate" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_44_ItLatCA].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ History ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> "It is most improbable that the Italian peoples had any historical literature of their own (although the Etruscans are a possible exception)" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_45_ItLatCA].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Philosophy ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Inferred from the fact that "most [Italian peoples before the Romans] were not even literate" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_46_ItLatCA].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Scientific literature ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Inferred from the fact that "most [Italian peoples before the Romans] were not even literate" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_47_ItLatCA].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Fiction ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Inferred from the fact that "most [Italian peoples before the Romans] were not even literate" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_48_ItLatCA].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/></div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Money">Money</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Articles ♣ inferred present ♥</b> This is possible if there was a primitive economy.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Tokens ♣ absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Precious metals ♣ absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Foreign coins ♣ absent ♥</b> The first foreign Greek or Greek-influenced coinage arrived much later with the Etruscans (if considered "foreign") or Roman Kingdom.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Indigenous coins ♣ absent ♥</b> Rome produced its first coin about 281 BCE, a Greek-style silver didrachma, minted in Neapolis (and twelve years later coins were minted in Rome.)
