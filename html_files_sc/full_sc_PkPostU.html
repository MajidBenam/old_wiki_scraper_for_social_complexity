As far as the region is concerned, the mound of Pirak is the only one of its kind."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_PkPostU]. Although, the material culture found at Pirak has also been uncovered in a much wider area in the north of the Kachi Plain [MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_PkPostU], and as far as southern Central Asia and the Ganges valley.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_PkPostU] The population of Pirak has not been estimated.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_PkPostU][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hierarchical_Complexity">Hierarchical Complexity</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ [1-2] ♥</b> Inferred. Pirak is the best-preserved site in the Kachi Plain from this time. Although other sites such as Pathani Damb have also been found, it is difficult to estimate their extent due to the poor preservation of the site. “Although no systematic surveys have been carried out in the Kachi plain, it appears that this region lying between highland Baluchistan and the Indus valley was occupied without break by sizable settlements throughout the second and into the first millennium BC.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_PkPostU][MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_PkPostU][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/><b>♠ Administrative levels ♣ [0-2] ♥</b> The remains of terracotta and bronze/copper seals, and numerous impressions of them, "...lead us to suppose that some form of commercial business was carried on in this part of the site [PK.C]"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_PkPostU]; and processing remains suggest that there were craft specialists at Pirak.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_PkPostU] There may therefore have been some form of administrative levels, but this is not certain.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious levels ♣ 1 ♥</b> There is no evidence of a systematic religion at Pirak at this time.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_PkPostU] There is little evidence for an integrated religious system, as regional cultures split from the previous Mature Harappan system.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_PkPostU] In the broader context of the Mature Harappan there is evidence for priests, and Kenoyer refers to "ritual specialist".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_PkPostU]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Military levels ♣ [0-1] ♥</b> There is no evidence of organized warfare at Pirak at this time.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_PkPostU]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Professions">Professions</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional military officers ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> There is no evidence of organized warfare at Pirak at this time.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_PkPostU]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional soldiers ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> There is no evidence of organized warfare at Pirak at this time.

XXXV, A), they [seals found at Mehrgahr and Pirak] are replaced after 2500 BCE by inscribed seals of the Harappan civilisation, which perhaps represent a phase of state control that is exceptional in these regions.
