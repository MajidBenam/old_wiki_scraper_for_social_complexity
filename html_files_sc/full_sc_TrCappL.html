If we divided the estimate of 5.5 million by six get about 900,000. The state was landlocked and had no port. One might expect the most populous cities in Anatolia to be outside Cappadocia on the coast. A figure of 900,000 would certainly be an upper limit. Three hundred years later, under Emperor Valerian, the province of Cappadocia was reported to have had 400,000.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_TrCappL] This seems a more reasonable figure given Cappadocia's location. Anatolia at the time of Valerian had about 6.5 million more people[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_TrCappL] - 1 million more than in 100 BCE - which means Cappadocia may have had only a sixteenth of the Turkey-in-Asia population. If we apply the same ratio to 100 BCE we get 350,000.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ ♥</b> Mazaca-Eusebeia?

The Cappadocian kingdom had some cities, including the capital Mazaca as well as Tyana, Kybistra and Hanisa [MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_TrCappL], but there is a lack of detailed evidence for the size of these cities and their importance in relation to other Cappadocian settlements [MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_TrCappL]. Without details of settlement size or population, a rough three-level settlement hierarchy can be given to Cappadocia:[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1.

These levels apply to the temple state in Cappadocia, as described by Strabo: “It is a considerable city; its inhabitants, however, consist mostly of ‘divinely inspired’ people and the sacred slaved who live in it. Its inhabitants are Kataonians, who, though in a general way classified as subjects of the king, are in most respects subject to the priest. The priest is master of the temple, and also of the sacred slaved, who, on my sojourn there, were more than six thousand in number, both men and women together. Also, considerable territory belongs to the temple, and the revenue is enjoyed by the priest. He is second in rank in Cappadocia after the king. (12.2.3)” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_TrCappL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]1.

Polybius and Strabo were the main (Roman) historians of the time, and although they did not often discuss Cappadocia directly, they to refer to the region in relation to the expansion of the Roman Empire and the politics of the neighbouring polities. Polybius, c. 200-after 118 (?) BCE: “Although Polybius wrote various historical works (Tactics, a history of the Numantine War in Spain, a geographical work on equatorial regions, and an encomium of Philopoemen - all lost), he is justly famous for his Histories. The work focused on the period 220-168 when Rome established her control over most of the inhabited world, which Polybius saw as a unique event, but it also covered the years 264-220 and 186-146. Parts of the 40 books exist in their entirety, parts in excerpts.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_56_TrCappL] Strabo, born in 64 BCE, "... wrote Historical Memoranda in 47 books, from the end of Polybius to (?) the fall of Alexandria to Octavian, and notably 17 books (which survive) of geography-in which he includes much history, legend, antiquities, and ethnography- with explicit awareness of their potential utility to public men. The Geography invaluably preserves much information about the work of the earlier Greek geographers, especially the great Alexandrian scholar Eratosthenes.”[MAJIDBENAM_REF_57_TrCappL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Philosophy ♣  ♥</b>unknown</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Scientific literature ♣  ♥</b> unknown</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Fiction ♣ inferred present ♥</b><br/></div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Money">Money</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Articles ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Tokens ♣ ♥</b> unknown</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Precious metals ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Foreign coins ♣ ♥</b> unknown</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Indigenous coins ♣ present ♥</b>Bronze coins were cast from the time of the early Cappadocian dynasts.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_58_TrCappL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_59_TrCappL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Paper currency ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Postal_System">Postal System</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Couriers ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Postal stations ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ General postal service ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div></body></html>
