Very rough estimate from the varying descriptions of Judean territory. Records are not precise enough to provide finer-grained estimates by king.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ ♥</b> People.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Leibner,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_IlJudea] in his archaeological survey of the Southeastern Galilee exclusively, estimates a population of some 10,000 people based on the distribution of pottery fragments, but acknowledges a possible range from 4,000 to 17,000. From the archaeological record, it seems that prior to the Hasmoneans, the Galilee was sparsely settled; the Hasmoneans conquered the territory and began a massive wave of Jewish settlement, suggesting strong demographic pressures within the Judean heartland.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_IlJudea]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ [10,000-100,000] ♥</b> Inhabitants. The population size of Jerusalem is the subject of wildly different views. Tacitus believed that during the Jewish revolt of 66-73 CE (some years after the Hasmonean period ended), Jerusalem had some 600,000 inhabitants; archaeological estimates of the population within the defensive walls range between 80,000[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_IlJudea] and 20,000[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_IlJudea] (which is almost certainly far too low; Geva assumes that much of the enclosed territory of Jerusalem was actually uninhabited, being royal or Temple precincts, but it is hard to imagine that such extensive buildings and fortifications could have been produced by so few people). Both estimates are based on population-density coefficients; however, it is not clear that the coefficients in use are reasonable. "Some of the densities recently put forward for area coefficients have been based on unwalled, premodern villages…. How similar is such a village to a walled Bronze or Iron Age town or city? Although this is not a case of comparing apples and oranges (more like oranges and grapefruit), it seems probable that the economic constraints of building a defensive system put a permanent physical limit on the settlement area," leading to higher population densities.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_IlJudea] (Another possibility that I have seen noted, but not in the scholarly literature, is that much of the population associated with a given ANE city might not have lived inside its walls at all, but would be semi-nomadic pastoralists circulating within its economic orbit. Such pastoralists would leave little trace archaeologically, which would pose problems for conventional population estimates.)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]In any event, Jerusalem is generally believed to have grown significantly under the rule of Herod Antipas, immediately after the Hasmonean era ended.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hierarchical_Complexity">Hierarchical Complexity</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ 3 ♥</b> levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Speaking exclusively of Southeastern Galilee, Leibner comments: "[Almost] all of the large settlements (20 dunams and greater) are located at the margins of the valleys or abutting extensive patches of alluvial soil…. This is also true among the smaller sites; most are located in proximity to extensive agricultural plains.… [and] near a permanent water source. The pattern that emerges is of a series of medium and large-sized settlements near extensive areas suitable for agriculture… most fortified or at the very least with natural fortifications. In addition to these, there are a few small settlements [of less than 10 dunams area], mostly in fortified locations, with no small farms at all in the agricultural areas."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_IlJudea][MAJIDBENAM_BR]1.
