Sanders et al. (1979) tentatively estimated that there were approx. 5,000 people in the Basin of Mexico at the end of the Early Formative Period c.1150 BC, and approx. 25,000 people in the Basin of Mexico at the end of the Middle Formative Period c.650 BC.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_50_MxFormE] These estimates are "tentative" because they involve numerous arbitrary estimations. Not only were non-surveyed areas' populations guessed at, but Early and Middle Formative cermaics were mis-diagnosed in the BOM archaeological surveys, and subsequent re-evaluations of the survey ceramic collections by Tolstoy indicated that numerous Early Formative sites were embedded within Middle Formative sites (but their physical extent was no longer calculable).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_51_MxFormE][MAJIDBENAM_REF_52_MxFormE] Revisions of the Formative survey data based on Tolstoy's findings have not been published. Additionally, Tolstoy, Fish, and Niederberger have found a poor correspondence between subsurface remains and surface scatters' density and extent, leading to systematic underestimation of Formative sites' areas and populations.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_53_MxFormE][MAJIDBENAM_REF_54_MxFormE][MAJIDBENAM_REF_55_MxFormE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ [1,000-4,000] ♥</b> "Using mortuary analyses Tostoy (1989) estimated [Tlatilco] to have housed approximately 1,000 inhabitants over 40ha [...] Sanders and colleagues (1979) placed the populaation of Tlatilco as high as 1,500". In a recent personal communication, David Carballo suggests a rough estimate of".2-4k". for Tlatilco at this time.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_56_MxFormE][MAJIDBENAM_REF_57_MxFormE] From 1500-1150 BCE, the sites of Coapexco, Tlatilco, and Tlapacoya/Ayotla were inhabited by approx. 1000-2000 people.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_58_MxFormE][MAJIDBENAM_REF_59_MxFormE][MAJIDBENAM_REF_60_MxFormE] During the Middle Formative, the site of Temamatla had as many as 2160 people.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_61_MxFormE] While Sanders et al. (1979) estimated the population of Cuicuilco to have been 2500 in the Early Formative and 5000 in the Middle Formative,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_62_MxFormE] more recent research has indicated that Cuicuilco wasn't even inhabited until c.700 BC at the earliest.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_63_MxFormE]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hierarchical_Complexity">Hierarchical Complexity</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ [2-3] ♥</b> levels.

They were discovered during a salvage excavation just north of Mexico City, with only several cuts of them being exposed, so their full extent is poorly understood. These channels run from a former incised seasonal torrent (<i>barranca</i>, which may itself have been modified) at approx 90 degrees, fanning out into to individual fields. It is unclear whether these are smaller channels that emanate from a larger canal, or whether each of them directly directly siphoned the barranca. Prior to construction, the area may have been exposed to erosive sheet flow from the barranca during heavy rain, which may suggest that the system was primarily aimed at mitigating the damaging effects of natural inundation. Since the ancient barranca was not excavated, it is unclear whether dams were used to control/manage flow, or whether they only funneled excess runoff.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_118_MxFormE][MAJIDBENAM_REF_119_MxFormE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ drinking water supply systems ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> None have been found, and given the abundance of streams, springs, and freshwater lakes in the region during the Formative, and it seems unlikely that household water supplies would have been necessary.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_120_MxFormE][MAJIDBENAM_REF_121_MxFormE][MAJIDBENAM_REF_122_MxFormE][MAJIDBENAM_REF_123_MxFormE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ markets ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> The first possible evidence for markets does not occur until the Late/Terminal Formative[MAJIDBENAM_REF_124_MxFormE] or Classic Period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_125_MxFormE][MAJIDBENAM_REF_126_MxFormE][MAJIDBENAM_REF_127_MxFormE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ food storage sites ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> None exist in the rather scanty archaeological record, and individual households and residential clusters stored their own food in storage pits.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_128_MxFormE][MAJIDBENAM_REF_129_MxFormE][MAJIDBENAM_REF_130_MxFormE][MAJIDBENAM_REF_131_MxFormE][MAJIDBENAM_REF_132_MxFormE]</div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Transport_infrastructure">Transport infrastructure</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Roads ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> regional and long-distance trade was common,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_133_MxFormE][MAJIDBENAM_REF_134_MxFormE] and a system of foot paths existed during the Postclassic,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_135_MxFormE] but no evidence of roads exist in the limited archaeological record of the Early Formative.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Bridges ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> regional and long-distance trade (crossing rivers) was common,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_136_MxFormE][MAJIDBENAM_REF_137_MxFormE] but no evidence of bridges exists in the limited archaeological record of the Early Formative</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Canals ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> canals for transportation purposes would not be developed until the later Postclassic around Tenochtitlan, when they were needed to logistically transport goods through chinampas, dyke systems, and the city itself.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_138_MxFormE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ports ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> lacustrine ports would not be developed until the later Postclassic at Tenochtitlan when they were needed to logistically unload goods onto the urban island; otherwise beaches were used to land canoes.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_139_MxFormE]</div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Special_purpose_sites">Special purpose sites</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Mines or quarries ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Abundant stone and obsidian craft production indicates that raw materials were mined away from settlements.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_140_MxFormE][MAJIDBENAM_REF_141_MxFormE][MAJIDBENAM_REF_142_MxFormE][MAJIDBENAM_REF_143_MxFormE][MAJIDBENAM_REF_144_MxFormE][MAJIDBENAM_REF_145_MxFormE]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Information">Information</span></h3><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Writing_System">Writing System</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Mnemonic devices ♣ present ♥</b> Present since the Archaic Period c. 10 ka.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_146_MxFormE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Nonwritten records ♣ present ♥</b> First evidence in the Early Formative period (1500-1000 BCE).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_147_MxFormE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Written records ♣ absent ♥</b> "Absent in the Basin, present in lowland Mesoamerica c. 100 BCE-900CE."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_148_MxFormE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Script ♣ absent ♥</b> First evidence in Teotihuacan c. 200 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_149_MxFormE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Phonetic alphabetic writing ♣ absent ♥</b>[MAJIDBENAM_REF_150_MxFormE]</div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Kinds_of_Written_Documents">Kinds of Written Documents</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Lists, tables, and classifications ♣ absent ♥</b>[MAJIDBENAM_REF_151_MxFormE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Calendar ♣ absent ♥</b> First evidence in Mesoamerica c. 500 BCE.
