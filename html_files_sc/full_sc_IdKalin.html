An estimate of around 900 residents is available for Gilimanuk in Bali, but this is deduced from estimates of the total number of burials, the site's longevity, and the mortality rate."

Before 500CE: "The archaeological record is yet to evince anything like the cities in Central Java, complete with streets, which some Chinese visitors reported as hearsay at about 1650 B.P. (Hall 1992: 194). However, Java and Bali certainly do present evidence of larger habitations, pre-1500 B.P., than had been established elsewhere in the archipelago. An average population of around 900 people has been estimated for Gilimanuk, which then may have been effectively a tiny island off Bali's northwest coast (Soegondho 1995: 16-18). Elsewhere along the north coast, too, there is a persistent pattern of designated cemeteries within the settlement (Prasetyo 1994/1995), or else of burials underlying much of the settlement (Sukendar et al. 1982). This suggests nucle- ated villages whose inhabitants staked their claim to residence through burial of the ancestors within the village perimeter. A circular hole of 30 cm diameter at Anyar, West Java (Sukendar et al. 1982: 9), may reflect a house pile. Sukendar (1986) interpreted one circle of upright stones at Bandowoso, in East Java's hinterland, as the stone piles for a ceremonial center, and Van Heekeren (1958: 48) offered a similar interpretation for the rectangular arrangements of stone uprights at the nearby site of Pakauman. Pakauman also contains a stone statue, presumed to represent an ancestor, as well as stone sarcophagi and dolmens. These Early Metal Phase megalithic complexes crop up on the volcanic soils in the flatter hinterland reaches right along Bali and Java, as well as the Lampung and Pagar Alam districts of Southern Sumatra (e.g. Bellwood 1997; Van Heekeren 1958)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_IdKalin][MAJIDBENAM_BR]At the onset of the next period: "Like Sanjaya, initially the Sailendra leaders were rakrayan, or regional leaders, rulers of a watak that integrated village clusters (wanua) participating in a regional irrigation and/or otherwise networked society. As rakrayan, these earliest Sailendra rulers provided the political stability necessary to maintain the local irrigation and marketing networks, and through their patronage of Indic religion they constructed sacred cults to legitimize the regional integration of wanua into watak."

Before 500 CE: "Marked social stratification into a hereditary aristocracy, with privileged access to wealth and the power of life and death over slaves, is widely evidenced. Bali's sarcophagi have been classified into 74 small (0.8-1.4 m in length), seven intermediate (1.5-1.7 m), and six large sarcophagi (2.0-2.7 m long), of which the latter all fall within 10 km of Manuaba (the site of a Pejeng stone mold). These tiers may correspond to increasingly exclusive ranks in the aristocracy and the centralization of prestige in the Manuaba area (Ardika 1987: 4, 42-44). The richly furnished child buried inside a Dong Son drum at Plawangan (Prasetyo 1994/1995: 19, 39) seems to be the prematurely deceased incumbent to the local chieftainship."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_IdKalin] Chiefs seemingly attested before the Kalingga period.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The story of the north Indian Buddhist pilgrim Gunavarman records the emergence of Holing (central Java) as a political entity. In 422, Gunavarman stopped at Holing on his way to China. He stayed there for several years, patronized by the queen mother and preaching Buddhist doctrine with great success; the king of Holing asked Gunavarman’s advice on whether to attack his enemies (Pelliot: 1904, 274-75). Herein in the Chinese accounts, the emergence of Holing from what was previously a tribal society involved competition among several communities and the productive outreach by one to a potential Indian advisor. This, like the Funan origin myth detailed in chapter 2, reflects the actual or symbolic use of Indic culture as the basis for the establishment of one enterprising chiefdom’s supremacy over its regional rivals. Holing sent envoys to China in 430 and 440 but is not mentioned in sixth-century Chinese records, suggesting that international contact with central Java was limited until two centuries later, when in the 640s and 660s Holing again sent embassies and around 640 welcomed a Chinese monk who remained to study under a Javanese Buddhist master (Pelliot: 1904, 286-88; Meulen: 1977, 90)."

The farmers and artisans of the villages took their produce, principally rice, salt, beans, and dyestuffs, to a periodic farmers' market that came to them every so many days, according to a fixed schedule. There they could find merchants who travelled with this market from place to place. The travelling merchants bought the local produce and passed it along in exchanges with intermediary wholesalers. Then merchants from the ports of Java's north coast purchased the produce from the wholesalers and sold it to merchants who travelled the seas, who delivered it to the ports where international merchants congregated. There were thus at least four layers of merchants and of markets between central Java's rice producers and the international traders.23" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_IdKalin]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ food storage sites ♣ ♥</b></div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Transport_infrastructure">Transport infrastructure</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Roads ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Bridges ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Canals ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ports ♣ inferred present ♥</b> “Central Java has been the dwelling place of humans and their supposed predecessors since the earliest times, and the world’s oldest human remains have been found in that island, specifically around Merapi.
