The smaller Tabalian kingdoms are examples of the former, Hamath and Bit-Burutash of the latter." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_TrNHitt][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Tabal --- the region[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Tabal covered much of what was called the Lower Land in Late Bronze Age Hittite texts, including the territory of the Classical Tyanitis. Westwards, it extended to the Konya Plain, encompassing the sites now known as Kizildag and Karadag. The region had been integrated into Hittite territory, probably very early in Hittite history, and served as a kind of southern and south-western buffer zone to the Hittite homeland." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_TrNHitt][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Northern Tabal (Tabal 'Proper') --- a kingdom in the region of Tabal[MAJIDBENAM_BR]ruling line possibly dates to mid-9th century BCE but could be earlier [MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_TrNHitt][MAJIDBENAM_BR]largest of the Tabal Kingdoms, probably contained sub-regions [MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_TrNHitt][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"it corresponded roughly to the modern provinces of Kayseri and Nigde." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_TrNHitt][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Carchemish --- may have had some control over Konya Plain region after the fall of the Hittite Empire?[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"If one identifies the agricultural hinterland of Karkamis with the plains and valleys west of the river and excludes the mountainous regions to the north, the territory of the kingdom can be assessed at over 750 km2."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_TrNHitt]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ [80,000-160,000] ♥</b>New Kingdom of Hatti coded 2 million for up to 45,000 km2, which is 44.4 per km2. Neo-Hittite state of 700 km2 * 44.4 density per km2 would provide an estimate of about 30,000. However, the Neo-Hittite states were no doubt based around the larger urban areas so this could be a bottom line figure. Considering that there would need to be 100 such states in the region of Turkey to reach the 3 million population figure (for Turkey - see McEvedy and Jones estimate) this "bottom line" figure may be too low. 3 million split among, say, 15 states in Turkey as a whole would give us 200,000 per polity. This seems closer to a reasonable range of perhaps 80,000-160,000.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Turkey contained 3 million "during the course of the full Bronze age".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_TrNHitt][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ [12,000-18,000] ♥</b> 18,000 if we use Carchemish as an outside of NGA analogue at 200 per 90ha.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Carchemish (outside NGA region unless Carchemish had some control over Konya Plain region in early period)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The area enclosed by the outer wall covered more than 90 ha, which made it the largest urban centre in the region."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_TrNHitt][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hierarchical_Complexity">Hierarchical Complexity</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ 3 ♥</b>1.

King[MAJIDBENAM_BR]many Neo-Hittite rulers took the titles "Great King" and "Hero".[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"There are inscriptions that identify Kuzi-Teshub as Great King of Carchemish and son of Talmi-Teshub, the last-known Hittite viceroy at Carchemish. They indicate that at least one branch of the royal dynasty survived the fall of the empire and continued to exert authority through the early decades of the Iron Age. Since Hattusa was abandoned c.1185, Kuzi-Teshub's rule at Carchemish must date to the first half of the 12th century. His title 'Great King' is a significant one. No subordinate ruler within the Hittite kingdom, even a viceroy, would have used such a title while there was still a central regime at Hattusa."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_TrNHitt][MAJIDBENAM_BR]2.
