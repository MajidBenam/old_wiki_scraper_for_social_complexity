[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_GrCrPPa]. The size of these towns varies from 4 to 54 ha. Some were densely occupied while habitation in others was more dispersed, suggesting a trend toward a ruralization of the urban setting. Data points to a four-tiered  hierarchy:  the large town is surrounded by villages, hamlets, and farmhouses. The most important centers were Kydonia (Chania), in west Crete and Hagia Triada, in south-central Crete. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_GrCrPPa] The reference to a <i>wanax</i> (king) in the inscription painted on the shoulder of some inscribed stirrup jars, produced in the area of west Crete, prompting the speculation for the presence of a "palatial" authority. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_GrCrPPa] By the end of Late Minoan IIIB most settlements had suffered destruction or abandonment.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Administrative levels ♣ 4 ♥</b>  1-4 The only centre which provided evidence for Linear B administration during the Late Minoan IIIB period is Kydonia (Chania). It is very likely that administration was organized as in the Mycenaean states. The supreme leader of the state was the king (<i>wanax</i>). [MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_GrCrPPa] The reference to a <i>wanax</i> (king) in the inscription painted on the shoulder of some inscribed stirrup jars, produced in the area of west Crete, prompting the speculation for the presence of a "palatial" authority. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_GrCrPPa] He presided over the political, economic and religious  hierarchy. It is not certain thought if he had any military and judicial duty. Ranked second was the <i>lawagetas</i>,  a military leader. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_GrCrPPa] Below these leaders were the <i>hequetai</i>, followers,  who accompanied military contingents and may also performed other functions. Other officials, the so-called collectors, were involved in acquiring and distributing exchange commodities. Among the figures at a lower level were the <i>qasireu</i> who served as overseer of group of workers -the predecessor of the word known from ancient Greek as the word for the king (baseless) - the <i>telestas</i> , officials, the <i>korete</i> and <i>porokorete</i>, mayor and vice-mayor, and scribes. Administration also occurred in the other major regional centers of the period (e.g. Hagia Triada) and probably followed these established during the Monopalatial period (1450-1300 BCE). Data, however, is rather meagre.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious levels ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> In Mycenaean states, the <i>wanax</i> is the head of the religious hierarchy.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_GrCrPPa]  It very likely that the administration of the local polity was organized in a three-tiered hierarchical system of bureaucratic control: a) the central bureaucracy located in the palace (or adjacent subsidiary structures) at the town, to b)  local officials and representatives of Palace residing  in the second-order centers scattered in the polity’s districts, down to c) collective groups and individuals of various occupations and social standings in the small settlements within these districts.

Palatial institutions were seen as the only regulators of any economic transaction. Acting as redistributive agents, they were thought to draw upon raw materials and labour from the hinterland in order to produce and distribute specialized artisanal goods.  In recent years, however, new perspectives have effectively challenged not only the redistributive role of governing institutions but also the negative attitude towards the existence of market and market-like systems in the Aegean. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_GrCrPPa] Once people started looking for them, markets have begun to appear in much earlier chronological horizons, shaping the emergence of state administrative institutions. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_GrCrPPa] ( Garraty and Stark 2010). Although there are some constrains in recognizing and understanding markets in prehistoric societies, the market is an economic process which should developed further in Bronze Age Crete.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ food storage sites ♣present♥</b> e.g. the extensive public storerooms at Hagia Triada.
