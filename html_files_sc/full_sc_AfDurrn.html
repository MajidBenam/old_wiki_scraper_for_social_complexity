The second date reflects the loss of external territories by the beginning of the nineteenth century. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_AfDurrn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Conquests including former territory of the Mughal and Maratha Empires in India, the Afsharid Empire of Persia, and the Khanate of Bukhara.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_AfDurrn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In 1757 CE, the Durrani sacked Delhi and dealt a deathblow to the formerly powerful Moghul Empire. This resulted in the conquest of Punjab, the Sindh, and the Kachi plains.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_AfDurrn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]After 1809 CE, the East India company signed the Treaty of Amritsar with a Sikh Maharaja named Ranjit Singh. Following an agreement to halt expansion southward, Singh conquered Multan and the Kachi plains in 1818 CE, Kashmir in 1819 CE, and finally Peshawar in 1823 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_AfDurrn]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hierarchical_Complexity">Hierarchical Complexity</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ [3-4] ♥</b> 3: 1766 CE; 1: 1779 CE. The Durrani ruled from the sparsely populated and rural Pashtun region of Afghanistan. As such, the settlement hierarchy was inverse to the majority of empires in that the large populated cities were underneath the power of a much smaller and extractive rural elite. After the death of the first Shah, internal conflict meant that effective control was limited to the city of Kabul and the surrounding countryside.

Military service was rewarded with the granting of autonomous land grants called Jegeirs that skimmed up to sixty percent of state revenues, with the remainder going to the maintenance of a large army. The local elites were mantained and largely autonomous if appropriate tribute was paid to the tribal elites. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_AfDurrn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]1. Shah[MAJIDBENAM_BR]2.

All Muslims[MAJIDBENAM_BR]In theory the Caliphate and governors were the head of the Sunni faith, but in practice local religious scholars (ulama) attracted the wider populace as definers of doctrine.

One third were regular troops largely made up of cavalry and some supporting artillery, with the remaining two thirds made up of irregular seasonal troops serving for a campaign. The standing army hierarchy is reflected below. They were paid in cash or with military fiefs in the rich provinces in India. Irregular troops were raised via a coercive levy imposed on subjected tribes, districts and chieftains, and these areas were required to equip the troops themselves.

He also had access to the Turkish Shiite Qizilbash. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_AfDurrn]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional soldiers ♣ present ♥</b> Roughly one in three members of the Durrani military were full time professional fighters. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_AfDurrn]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional priesthood ♣ absent ♥</b>Sunni Islam did not have the equivalent of a professional priest. The leader of the daily prayers was given a special title and a person widely thought to be learned would be awarded a title of Imam, but this did not connote a hierarchy of belief. Certain originators of judiciary schools were awarded special titles, but these rare individuals were not the equivalent of saints. The increasing fractured nature of Sunni and Shiite religious controversy led to a divergence in the use of titles to members of the umma. In Afghanistan, local practice could be widely divergent from mainstream Islam.

It was not based on a defined permanent theory of statecraft, but rather a synthesis  of of Islamic concepts of kingship. Governance took place in part through  a loose council of Durrani Sadozai Chieftans. What short term Administrative post that did exist were given to members of the governing tribes. The Duranni were a nation in arms rather than bureaucrats.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_AfDurrn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/>Shari'a law functioned at a local level, but an overarching legal structure was not present given the fractured nature of the empire and the focus on coercive extraction. Legal rights seem to have been, like the late Mugals, restricted to Muslims. Unbelievers were to be kept subdued, and be made to pay the traditional poll tax.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_AfDurrn] In legitimizing their conquest, the Durrani seem to have followed the Sunni school of law of maḏāhib. The presence of Shiite practioners in Khorasan seem to have been tolerated. Pitshtunwali, a legal and moral code that determines social order and responsibilities in Pashtun culture was at odds with the formalized Islamic code, having existed before the islamic conquest of the 7th century and enduring to the present day in the Pashtun border regions.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_AfDurrn]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Judges ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> The Ulama were scholars of Islamic thought who also served as lawyers.
