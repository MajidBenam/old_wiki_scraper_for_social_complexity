The Gahadavala dynasty are sometimes considered Rajputs or perhaps proto-Rajputs as strictly speaking the Rajputs date from a later time in this location: In the Pratihara empire "Extensive tracts ... were under feudatories bound to their overlords by ties and terms of service ... The rest of the empire can be grouped under the heads bhuati, mandala, zisaya, pathaka, chuturasitika and dvadesaka, bhukti was the biggest division. Next to it was the mandala. It was sub-divided into visayas; subdividion that we find also in feudatory States like Sakambhari. The pathaka stood next to it. The Varanasi Visaya had a division called Kasiparapathaka. .... it can be further concluded that the pathaka was a union of villages, the number of which could vary."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_InGhdvl] "The kotta or durga may be regarded as a representative of the durga constituent of a saptanga rajya. It included not the fort alone but also the territory adjoining it."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_InGhdvl] "The smallest administrative unit was of course the village."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_InGhdvl] "The defence of the town and its overal supervision fell within the jurisdiction of the Kottapala; but the management of civil affairs was left to a non-official body, the members of which had their turn in the management of the sthana, and were therefore known as varikas. Attached to it must have been a permanent office like the one a Pehoa which kept a record of transactions and agreements ... Its secretary might have been designated Karanika."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_InGhdvl] An imperial officer, called tantrapala in a Harsa inscription of Vigraharaja II and some others, probably was tasked with "keeping the feudatories in check, looking after the interests of his master on the borders of his empire, and using diplomacy as well as force, to gain his objective. He was authorised also to make grants and sign important documents on behalf of his master."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_InGhdvl] "The head of a visaya might have been known as the vasayapati but we have no idea of the titles used for the heads of the divisions lower than a visaya."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_InGhdvl][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Bhukti - Mandala - Visayas - Pathaka (union of villages) - Kotta/Durga? - Village[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/><b>♠ Religious levels ♣ ♥</b> levels.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Military levels ♣ ♥</b> levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Under chapter 9 "The Rajput Administration" pages 389-403 includes section on military administration.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_InGhdvl][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/>From an essay on "The Rajput Administration".
