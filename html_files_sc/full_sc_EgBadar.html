But also, there was a large number of small sites near the villages of Qau el-Kebir, Hammamiya, Mostagedda, and Matmar[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_EgBadar]. However, characteristic Badarian findings have also been located much further South, at Mahgar Dendera, Armant, Elkab, and Hierakonpolis, and also to the East, in the Wadi Hammamat[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_EgBadar][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Research on Badarian sites yielded a total of about 600 graves and forty poorly documented settlements. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_EgBadar] Were these settlements all one polity? Possibly. Analysis of Badarian grave goods demonstrates an unequal distribution of wealth and the wealthier graves tend to be separated in one part of the cemetery. This clearly indicates social stratification.

Information from the Badarian remains shows that they imported raw materials like wood, turquoise, shells and ivory. Additionally, some artifacts have been found that are proof of trade exchange with e.g. Palestine, Red Sea, Syria.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/></div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Special_purpose_sites">Special purpose sites</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Mines or quarries ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Information">Information</span></h3><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Writing_System">Writing System</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Mnemonic devices ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Nonwritten records ♣ present ♥</b> The earliest art productions are rock-drawings executed on the cliffs bordering the Nile in Upper Egypt.
