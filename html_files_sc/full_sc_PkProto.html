It is seems very likely that Pirak was once part of a larger assemblage of culturally similar settlements, but, perhaps due to the erosive effects of nearby rivers, only Pirak remains[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_PkProto] Of course it's difficult to say whether these hypothetical settlements were part of the same polity as Pirak.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ [450-1800] ♥</b> Assuming 50-200 people per ha and 9 ha, we have an estimate of 450-1800. “The extent of the built up areas [of Pirak] remains practically constant, almost 9 hectares, and the apparent conservatism of the material culture are factors that bear witness to an undeniable stability of the settlement.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_PkProto] but "...it has proved impossible for the moment to define in a less summary fashion its probable area of geographical distribution. As far as the region is concerned, the mound of Pirak is the only one of its kind."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_PkProto]. Although, the material culture found at Pirak has also been uncovered in a much wider area in the north of the Kachi Plain [MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_PkProto], and as far as southern Central Asia and the Ganges valley.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_PkProto] The population of Pirak has not been estimated.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_PkProto]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hierarchical_Complexity">Hierarchical Complexity</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ [1-2] ♥</b> Inferred. Pirak is the best-preserved site in the Kachi Plain from this time. Although other sites such as Pathani Damb have also been found, it is difficult to estimate their extent due to the poor preservation of the site. “Although no systematic surveys have been carried out in the Kachi plain, it appears that this region lying between highland Baluchistan and the Indus valley was occupied without break by sizable settlements throughout the second and into the first millennium BC.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_PkProto][MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_PkProto]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Administrative levels ♣ [1-2] ♥</b> levels.

Attempts by scholars such as Maurizio Tosi to find evidence of differentiation and increasing complexity were not born out by the evidence. While recording systems are present, stamp seals and sealing, these appeared to be quite localized in terms of their production.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_PkProto] There is one building that might have fulfilled some sort of administrative role during Pirak II.
