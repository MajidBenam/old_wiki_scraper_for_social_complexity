As a result, his empire became huge as never before. To cite Hamblin: "He created the largest empire the world had yet known, stretching from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean, and encompassing  most of modern Iraq and Syria, and over twice the size in population and land of contemporary Egypt. From another perspective, however, Sargon's empire was what we would call today a humanitarian disaster, for "the god Enlil instructed [Sargon to conquer the world] and he showed mercy to no one"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_IqAkkad][MAJIDBENAM_BR]c2200 BCE (actually later)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1,100,000 maximum extent - much larger than presented on current maps.

The agreement was between Naram-Sin and the king of Elam, who is recognised as a political and legal representative of Elam. However, it is true that, after these last attestations, the dynasty of Awan seems to have disappeared.

Therefore, Akkad's interest was mainly commercial. This interest was secured through treaties with states too strong to be subdued (such as in the case of Elam), or through the appointment of a local ensi (such as the sankanakku of Mari). Another possibility was the creation of Akkadian strongholds in foreign territories, such as Naram-Sin's palace at Naga (Tell-Brak). This was probably not the only palace built by Akkadian rulers, and was possibly the most suitable way to keep a vast commercial network under control."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_78_IqAkkad][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Rimash created a royal domain out of 134,000 hectares of agricultural land near Lagash and Umma in Sumer and distributed it among his retainers.

In principle, all of them could voice opinions, but in practice key decisions, such as declaration of war, were made by a subgroup of elders who appointed a war leader in time of threat."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_80_IqAkkad] "The assembly had control over local land resources through approving major real estate transactions. It could also set prices, fines, taxes, undertake public works and other communal actions, and administer property, which originally included the temple before it evolved as a separate great household. In addition, the assembly exercised general control over administrative and governmental activity on the local level."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_81_IqAkkad] -- however, "no direct evidence for such an assembly exists in Akkadian sources, even among the many legal documents for the period".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_82_IqAkkad] "records refer to a 'mayor' (rabianum), perhaps a headman of a tribe or settlement, who mediated disputes, was responsible for dealing with crime, and recruited men for labor and military service. Others mention multiple "elders," who carried out many of the same functions. Still others refer to the 'town' or 'city,' local notables who oversaw such matters as the conduct of business and commerce; this suggests the existence of a city corporation or government. ... For a village or rural area, a mayor or elders might have sufficed, whereas a larger agglomeration with a market and several local institutions might have had a 'town' or 'city' board."
