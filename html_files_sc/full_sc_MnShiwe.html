In the Tang period, it is known that there were twenty Shiwei tribes, according to the records in dynastic histories. They were the Wusugu, Yisaimo, Saiezhi, Hejie, Wuluohu, Nali, Lingxi, Shanbei, Huangtou, Da Ruzhe, Xiao Ruzhe, Powo, Nebeizhi, Luotuo, Dong Shiwei, Xi Shiwei, Da Shiwei, Mengwu Shiwei, Luozu Shiwei and Dagui." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_MnShiwe][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Summing up the above discussion, the four boundaries of all the Shiwei tribes in the Tang Dynasty can be approximately described by the following: the eastern boundary was the modern Jingqili River; the western was the west of the modern Lake Hulun; the northern was the modern Sea of Okhotsk; and the southern was the south of the modern Huoli River."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_MnShiwe]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣  ♥</b> People.

Tribal leaders[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The Wuluohou, who were believed a component part of the Shiwei tribal complex, inhabited the northwestern part of Manchuria. The Wuluohou’s pattern of succession in the period of northern Wei (383-534) is recorded in the Wei Shu.  It reads, "They had no supreme leader. The position of the tribal chieftain Mofu (Mufuhe) was succeeded hereditarily".95" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_MnShiwe][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The productive activities were organized by the tribal leaders, as described in the Xin Tangshu, "in hunting (the tribes) were banded together, and dispersed afterward; the tribes did not rule over one another or submitted to one another".103 It can be seen that no united tribal confederation had been formed yet by the Shiwei. Compared with their southern neighbors the Khitan, and the eastern neighbors, the Mohe, in the same period, the social organization of the Shiwei was not as developed. On account of their lower level of social organization, as declared in the Xin Tangshu, "they finally could not become a strong power, although they were valiant and belligerent".104" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_MnShiwe][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/><b>♠ Religious levels ♣ ♥</b> levels.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Military levels ♣ ♥</b> levels.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Professions">Professions</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional military officers ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional soldiers ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional priesthood ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bureaucracy_characteristics">Bureaucracy characteristics</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Full-time bureaucrats ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Examination system ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Merit promotion ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Specialized government buildings ♣ absent ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Law">Law</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Formal legal code ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Judges ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Courts ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional Lawyers ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Specialized_Buildings:_polity_owned">Specialized Buildings: polity owned</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ irrigation systems ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ drinking water supply systems ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ markets ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ food storage sites ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> "The Shiwei people produced millet, wheat and sorghum to the north of the Khitan."
