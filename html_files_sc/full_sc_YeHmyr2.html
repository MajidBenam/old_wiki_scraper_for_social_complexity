Moreover, they do not take into account the recent archaeological surveys conducted in the 1990s that demostrate a rather densely populated plateau...

"'Athtar almost always occupies first place in lists and his cult was spread throughout the region."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_75_YeHmyr2] Different polities/people had their own god. "The patron deity (shym) of a people was of more immediate significance in south Arabia than the remoter figure of 'Athtar. The four principal peoples had as their patrons Almaqah (Sabaeans), Wadd (Minaeans), 'Amm (Qatabanians) and Sayin (Hadramites), and each people was collectively termed the 'chrildren of their respective patron deity."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_76_YeHmyr2] The pagan religion of South Arabia "was in its essence a planetary astral system in which the cult of the moon-god prevailed. The moon, known in Hadramawt as Sin, to the Minaeans as Wadd (love or lover, father), to the Sabaeans as Almaqah (the health-giving god?) and to the Qatabanians as 'Amm (paternal uncle), stood at the head of the pantheon. He was conceived of as a masculine deity and took precedence over the sun, Shams, who was his consort. 'Athtar (Venus, corresponding to the Babylonian goddess Ishtar, Phoenician 'Ashtart), their son, was the third member of the triad. From this celestial pair sprang the many other heavenly bodies considered divine."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_77_YeHmyr2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The pagan Himyarites likely worshipped Almaqah from the time the kingdom was combined with Saba. Hitti writes that the "Himyarites were close kinsmen of the Sabaeans and, as the youngest branch of the sock, became the inheritors of the Minaeo-Sabaean culture and trade."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_78_YeHmyr2] The Himyarites worshipped Almaqah, 'Athtar and other deities.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_79_YeHmyr2] Philostorgius said of the Himyarites: 'They sacrifice to the sun and moon and spirits of the land.'"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_80_YeHmyr2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The pagan Himyarites practiced dedications to temples[MAJIDBENAM_REF_81_YeHmyr2] which were likely sufficiently complex to archive papyrus legal statements concerning the usage of tombs.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_82_YeHmyr2] Minaean carvings in the temple ruins of al-Hazm, from the first millennium BCE, suggest dancing girls may have been included among the temple servants.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_83_YeHmyr2] Sabaean temples are known to have received tithes at the federal and local levels and its financing may been the "divine assistance" behind construction projects. "Some Middle 'Sabaean' temples may have acted as 'insurance companies' ... Hence the presence of some kind of insurance company which would provide assistance (to build, say, a house after it had been destroyed) was really very practical and useful for most clans. By paying their tithe ('s2r) to the local temples, the tribesmen paid a sort of 'premium' to this insurance company', whereby they could expect to get their 'compensation' when they needed it."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_84_YeHmyr2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The religion of the Himyarites was pagan and polytheistic in the period 270-375 CE and Jewish or Judaistic monotheism in the period 375-525 CE when they "fell under the influence of Jewish proselytizers"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_85_YeHmyr2] and by the late 4th century CE were rapidly converting from their pagan polytheistic belief system to monotheistic religious doctrines.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_86_YeHmyr2] "There is significant archaeological evidence of the abandonment of pagan temples toward the conclusion of the fourth century and of the almost complete disappearance of expressions of devotion to the old tribal gods shortly thereafter."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_87_YeHmyr2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"From the 4th century on the Himyarite kings were either full members or sympathizers of Judaism" and the Jewish faith became "the dominant religion" in South Arabia.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_88_YeHmyr2] "Rome's destruction of the temple in Jerusalem in A.D. 70 brought Jewish emigrants to South Arabia, as well as the Christian message."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_89_YeHmyr2] Jews also may have emigrated to Yemen after the destruction of the First Temple of Jerusalem in 587 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_90_YeHmyr2] In the later fourth century there was a Jewish dynasty of kings known as the Tabbai'a.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_91_YeHmyr2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]A list of Himyarite's known Jewish kings include: Yassirum Yohre'am (from 270 CE); 'Amr-Shlomo ben David (325-330 CE); Malki Kariba Juha'min (378-385 CE); Abu Kariba As'as (385-420 or 445 CE); Shurihbi'il Yakkuf (468-480 CE); Martad Ilan ('Judaized' 495-515 CE); Yusuf Ash'ar Dhu Nuwas (515-525 CE).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_92_YeHmyr2][MAJIDBENAM_REF_93_YeHmyr2] The Himyarite army adopted Judaism as its official religion at the start of the fifth century CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_94_YeHmyr2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Christianity also was present in Himyar at least from the first half of the 4th century[MAJIDBENAM_REF_95_YeHmyr2] when the Christian missionary Theophilus arrived and "complained that he found a great number of Jews".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_96_YeHmyr2] The Christian message was probably first carried to Arabia by hermits and traders; and, "since there was a significant Jewish presence in southern Arabia, especially in Najran, Jewish converts to Christianity could have brought the Christian message to Arabia."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_97_YeHmyr2] "By the year 350 Christian communities were established. During the fourth and fifth centuries AD, missionaries systematically converted many Arabian tribes from their traditional polytheistic practices to monotheistic Christianity, which spread throughout the area later known as Yemen."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_98_YeHmyr2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]It is also suggested that the rulers were not Jewish but Monophysite Christians. According to Friedman (2006) Himyarite colonists, the Axumites, in the land of Cush (Ethiopia) "which they renamed Axum ... converted to Monophysite Christianity at the beginning of the fourth century. Between 340 to 378, the Axumites returned to Yemen and imposed their rule and religion over the Himyarites. Although the interregnum was short-lived, the impact of the Axumites was very profound. Yemen was a Christian land, with churches and a cathedral in San'a, and all but one of the restored Himyarite monarchs (378-525) were Monophysite Christians. The lone heretic was Dhu-Nuwas who, for unknown reasons, hated Christians and converted to Judaism."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_99_YeHmyr2] Hitti also mentions the 340-378 CE period of Abyssinian rule.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_100_YeHmyr2] Evans (2000) writes: "Christianity and Judaism both struggled for the allegiance of the Himyarite kings, and at Justin's accession [518 CE], Christianity with the support of Axum had the upper hand. The king was a Christian and an Axumite vassal."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_101_YeHmyr2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]However, most scholars call the early monotheistic Himyarites Jewish or Judaistic. Christians were repressed due to a perceived association with influence of the Byzantine Empire: "in the 470s ... a priest named Azqir was executed for active proselytisation in Najran".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_102_YeHmyr2] "Dhu Nuwas (515-25), a Himyarite king, changed the state religion to -&gt; Judaism and began to massacre Christians."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_103_YeHmyr2] McLaughlin (2007) says "the last Himyarite king changed it to Judaism and killed thousands of Christians at Najran."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_104_YeHmyr2] Orlin (2016 writes that the process through which Himyar converted to Judaism is unclear - some have speculated that the influence of agents from the Palestinian Jewish community was at work - but the epigraphic proof of a transformation of the public official religion of the state is undeniable.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_105_YeHmyr2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]An inscription dated to 378 CE claimed "the completion of buildings by a Himyar monarch had been accomplished 'through the power of their lord of sky and heaven,' and phrases such as 'the owner of the sky and earth,' and the expression 'the Merciful' also were used.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_106_YeHmyr2] It has been suggested that the Himyarite "profession of monotheism, and later full-fledged Judaism, distanced the Himyarites from the Christianity of the Byzantines and their Ethiopian allies and the Zoroastrianism of the Persians"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_107_YeHmyr2] so that their strategically located state had an independent or neutral identity.

Before the first century AD the title of qayn occurs very frequently, relating the holder to a deity ... ruler ... city ... or clan ... and usually concerning the supervision of construction projects.

They are most often encountered on military campaigns ... but also performed secretarial duties, supervised building works ... and the like.
