Their oldest historical traditions are the heroic material found in the Avestan Yašts (Christensen, 1917, 1928, 1931; Boyce, Zoroastrianism I, pp. 92-108; Yarshater, pp. 411-53), in which "historical facts and accurate genealogies" are interwoven with "poetic fiction and fable." In these traditions "are seemingly preserved both secular and priestly traditions, transmitted by minstrel poets as well as by religious schools; and there are elements also of popular superstition and dread, in the tales of demons and witches and fearsome beasts. These intermingle with the stories of valour which show also the power of the gods to grant to men's prayers and succor them in distress" (Boyce, Zoroastrianism I, p. 108). With the conquest of the ancient Near East, the Iranians became familiar with cultures that had long established traditions of written history (Klima, pp. 214-17; Grayson, 1975a, pp. 1-7; G. Cameron, pp. 79-81). This led to a number of developments. Firstly, the Iranians began keeping records of historical events, of which Cyrus's Chronicle from Babylonia (see CYRUS CYLINDER) and Darius's Bisotun inscriptions (q.v.) and their Aramaic versions, which were dispatched to the empire's provinces, are the best examples. They meant to convincethe reader that "Persians were divinely appointed saviors whose mission was to bring justice, order, and tranquillity to the people of the world" (G. Cameron, pp. 81-94, esp. p. 93).

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_138_IrAchae] Darius I was probably the first Achaemenid king to mint coins. Created a single currency monetary system. Standard coin was the gold Daric which was maintained at 97% purity. 3,000 darics made one talent. Silver coins were called shekels and were at least 90% pure. Twenty shekels to one daric, for a 40:3 silver-gold ratio. The currency system was maintained from 515 BCE until 330 BCE. The reluctance of the Persian kings to release their treasure to be minted hampered the empire's economy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_139_IrAchae] Royal coinage encouraged trade. Before Darius trade was in barter or Lydian gold coins. Satraps could coin money but only King of Kings could coin in gold. Coin potraits first appeared in Persia.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_140_IrAchae]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Paper currency ♣ absent ♥</b></div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Postal_System">Postal System</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Couriers ♣ present ♥</b> Royal road basis of a courier system.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_141_IrAchae]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Postal stations ♣ present ♥</b> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_142_IrAchae] Lettered communication between central bureaucracy and the satrapies.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_143_IrAchae] "The Archaemenids introduced the world's first postal service, and it was said the network of relay horses could deliver mail to the furthest corner of the empire within 15 days."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_144_IrAchae]  "In Persia the postal service appears to have originated in the Achaemenid period. ...
