[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_USOneot]  "  There was an extensive network of footpaths that crisscrossed Eastern North America as one of your quotes suggests.  I wouldn’t really call them roads, though.  Most of them paralleled rivers and were unimproved or informal—they simply represented the best route between locations and so were used over and over.  They were not part of a formally planned transportation system."

"It would be an extraordinary coincidence if these developments were unrelated in some manner to the disappearance of the Cambria, Silvernale, and Mill Creek complexes in the region by A.D. 1300, and, more broadly, to the major cultural transitions that were occurring from the Plains to the Atlantic seaboard in the northeastern United States during the A.D. 1200-1300 period." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_USOneot] "There were still quarries being used; indeed Blood Run has a lot of material from the Pipestone National Monument in Minnesota as I recall, so that was certainly a “mine” of sorts."
