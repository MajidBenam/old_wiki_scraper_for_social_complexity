One was the particular natural of the economy which rested on the small-scale production of iron-related artefacts. The other was the substantial evidence found from sites like Kotalingala of pre-Satavahana coinage (Krishnasastry, 1983), indicating that there was a mobilization of resources at a local level, which meant that the political elite had the ability to issue their own coins. Though this is most striking in the Central Deccan because these coins are found along with the early coins of the Satavahana"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_InDecKg][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Western Deccan: "The earliest organized state in the region was that of the Satavahanas evolving out of the declining Mauryan power. The presence of the state is suggested by the evidence of political control and the use of an adminsitrative structure. References to units of adiministration and of what appear to be official designations point to a monarchical system. The title of mahamatra is suggestive of the Mauryan designation. The mahabhoja and maharathi as officials may in origin have been associated with high office in the Bhoja and Rathika clans and made the transition to administrative office when the requirements of the state demanded it. The constituents of the seven limbs of the state, the saptanga, are reflected in these and other indications such as the reference to Satavahana armies in action against the ksatrapas, to allies and enemies, to the treasury from the existence of Satavahana coins and revenue collection, to the capital from references to Pratishana and finally to the recognition of territory under Satavahana control."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_InDecKg][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In Andhra region post-Mauryans: "This appearance of kingship, currency and writing indicates that the basic infrastructures of a state system, which had been introduced in the Maurayn period, started functioning at the local level and transforming the megalithic/tribal society into proto or early states, basically characterized by centralized administration, stable kingship and social stratification."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_InDecKg][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Post-Mauryans in Krishna valley: "Amaravati inscription of this period records the existence of a royal scribe (rajalekhaka). This may indicate that record-keeping started to play an integral part in local political administration as well as in commercial activities in this period."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_InDecKg][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In Andhra region post-Mauryans: "Along with local kingships, inscriptions of this period mention other socio-political and socio-economic institutions, particularly as nigama and gothi. Although it is not possible to comprehend the precise nature of these institutions in this period of coastal Andhra, textual and epigraphic evidence indicates that a nigama was an imporant economic and social unit larger than a village (gama), and was composed of integrated members of kin groups and occupational or professional groups. A gothi (skt. gosthi), was another important economic and social institution particularly for urban elites. Bhattiprolu inscriptions also show that these urban institutions and local kings were closely connected, as the inscriptions describe the king Kuberaka as the chief (pamukha=skt. pramukha) of a nigama and a gothi. This seems to indicate that the kings in this period of Andhra were not absolute rulers with invincible powers, but were close to chiefdoms or, in Chattopadhyaya's word, 'localities' that derived possibly from the foundations of megalithic chiefs. These 'localities' seem to have consolidated their powers in close association with urban elites that also started appearing in this period."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_InDecKg][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The political and economic development in the post-Mauryan period progressed further under the Sadas, a regional dynasty which ruled the larger part of coastal Andhra for at least a century ... Although the historical evidence on this recently-found dynasty is still meagre, a few epigraphic records indicate the presence of a regular administrative structure indicated by titles such as an irrigation officer (?) (paniyagharika) and a scribe (lekhaka). There is also little doubt that the dynasty maintained royal coinage. Unlike the post-Mauryan coinage, which was basically uninscribed, the Sada coins were consistently inscribed with the ruler's name and kept the same design, a standing lion facing a tree ..."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_InDecKg]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious levels ♣ ♥</b> levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Buddhist monasteries.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_InDecKg]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Military levels ♣ ♥</b> levels.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Professions">Professions</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional military officers ♣ ♥</b> Full-time specialists</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional soldiers ♣ ♥</b> Full-time specialists</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional priesthood ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Buddhist monasteries.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_InDecKg]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bureaucracy_characteristics">Bureaucracy characteristics</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Full-time bureaucrats ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Full-time specialists[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Post-Mauryans in Krishna valley: "Amaravati inscription of this period records the existence of a royal scribe (rajalekhaka).
