Crete is divided into regional city-states which controlled a well defined region. The settlement hierarchy within these states is simple. It was centered upon the city where all the government, public and religious  buildings were located and villages and hamlets scatted throughout its rural countryside. City-states were independent of their neighbors and there was a political unity among the urban centre and the rural settlements.

Legal inscriptions, the oldest are dated to the 7th century BCE, were found so far in the city-states of Gortyn, Axos, and Dreros. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_GrCrArc] Many inscriptions were displayed on sanctuaries, a tangible expression of the intersection of law and religion. The texts are fragmentary and provide a very cloudy picture on the legal systems adopted by the Archaic city-states. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_GrCrArc] The codes primarily deal with issues of ownership and pledges. The most important inscription, the longest inscription of the Greek world, is the famous Gortyn Code or the Great Code. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_GrCrArc] Although the inscription is dated to the first half of the 5th century BCE, it is argued that echoes Archaic legislative systems.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Judges ♣present♥</b> The council of elders, the <i>Gerousia</i>, whose members were chosen among the best <i>Kosmoi</i>, had legislative and juridical authority.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_GrCrArc] Sound data indicates that the alphabet was first introduced and developed in Crete and not at Euboea, as some scholars had argued. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_GrCrArc] This theory has fully confirmed by the recent find of a Cretan inscription at Eltyna (Central Crete). [MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_GrCrArc] The Doric Cretan alphabet was very close to its Phoenician model. The Doric Cretan alphabet was also used to express an unknown language that is believed to be the language of the Minoans that was preserved and spoken by some groups in the isolated mountainous regions of east Crete. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_GrCrArc] These inscriptions date from the late 7th or early 6th century down to the 3rd century BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/></div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Kinds_of_Written_Documents">Kinds of Written Documents</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Lists, tables, and classifications ♣present♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Calendar ♣present♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Sacred Texts ♣present♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious literature ♣absent♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Practical literature ♣absent♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ History ♣absent♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Philosophy ♣absent♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Scientific literature ♣absent♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Fiction ♣absent♥</b><br/></div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Money">Money</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Articles ♣present♥</b>Minting in Greece was introduced around 6th century BCE.
