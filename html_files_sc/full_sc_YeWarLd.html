Sulayhids had conquered all of Yemen by 1063 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_YeWarLd][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In 1063 CE the Sulayhids had unified Yemen "within the extent of the pre-Islamic Himyarite state".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_YeWarLd][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Sulayhids: under al-Mukarram "the kingdom reached its maximum geographic extent and the apogee of its influence abroad."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_YeWarLd] Al-Mukarram extended the rule to Hadramaut.

At no time did the values and objectives of would-be rulers and of the population at large agree. Tribes, dynasties, and religious leaders nevertheless acted frequently, if intermittently, over most of Yemen's territory ... The ad hoc, evanescent coalitions formed are characteristic of a segmental pattern of authority, and thus of weakness of the political system as a whole. Some dynasties - the Sulayhids, the Zuray'ids, the Najab - succeeded in assembling substantial material resources, and were wealthy by the standards of the time; but they failed in the essential task of mobilizing the human energies needed to build and defend a viable Yemeni state. This consequent debility made Yemen an attractive target for foreign ambitions, and the country was in fact to become a family colony of the Ayyubids."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_YeWarLd]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ ♥</b> People.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ ♥</b> Inhabitants.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hierarchical_Complexity">Hierarchical Complexity</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ [3-5] ♥</b> levels.

The queen, however, relied on the Da'wa under Yahya ibn Lamak and its military arm, Sultan al-Khattab ibn al-Hasan al-Hamdani, the baron of Jurayb in the Hajur district. He is also called a da'j, for many works of the Yemeni da'wa were authored by him. He became the queen's defender of faith and the protector of her realm. He never attained the position of a Da'i mutlaq under the queen as a Hujja, which went to his mentor - the Da'i Dhu'ayb ibn Musa al-Wadi'i - on Da'i Yahya's death in 520/1126."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_YeWarLd][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Najahids: "Whether specimens of the 438 Rayy issue could have reached the Yemen by the following year, there to serve as models for the Najahid coinage, seems to me highly questionable, although there is evidence, architectural and epigraphic, to support the theory of a strong cultural link between Iran and the Yemen in the 11th century a.d. 17 What matters is that at this moment in history the title of Sultan could have been used only with reference to the head of state, the immediate deputy of the Caliph in the country of province concerned. At Zabid in 440 this authority was none other than Najah. The appearance of the title Sultan on coins 3 and 4 therefore reinforces the theory that coins of the ruler named al-Muzaffar must be Najahid, even if the name Najah does not figure on them."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_YeWarLd][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Even before al-Mukarram's death, the Fatimid court had sent a chief justice to Yemen, Lamak bin Malik, who remained in the office until his death in 1116; his son Yahya succeeded him for the remainder of Arwa's reign.
