"Contrary to other religions of the same type, such as the cults of Isis and Osiris, Serapis, Dionysus (all well-known examples), Mithraicism eschewed any external manifestations and depended only on its initiatory nature to recruit its followers. ... it gradually became a common faith for soldiers, civil servants, merchants ... The members joined a spirituality of an initiatory type ... shared with a large group of solar faiths ... that promised both a life near to the deity and a personal redemption."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_74_ItRomPr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"From the end of the first century B.C.E. we have evidence of a cult coming from the East and gradually and discretely conquering the Roman army and administration (Daniels). This god, previously unknown to the Romans, was called Mithra. Some historians believe (see Plutarch, Pomp. 24.7) that the notorius Cilician pirates defeated by Pompeius propagated this cult when deported in Calabria. We now believe that it was a late transformation of the god Mithra, the friendly protector of contracts .... and defender of true and just causes."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_75_ItRomPr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"We must also stress that this god retained, in his manifestation in the Roman Empire, his essential characteristics of friend and guardian of contracts."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_76_ItRomPr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Mithra probably won over even the imperial house. We are wary about the well-known initiation of the emperor Nero to the mysteries of the Magi through Tiridates (see Turcan 1989:237). However, it seems that the emperor Commodus (192) was an unworthy adept of the mysteries, because he was suspected of having killed a fellow-adept during a ceremony simulating a ritual sacrifice. The imperial house had a much worthier adept in Diocletian and his colleagues of the Tetrarchy: Galerius and Licinius. The god is then called the fautor imperii sui, the "protector of the imperial power" (Inscription of Carnuntum in 307)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_77_ItRomPr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Mithraism: "on the social level people learned, in the 'Persic Cavern', to respect the contract linking the human being to the cosmos and to the gods, and then, at least in an implicit way, to respect the emperors, who were divine beings, as intermediaries between the sky and the earth. The faithfulness to a vivifying cosmic order was thus accompanied by faithfulness to the one representing this order on earth. It is not surprising, then, that Mithra was invoked as Jupiter Dolichenus for the salvation of the emperor.

Tannenbaum (private communication) estimates a total of some 10,000-12,000 including Rome and Italy, but excluding the central and local adinistration of Egypt."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_108_ItRomPr]</i></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Examination system ♣ absent ♥</b> There was no examination system for the Roman bureaucracy.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Merit promotion ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Roman administration was typically formed out of a class of hereditary aristocrats. Distinctions between classes of legionary and distinctions between age and experience within the army had been eliminated by Marius in 105 BCE[MAJIDBENAM_REF_109_ItRomPr] and the Illyrian emperors demonstrate that "low born" individuals could make it to the top of the administrative hierarchy. Since there was no general policy of merit promotion in the Roman bureaucracy - and the promotion of low-born individuals to position of power might be considered a matter of "politics" among aristocrats - the code is inferred absent.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Specialized government buildings ♣ present ♥</b>  The first senate building, the Curia Hostilia, existed from about 600 BCE. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_110_ItRomPr] The first paving of the Roman Forum occurred around 575-625 BCE. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_111_ItRomPr] The first coin minted in Rome occurred about 269 BCE (one in Neapolis produced coins slightly earlier, around 281 BCE) and the first state archives was created in 78 BCE. Other buildings include: granaries and storehouses.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Buildings of the imperial bureaucracy, such as the Curia Julia. The Curia Julia was one of the main meeting places of the Roman Senate (later rebuilt under Diocletian after a fire in 283 CE). [MAJIDBENAM_REF_112_ItRomPr] The Senate also often met in appropriate temples.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_113_ItRomPr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The old Roman treasury - the aerarium Saturni - was for a time housed in the basement of the Temple of Saturn. There were lots of multi-purpose government buildings: basilicas, imperial fora, and porticos, which were utilized for government functions, such as official meetings or court hearings.Offices of local magistrates and town council buildings were housed in separate buildings. There were market buildings (the Markets of Trajan in Rome). Bathhouses proliferated. Other buildings include: granaries and storehouses, mints and state archives.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Law">Law</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Formal legal code ♣ present ♥</b> A formal legal code was first founded in the Twelve Tables of 450-449 BCE. Law thereafter was based on precedent. Our sources of knowledge of Roman law include the forensic speeches of Cicero; the Institutes of Gaius textbook (from 160 CE); and, much later, the sixth century CE Corpus Ius Civilis of Justinian. Wax tablets and papyri (contracts and wills etc.) also provide information on Roman law. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_114_ItRomPr] However, before this time restrictions on funerary extravagance, from the start of the 6th century, may suggest the Twelve Tables laws (of the Early Republic) codified an existing body of law and legal practices. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_115_ItRomPr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The constitutio Antoniniana of 212 CE brought an end to the distinction between civis and peregrius.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_116_ItRomPr] Social and legal distinctions were redrawn between honestiores (those with dignitas, public standing) and humiliores (those without). "Mandata" were directions from Emperor to provincial governors and state official.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_117_ItRomPr] The range of legal sanctions consisted was determined by social standing: aggravated execution, forced labour, beatings, and torture were reserved for slaves and humiliore), whereas fines and exile were more common for honestiores. The exception were for conspirators against an emperor who, despite their high standing, were often brutally tortured and executed. Long-term custodial imprisonment was unknown as a punishment.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Writing c200 CE "Papinian, perhaps the authority on law most respected in late antiquity, listed the sources of the ius civile as statutes (leges), popular resolutions (plebiscita), senatorial enactments (senatusconsulta), decrees of emperors (decreta principum) and the authoritative pronouncements of men learned in law, the jurists (auctoritas prudentium). To these was added the ius honorarium, the law contained in the Edict of the praetor, who, under the Republic and Early Empire administered law in Rome; this form of law derived its name from the praetor's magistracy (honos) and was held to 'assist, supplement or amend' the ius civile.".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_118_ItRomPr]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Judges ♣ absent ♥</b> Professional judges did not exist until the Roman Dominate although at that time their precise role vis-a-vis that of Imperial officials is a matter of debate. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_119_ItRomPr] Before this time there were no judges as a distinct profession in the Roman system of law. Local magistrates dealt with local matters, provincial governors dealt with provincial matters, and the praetors often dealt with cases in Rome. The Roman people could be duly convened as a final court of appeal in cases involving citizens.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Courts ♣ absent ♥</b>"The criminal law owed much to the reforms of two past lawgivers, the proto-emperor, L. Cornelius Sulla (dictator and consul, 81-80 BC), and the emperor Augustus. Sulla established a number of courts (quaestiones) to try various criminal offences, such as murder and poisoning (or use of charms), or forgery; in the statutes he would have defined the crime and the penalty. In other areas of criminal law, the framework supplied for later developments by the Leges Iuliae, the legislation of Augustus, predominates, with whole sections of the imperial law-codes devoted to imperial enactments relevant to the Julian laws on adulteries, corrupt solicitation (ambitus), extortion (repetundae), treason (maiestas) and on violence)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_120_ItRomPr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"As jury-courts fell out of use under the Early Empire, to be replaced by hearings before a single magistrate or judge, the courts established by the criminal statutes ceased to operate, but the statues themselves remained, as they specified offence and punishment. People prosecuted for murder, poisoning, or other relevant offences were still prosecuted under Sulla's law and liable to its penalties."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_121_ItRomPr] <i>Note (DH): the quaestiones were a sort of ad-hoc special tribunal - it refers to the section of law that the case was under, not an actual building, so 'court' is a bit of a stretch on the translation in the quote. Trials were still held basically wherever there was space -- bassilicae, fora, etc.</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]During the Roman Dominate administration of justice was "thoroughly bureaucratized" and "regular courts, special courts were established to deal with particular matters and categories of persons." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_122_ItRomPr] Before this time there was no specialised court building. Courts could be held in the basilicas[MAJIDBENAM_REF_123_ItRomPr] (introduced by the 3rd Century BCE[MAJIDBENAM_REF_124_ItRomPr]) where a provincial governor could an hold audience or in the Roman forum. Basilicas were multi-purpose buildings a place for banking and money-changing and town hall activities. The forum was a multi-purpose building which had existed since the Roman Kingdom.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional Lawyers ♣ present ♥</b> Law specialists first existed during the Principate when they commanded fees for their expertise. We know this because Emperor Claudius attempted to "limit the fees of advocates, which had become intolerably heavy" to protect "women and other helpless litigants from the rapacity of their lawyers." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_125_ItRomPr] The first law school in Rome, for persons who wished to pursue career in the Imperial civil service, was established late second century CE. "Professional" lawyers replaced orators during the Roman Dominate period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_126_ItRomPr]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Specialized_Buildings:_polity_owned">Specialized Buildings: polity owned</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ irrigation systems ♣ present ♥</b> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_127_ItRomPr] Improved irrigation, Cyrenaica.

For Egypt irrigation: Rathbone 2008; Blouin 2012</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ drinking water supply systems ♣ present ♥</b> At Rome nearly all aqueducts begin in Sabine Hills, in the valley of the river Anio. Waters, such as from the (previously built) Aqua Marcia, would take 15-20 hours to reach the city. At the city the water would enter a distribution tank, before travelling through the terracota or lead-pipe network. The best evidence for piped urban water networking has been found at Pompeii. The water had three main destinations: street fountains, baths and domestic. Most Romans gained their fresh water from street fountains. For domestic use, water supply was controlled by size of bronze nozzle (adjutage) that connected the masonry channel to the lead pipe that entered the house. Domestic water was probably paid for with a "water tax". [MAJIDBENAM_REF_129_ItRomPr] Arsinoe, metropolis in Egypt (capital town of a nome) "had running water supplied by two reservoirs into which water was pumped from an arm of the Nile." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_130_ItRomPr]  By the 3rd century CE, there were 11 aqueduct lines into Rome [MAJIDBENAM_REF_131_ItRomPr] which we can infer required maintenance. Under Claudius (41-54 CE) Aqua Claudius and Anio Novis were built with a gradient which fell several inches every 100 feet. Tunnels were precisely angled and key stone arch used for 6 mile column of arches that carried water into Rome. Waters were distributed to public drinking fountains, public baths and other buildings, and to wealthy Romans who paid for running water [MAJIDBENAM_REF_132_ItRomPr].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ markets ♣ present ♥</b> Trajan's market [MAJIDBENAM_REF_133_ItRomPr].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ food storage sites ♣ present ♥</b> A procurator for grain supply.
