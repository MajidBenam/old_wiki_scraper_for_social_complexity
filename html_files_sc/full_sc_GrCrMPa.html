Knossos is the largest urban center. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_GrCrMPa] The growth of the city during the Neopalatial period was followed by a considerable contraction after the end of Late Minoan IB (1450 BCE), and a dramatic decline after Late Minoan  IIIA (1300 BCE). The population is estimated to 25,000-30,000 inhabitants during 1500-1450 BCE, 10,000 inhabitants during 1450-1300 BCE, and just 1,000 inhabitants during 1300-1000 BCE.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hierarchical_Complexity">Hierarchical Complexity</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ [1-6] ♥</b> levels. Knossos was the main political, administrative and economic centre of the island.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_GrCrMPa] Villages, hamlets and farmhouses were scattered in the hinterland especially during the Late Minoan IIIA period.

Palatial institutions were seen as the only regulators of any economic transaction. Acting as redistributive agents, they were thought to draw upon raw materials and labour from the hinterland in order to produce and distribute specialized artisanal goods.  In recent years, however, new perspectives have effectively challenged not only the redistributive role of governing institutions but also the negative attitude towards the existence of market and market-like systems in the Aegean. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_GrCrMPa] Once people started looking for them, markets have begun to appear in much earlier chronological horizons, shaping the emergence of state administrative institutions. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_GrCrMPa] ( Garraty and Stark 2010). Although there are some constrains in recognizing and understanding markets in prehistoric societies, the market is an economic process which should developed further in Bronze Age Crete.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ food storage sites ♣present♥</b> e.g. the extensive public storerooms at Hagia Triada.
