Many of these became mamakuna, and they ran the aqllawasi cloisters and took care of sacred objects, shrines, and royal mummies.  There wasn’t much of a selection, training, and promotion for Inca men, but the aqllawasi did these things for Inca women. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_159_PeInca*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]No formalised procedure.Usually high officials (provincial governor level) had to be ethnic Inca, however there were exceptions.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_168_PeInca*]  Alan Covey: Inca law was largely divided between management of the Inca population of Cuzco (overseen by the Inca ruler), the maintenance of Inca interests in provincial areas (done by noble Inca inspectors and “confessors”), and the practice of local custom in provincial communities.  Low-level kurakas had limited power to punish serious crimes, which was done periodically by Inca governors.

Alan Covey: The Quechua title apu means “lord,” but also “judge.”  There was also an official called an huchukamayuq who dealt with offenses against Inca majesty in the provinces.  These were not necessarily full-time or bureaucratic appointments. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_172_PeInca*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]On provincial governors (tokrikoq): "He also judged all the cases that were related to state interests and had the authority to pass sentences up to and including the death penalty (Cobo 1979: 194-202; Moore 1958: 115)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_173_PeInca*] . It seems that being a judge was only one of his many functions.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Further aspects of law emphasized the cleavages of status found in Inca society (Moore 1958: 74-5). In general, any individual in the state hierarchy could be judged only by someone of higher rank." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_174_PeInca*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Inspectors and JudgesCuzco also appointed a centrally controlled set of inspectors (tokoyrikoq, “He Who Sees All”) who checked on affairs in the provinces. Diez de Betanzos (1996: 110-11) wrote that the sons of the ruler were charged with the inquiries. The highest-ranking official may have been the “Inspector General” of the conquered territories, a position that was sometimes filled by the emperor’s brother. The existence of these independent agents implies that the rulers evidently did not fully trust the provincial officials to conduct all affairs with the best interests of the Sapa Inca and the state in mind."

In Ollantaytambo: "Canals running through the streets provided fresh water and may have carried away effluent." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_181_PeInca*] Alan Covey: There’s no reference to a formal system of drinking water being brought to Cuzco (the way that Roman aqueducts fed basins and fountains).  More likely that local springs provided water.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_184_PeInca*] “We have no accounts of large marketplaces, few descriptions of independent traders except on the margins of the empire […] yet in spite of this, evidence for small marketplaces exists in the pre-Hispanic Central Andes. Local fairs flourished, and there was a brisk trade in many goods, both basic commodities and products of highly specialized labor.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_185_PeInca*] “The historical data are quite clear that there were few price-making markets, but substantial barter markets, in the Andes.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_186_PeInca*] “We contend that barter fairs were the means by which most commodities were traded in the Andes prior to and even during the Inca Empire. There was without doubt a state imperial economy that produced and moved large quantities of goods outside of any barter or other kind of market. But at the daily, domestic level, people most likely produced and traded goods, at least locally, if not regionally, outside of the state economy.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_187_PeInca*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ food storage sites ♣ present ♥</b>  "Thousands of storage units were built on the hills surrounding the Inca provincial centers ...
