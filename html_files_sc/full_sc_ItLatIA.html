However, it is possible that Osteria dell'Osa was not a unitary settlement, but a cluster of small villages.

There is a lot of evidence for the existence of elites throughout the chronological sequence [MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_ItLatIA][MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_ItLatIA].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Most of the burials at Castel di Decima (LC III and IV) are quite simple inhumations, with no or modest grave goods, but a minority of graves are accompanied by high-quality goods such as amber beads, gold fibulae, and even chariots. The wealth of this minority appears to increase throughout the 8th and 7th centuries.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_ItLatIA]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious levels ♣ 1 ♥</b> levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1.

However, there is no indication of differences, among these warriors, in terms of rank.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Professions">Professions</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional military officers ♣ absent ♥</b>  The highest officers in the Roman military system were not professionals.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional soldiers ♣ absent ♥</b> Not until 406 BCE did "Romans introduce pay for military service." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_ItLatIA] This is the earliest possible start date for professional soldiers.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional priesthood ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Early Roman cults were funded by regular public offerings, large individual donations, and payment for services. The hierarchy could also profit from land ownership. Professionalism of the priesthood likely pre-dates the Roman era as similar patterns are evident in Greek and Egyptian civilization. When the state provided gifts, it was often in the form of a lavish construction, such as a new temple. Examples: priests of Isis were "full-time religious professionals" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_ItLatIA][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The cremated remains of what appears to have been a ritual specialist at Osteria dell'Osa have been found, accompanied by a small figurine depicting a human making an offering, as well as a miniaturised sacrificial knife, a ritually broken pot and miniaturised vessels of the kind that were used to make ritual offerings [MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_ItLatIA]. However, it may be excessive to leap to the conclusion that there was a "professional priesthood".</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bureaucracy_characteristics">Bureaucracy characteristics</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Full-time bureaucrats ♣ absent ♥</b> During the Roman Principate there were salaried officials who worked in the Imperial Bureaux (scrinia) [MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_ItLatIA] but before this time any bureaucrats that existed are thought to have been unpaid aristocrats.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Examination system ♣ absent ♥</b> There was no examination system.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Merit promotion ♣ absent ♥</b> Roman administration was typically formed out of a class of hereditary aristocrats. Within the army, distinctions between classes of legionary and distinctions between age and experience were not eliminated until Marius in 105 BCE. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_ItLatIA]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Specialized government buildings ♣ absent ♥</b>  The first senate building, the Curia Hostilia, existed from about 600 BCE. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_ItLatIA] The first paving of the Roman Forum occurred around 575-625 BCE. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_ItLatIA] The first coin minted in Rome occurred about 269 BCE (one in Neapolis produced coins slightly earlier, around 281 BCE) and the first state archives was created in 78 BCE. Other possible buildings include: granaries and storehouses.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Law">Law</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Formal legal code ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> A formal legal code was first founded in the Twelve Tables of 450-449 BCE. Law thereafter was based on precedent. Our sources of knowledge of Roman law include the forensic speeches of Cicero; the Institutes of Gaius textbook (from 160 CE); and, much later, the sixth century CE Corpus Ius Civilis of Justinian. Wax tablets and papyri (contracts and wills etc.) also provide information on Roman law. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_ItLatIA] However, before this time restrictions on funerary extravagance, from the start of the 6th century, may suggest the Twelve Tables laws (of the Early Republic) codified an existing body of law and legal practices. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_ItLatIA]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Judges ♣ absent ♥</b> Professional judges did not exist until the Roman Dominate although at that time their precise role vis-a-vis that of Imperial officials is a matter of debate. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_ItLatIA] Before this time there were no judges as a distinct profession in the Roman system of law. Local magistrates dealt with local matters, provincial governors dealt with provincial matters, and the praetors often dealt with cases in Rome. The Roman people could be duly convened as a final court of appeal in cases involving citizens.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Courts ♣ absent ♥</b> During the Roman Dominate administration of justice was "thoroughly bureaucratized" and "regular courts, special courts were established to deal with particular matters and categories of persons." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_ItLatIA] Before this time there was no specialised court building. Courts could be held in the basilicas[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_ItLatIA] (introduced by the 3rd Century BCE[MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_ItLatIA]) where a provincial governor could an hold audience or in the Roman forum. Basilicas were multi-purpose buildings a place for banking and money-changing and town hall activities. The forum was a multi-purpose building which had existed since the Roman Kingdom.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional Lawyers ♣ absent ♥</b> Law specialists first existed during the Principate when they commanded fees for their expertise. We know this because Emperor Claudius attempted to "limit the fees of advocates, which had become intolerably heavy" to protect "women and other helpless litigants from the rapacity of their lawyers." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_ItLatIA] The first law school in Rome, for persons who wished to pursue career in the Imperial civil service, was established late second century CE. "Professional" lawyers replaced orators during the Roman Dominate period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_ItLatIA]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Specialized_Buildings:_polity_owned">Specialized Buildings: polity owned</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ irrigation systems ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> Possibly unnecessary within Italy at this time due to sufficient rainfall.

Earlier the old Forum Boarium and Forum Holitorium in the centre of Rome seem to have coped with the main flow of imports which had probably come down the Tiber from the Italian hills."

The Via Salaria, “salt road,”  and the Sacra Via in Rome, were in existence from the beginning of the Roman Kingdom. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_ItLatIA] The first paved road was the probably the Appian Way which dates to 312 BCE. In about 450 BCE the laws of the Twelve Tables, dated to approximately 450 BCE, issued regulations for the dimensions of roads. So at least from 450 BCE the pre-paved roads had maintenance work done of them. Due to the importance of the "salt road", however, it is likely this mud track had maintenance work during the Roman Kingdom.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Bridges ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> The first bridge thought to be the Pons Sublicius possibly in built 642 BCE under Ancus Marcius.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Canals ♣ absent ♥</b> The first canal is thought to have been built by Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (consul 187 BCE) to drain the lower Po region.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ports ♣  ♥</b> unknown. There was a port known as Caere 50km north west of Rome during the Roman Kingdom. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_42_ItLatIA] A port is thought to have been built under Ancus Marcius.
