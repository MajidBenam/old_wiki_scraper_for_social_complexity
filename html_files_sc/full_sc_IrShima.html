Kutscher suggested that Ziringu, named as the paramount ruler of Zabshali in one of the Shu-Sin texts, ruled a Shimaskian 'empire' comprised of a 'confederacy of lands whose leading force was the land of Zabshali' (Kutscher 1989: 100)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_IrShima][MAJIDBENAM_BR]_Palatial government_[MAJIDBENAM_BR]2.

Later, another goddess, Kirrisha, surpassed her, but many goddesses were gradually demoted and replaced in rank by male gods. Yet Kirrisha never lost her title as the main goddess of Elam, and it is significant for later developments that she married two of her brothers who were major gods.
