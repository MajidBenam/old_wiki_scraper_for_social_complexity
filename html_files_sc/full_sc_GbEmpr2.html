In less important places the top officials were called administrators or commissioners. "The governors were appointed by the monarch (particularly in the early days of the Empire), by proprietors (in the case of proprietary colonies), or by the government and their duties varied considerably, some ruling as autocrats, others (especially as colonies moved toward independence) leaving most decision making to legislative councils composed of local residents. The monarch's representative in those British Overseas Territories that have a permanent population also holds the title of 'governor' and carries out the duties of head of state. Moreover, the British monarch is also - and independently - head of state of Australia and of Canada, appointed representatives to each state in the former and to each province in the latter. In Australia, these individuals are known as governors and in Canada as lieutenant-governors"."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_GbEmpr2]</li><li>1784 CE: "Parliament approves the India Act, which gives the government direct control over the political activities of the East India Company."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_GbEmpr2]</li><li>"colonial self-reliance operating through representative Assemblies had been adopted for Nova Scotia (1758), Prince Edward Island (1773), and New Brunswick (1784), and after 1791 the Canadas, though the powers of Governors and executives were nominally strengthened in the light of the American experience. In the conquered, ceded, and later settled colonies, however, more authoritarian regimes were established, involving Governors working initially with advisory Councils and then with nominated Executive and Legislative Councils, the latter pattern coming to be known as Crown Colony government."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_GbEmpr2] After Canadian rebellion "political advance was sought through the Union of 1841 and a subsequent devolution of authority which facilitated local self-government operating under Cabinet conventions known as responsible government. Colonial politicians, enjoying the legitimacy of popular consent for their exercise of executive power, now provided acceptable collaborators who could be left to their own devices in matters of internal administration."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_GbEmpr2] "maturing communities would normally pass, at different speeds according to different circumstances, from Crown Colony status to full self-government."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_42_GbEmpr2] During 1830s CE "in Crown Colonies outside British North America, the Governor's advisory council was replaced by nominated Executive and Legislative Councils in Western Australia, the Cape, Trinidad, Mauritius, and Ceylon, thus bringing them in line with New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land (1825)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_43_GbEmpr2] "Once British North America had forced open the gateway to self-government, Australians and New Zealanders were able to make a final dash for local autonomy, securing both representative institutions and responsible government in virtually one leap between 1850 and 1856. They then set about making local sovereignty a reality by eroding residual Imperial authority - Crown lands, fiscal and commercial policy, and internal securtiy - and by forging the political frameworks of the nations they were in the process of building."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_44_GbEmpr2] 1865 CE islands in the West Indies starting with Jamaica abandoned "legislative independence in exchange for the security of direct government by the British Crown."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_45_GbEmpr2]</li><li>Late 19th century many Protectorates created.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_46_GbEmpr2] "Protectorates came to be administered as if they were colonies - and some were indeed redesignated as such - trends symbolized by the transfer of the Foreign Office's responsibilities to the Colonial OFfice between 1898 and 1905."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_47_GbEmpr2] "By the 1890s, without the formality of annexation, the British authorities and local agents were freely establishing in Protectorates rudimentary frameworks of government involving courts, taxation, military 'pacification', displacement of indigenous rulers, and the issue of certificates for land titles which paved the way for Crown land rights and appropriation by European settlers."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_48_GbEmpr2]</li><li>1783-1870 CE: British government largely non-interventionist due to "the physical difficulties of communicating" and "partly from a lack of a strong bureaucracy". "Authority in Britain was divided between different bodies. Effectively from about 1812, a Colonial Office in Whitehall was responsible for the colonies. This was headed by a minister who became Colonial Secretary. ... For the most part it saw its function as responding to developments overseas rather than initiating new policies. India was always a separate concern. Until 1858 the British government did not exercise direct authority over it. Detailed administration was left to the old East India Company, subject to the supervision of a government department on major issues of policy. The administration both of India and of the colonies was responsible to Parliament."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_49_GbEmpr2]</li><li>"Early British rule was very Indian in character. Once the British had succeeded in taking over an Indian state, they had neither the capacity nor the inclination to introduce radical changes in the way that it was run."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_50_GbEmpr2]</li><li>"An early administrative respect and tolerance for what were understood to be traditional Indian customs, laws, and religion were subsequently somewhat modified by calls from assorted utilitarians, liberal reformers, and evangelicals for the wholesale Anglicization of society. After the shock of the Indian Mutiny in 1857, however, enthusiasm for rapid Westernization was officially replaced by a deliberate distancing of British authority from the regenderation of Indian society and by a more pronounced insistence on Indian 'difference'."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_51_GbEmpr2]</li><li>British administrators "pragmatically sought accommodation with indigenous and emigrant societies"  and while there were some powerful personalities the execution of British rule "was pursued chiefly through mediation with indigenous elites or collaborating groups possessing local influence".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_52_GbEmpr2]</li><li>After 1857 CE "India's princes, as rulers of quasi-independent states, were thus integrated into the Imperial order with a recognized status and special privileges.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_53_GbEmpr2]</li></ul><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious levels ♣ ♥</b> levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"In certain circumstances, commercial organizations and missionary societies could embody and uphold Imperial authority."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_54_GbEmpr2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Military levels ♣ 11 ♥</b> levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1.

It entailed drastically reshaping landscapes in the hinterlands of cities by damming rivers, raising lakes, or flooding valleys and then piping water under pressure to sometimes distant cities; it also, promoters hoped, would reform urban environments and societies at the same time. Between 1840 and the end of the century, engineers in Britain executed it approximately one hundred times, but the gravitation scheme had a life beyond the bounds of Britain. In the second half of the nineteenth century, engineers—usually the very same individuals who had carried them out in Britain— introduced the scheme to cities such as Bombay, Colombo, Hong Kong, and Singapore. There, the gravitation scheme also had a transformative influence; it was a project of environmental and technical change that helped to solidify the modernizing colonial state.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_67_GbEmpr2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ markets ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ food storage sites ♣ present ♥</b></div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Transport_infrastructure">Transport infrastructure</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Roads ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Bridges ♣ present ♥</b> Isambard Kingdom Brunel engineered many bridges.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Canals ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ports ♣ present ♥</b></div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Special_purpose_sites">Special purpose sites</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Mines or quarries ♣ present ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Information">Information</span></h3><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Writing_System">Writing System</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Mnemonic devices ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Nonwritten records ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Written records ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Script ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Non-phonetic writing ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Phonetic alphabetic writing ♣ present ♥</b></div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Kinds_of_Written_Documents">Kinds of Written Documents</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Lists, tables, and classifications ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Calendar ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Sacred Texts ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious literature ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Practical literature ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ History ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Philosophy ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Scientific literature ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Fiction ♣ present ♥</b></div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Money">Money</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Articles ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Tokens ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Precious metals ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Foreign coins ♣ present ♥</b> "Before the early nineteenth century the Royal Mint's role was largely domestic.

The installation of Boulton's steam-powered machinery, coupled with a French invention, the 'reducing machine', which reproduced original coin designs by machine rather than by hand engraving, enabled for the first time the mass production of high-quality and homogenous copper coins and transformed the Mint itself into an 'industrial concern'.
