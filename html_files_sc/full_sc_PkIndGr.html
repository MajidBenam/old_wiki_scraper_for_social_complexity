Strabo, quoting  Apollodorus of Artemita, states that the Indo-Greek territory, "took possession, not only of Patalena, but also, on the rest of the coast, of what is called the kingdom of Saraostus and Sigerdis"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_PkIndGr] (the provinces of Sindh and possibly Gujarat). However, "with archaeological methods, the Indo-Greek territory can however only be confirmed from the Kabul Valley to the eastern Punjab, so Greek presence outside was probably short-lived or less significant". [MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_PkIndGr] And Dr Tarn, "pleads for literal Greek rule over country extending from Kabul in a straight line nine hundred miles south to Broach...He speaks of the coastal provinces south of Patalene (Indus Delta) remaining Greek".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_PkIndGr] This would include the Kachi Plain but no dates are provided.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ 60,000 ♥</b> people.

If this one example typified the situation in the Indo-Greek Kingdom, the Greek polis was the administrative, ritualized, and  monumental heartland of the territory, but not the dominant population centre and represented a new construction. Below this newly urban space were the existing infrastructure of towns and villages. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_PkIndGr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]1.

Below this level, the hyparchy was a subdivision. Below this level, the direct supporters of the ruler were the 'friends'based on favor or eunoia. The power was further strengthened by vast land holding, villages, slaves and other wealth. Below this level was the topoi and overseen by dioikites or oikonomos.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_PkIndGr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Seleucid Empire did have full time bureaucrats, and this system in the Greco-Bactrians also seems to have existed.
