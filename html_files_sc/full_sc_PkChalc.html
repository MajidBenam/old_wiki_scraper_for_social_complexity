Enault and the study of the surface remains show that the typical pottery of Period III extends well beyond the limits of MR.2 to the north and to the south. In fact, this pottery covers about 75 hectares (about 180 acres). Even if we admit the existence of several phases and possible shifts of the settlement, such an area continuously covered by a characterisfic ware decorated with caprids, birds, and geometric motifs indicates that a large number of people occupied the site in the fourth millennium B.C."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_PkChalc] Assuming 50 inhabitants per hectare, and that between 25 and 75 hectares were occupied at any given time, this site might have been inhabited by about 1,200-3,700 people. A previous, much larger estimate, of 3,000-12,000, and based on 50-200 inhabitants per hectare, and about 60 hectares, was deemed excessive[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_PkChalc].</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hierarchical_Complexity">Hierarchical Complexity</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ 2 ♥</b> levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1.
