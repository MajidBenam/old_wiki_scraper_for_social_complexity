[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_FrTeneC][MAJIDBENAM_BR][MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_FrTeneC][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In Central Gaul, there were even bigger political units. They might have had 4 tiers, and a scale going over 20,000 sq kilometers. These political units are the ones that Caesar called civitates. "En Gaule centrale, existaient des entités politiques plus vastes encore. Celles-ci semblent bien avoir possédé quatre niveaux d'intégration avec une échelle dépassant Ies 20 000 km2. Ces entités politiques sont celles que César a nommées civitates."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_FrTeneC] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_FrTeneC] Caesar might have been prone to exaggeration.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Some idea for scale of tribal populations comes from Caesar at the time of his invasion of Gaul. Helvetii, Tulingi, Latobrigi, Rauraci and Boii wanted to move from Switzerland to South West Gaul. According to Caesar (c50 BCE) there were 368,000 in total.
