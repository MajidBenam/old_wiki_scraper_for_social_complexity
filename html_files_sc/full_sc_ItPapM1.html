[MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_ItPapM1] We don't know where this increase occurred although we do estimate that the population of Rome "boomed" in the 16th Century. However, this could be rebound after the depopulation that followed the sack of Rome 1527 CE, and may not represent a demographic trend as such. Even so, it was an impressive recovery despite the famines and plagues. We could use the figure again for this period as a rough guess.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ 10,000: 1527 CE; 45,000: 1550 CE; 116,695: 1591 CE; 99,312: 1602 CE ♥</b> Figures are for Rome; although the population shrank to around 10,000 following the sack of 1527, it quickly recovered to be the largest city in the Papal States.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_ItPapM1] Black notes that Bologna's population in 1581 was around 70,661, however, making it possibly larger than Rome for a brief period between the 1550s and 1591.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_ItPapM1]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hierarchical_Complexity">Hierarchical Complexity</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ 4 ♥</b> levels. The papal palace complexes within Rome; Rome; large provincial cities (Bologna, Ancona); towns; villages[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Papal palace complexes: The papal palaces in Rome-especially the Lateran and the Vatican-contained increasingly large bureaucracies.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1. Rome: The largest city of the Papal States; although the 1527 sack reduced the population, the city quickly recovered.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]2. Large provincial cities: Bologna, Ancona, Ferrara.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div>3. Towns: Provincial centers such as Perugia served as administrative centers for provincial government.</div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div><div>4. Villages: Market towns such as Norcia.</div></div></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Administrative levels ♣ [4-5] ♥</b> Pope; Cardinals and legates; rectors, counts, and dukes; the papal curia; garrison commanders, village leaders, and provincial officials[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1. Pope: The pope remained the head of a vast bureaucracy and leader of the papal state, and by the late sixteenth century his authority was rarely directly challenged in the Papal State.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]2. Cardinals and legates:  The cardinalate was a fundamental part of the administration and politics of the Papal State. Legates-often, themselves, cardinals-handled diplomatic business outside of the papal states. The cardinals' palaces in Rome were in effect sub-headquarters of the papal bureaucracy.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div>3. Rectors, counts, governors: These were the clerical officials sent out by the papacy to the provinces of the Papal State..</div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div>3. The curia: The papal bureaucracy was a massive, complex machine founded on bribery, the sale of offices, and patronage politics. The sale of offices within the curia had long been routinized, but following the Council of Trent (1545-1563), the Counter-Reformation began curtailing the nepotism and corruption that characterized the Renaissance-era papacy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_ItPapM1]</div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div><div>4. Garrison commanders, village leaders: I use this category to denote minor officials in the provinces of the papal states, who often were appointed locally; the unit of territory would be the parish, which remained the basic unit of religious and administrative organization in the Papal State until at least the Napoleonic invasions, and in many ways beyond.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_ItPapM1]</div></div></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious levels ♣ 6 ♥</b> levels.

Pope: The undisputed head of the Roman Catholic Church, and <i>pontifex maximus</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]2. Cardinals: Since the Middle Ages, they had assumed ever-greater powers in the Church, electing popes, overseeing dioceses in some cases, and handling theological disputes[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div>3. Archbishops: Overseers of suffragan bishoprics; some archbishops were cardinals</div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div><div>4. Bishops, abbots, directors of the religious orders: Bishops of individual dioceses (such as the bishop of Lucca); abbots, heads of abbeys; directors of the religious orders: The leaders of orders such as the Jesuits, Carmelites, and Franciscans.</div></div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div><div><div>5.

Pope; cardinals and other officials appointed by the popes to command armies; unit commanders; rank and file troops[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1. Pope: The pope was still the overall commander of papal armies, and Julius II (1503-1513) was notorious for taking the field with his troops like a secular military leader.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]2. Cardinals and other appointees: Papal troops were often part of wider coalitions during this period (such as the Holy League of 1570-71), and so were under the command of Spanish or Austrian Habsburg commanders.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div>3. Mercenary commanders: The great age of the <i>condottieri</i> was over, and so this level should, perhaps, be bracketed as equivalent to "other appointees."</div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div><div>4. Unit commanders: commanders of infantry regiments, artillery units, and so fort.</div></div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div><div><div>5. Rank and file troops: The papacy maintained garrisons in the Papal State, especially in fortress towns such as Loreto (a fortified shrine on the Adriatic, and often threatened by Turkish squadrons). In addition, Spanish troops often supported the Papacy or did the fighting for the popes.</div></div></div></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Professions">Professions</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional military officers ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional soldiers ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional priesthood ♣ present ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bureaucracy_characteristics">Bureaucracy characteristics</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Full-time bureaucrats ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Examination system ♣ absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Merit promotion ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> there is no indication that there were regular, institutionalized procedures for promotion based on performance.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Specialized government buildings ♣ present ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Law">Law</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Formal legal code ♣ present ♥</b> As in earlier periods, the Papal States possessed foundational legal texts in the form of the <i>Codex Iustinianus</i>, canon law, papal bulls, and the various constitutions and edicts that governed individual territories' relationship with the papacy as a central power.
