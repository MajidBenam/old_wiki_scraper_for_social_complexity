"'Athtar almost always occupies first place in lists and his cult was spread throughout the region."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_79_YeHmyr1] Different polities/people had their own god. "The patron deity (shym) of a people was of more immediate significance in south Arabia than the remoter figure of 'Athtar. The four principal peoples had as their patrons Almaqah (Sabaeans), Wadd (Minaeans), 'Amm (Qatabanians) and Sayin (Hadramites), and each people was collectively termed the 'chrildren of their respective patron deity."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_80_YeHmyr1] The pagan religion of South Arabia "was in its essence a planetary astral system in which the cult of the moon-god prevailed. The moon, known in Hadramawt as Sin, to the Minaeans as Wadd (love or lover, father), to the Sabaeans as Almaqah (the health-giving god?) and to the Qatabanians as 'Amm (paternal uncle), stood at the head of the pantheon. He was conceived of as a masculine deity and took precedence over the sun, Shams, who was his consort. 'Athtar (Venus, corresponding to the Babylonian goddess Ishtar, Phoenician 'Ashtart), their son, was the third member of the triad. From this celestial pair sprang the many other heavenly bodies considered divine."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_81_YeHmyr1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The pagan Himyarites likely worshipped Almaqah from the time the kingdom was combined with Saba. Hitti writes that the "Himyarites were close kinsmen of the Sabaeans and, as the youngest branch of the sock, became the inheritors of the Minaeo-Sabaean culture and trade."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_82_YeHmyr1] The Himyarites worshipped Almaqah, 'Athtar and other deities.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_83_YeHmyr1] Philostorgius said of the Himyarites: 'They sacrifice to the sun and moon and spirits of the land.'"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_84_YeHmyr1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The pagan Himyarites practiced dedications to temples[MAJIDBENAM_REF_85_YeHmyr1] which were likely sufficiently complex to archive papyrus legal statements concerning the usage of tombs.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_86_YeHmyr1] Minaean carvings in the temple ruins of al-Hazm, from the first millennium BCE, suggest dancing girls may have been included among the temple servants.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_87_YeHmyr1] Sabaean temples are known to have received tithes at the federal and local levels and its financing may been the "divine assistance" behind construction projects. "Some Middle 'Sabaean' temples may have acted as 'insurance companies' ... Hence the presence of some kind of insurance company which would provide assistance (to build, say, a house after it had been destroyed) was really very practical and useful for most clans. By paying their tithe ('s2r) to the local temples, the tribesmen paid a sort of 'premium' to this insurance company', whereby they could expect to get their 'compensation' when they needed it."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_88_YeHmyr1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The religion of the Himyarites was pagan and polytheistic in the period 270-375 CE and Jewish or Judaistic monotheism in the period 375-525 CE when they "fell under the influence of Jewish proselytizers"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_89_YeHmyr1] and by the late 4th century CE were rapidly converting from their pagan polytheistic belief system to monotheistic religious doctrines.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_90_YeHmyr1] "There is significant archaeological evidence of the abandonment of pagan temples toward the conclusion of the fourth century and of the almost complete disappearance of expressions of devotion to the old tribal gods shortly thereafter."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_91_YeHmyr1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]_Pagan_[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1.

Before the first century AD the title of qayn occurs very frequently, relating the holder to a deity ... ruler ... city ... or clan ... and usually concerning the supervision of construction projects. After this time the term only appears as the name of a clan (perhaps because such administrators were originally drawn exclusively from thsi clan), and we hear much more of maqtawis, personal assistants. They are most often encountered on military campaigns ... but also performed secretarial duties, supervised building works ... and the like.
