The Ubaid reached its greatest extent probably during Ubaid 3 or Ubaid 4 phase and it encompasses regions as follows: southern Mesopotamia ('heartland'), central Mesopotamia, northern Mesopotamia, northwestern Syria, southeastern Anatolia, western Iran and the western littoral of the Persian Gulf.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_IqUbaid]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> People. The researchers deeply believed that the north Ubaid was more populated than southern regions of Ubaid.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_IqUbaid], [MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_IqUbaid] There are known some calculation regarding the size of populations inhabited some particular sites such as Tell al-Hawa (1500-4000 people, area of the site - 15-20 ha), Site 118 (500-1200 people; area of the site- 5-6 ha) and Khanijdal East (100-200 people, area of the site- 1ha). There are based on a range of on-site population densities of 100 to 200 people per ha. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_IqUbaid]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ [750-1250] ♥</b> Inhabitants. Adams (1981) estimates that the Ubaid populations at Uruk and other large settlements ~1000 in the early Ubaid and ranged from 2000-3000 in the Middle/Late Ubaid. Perhaps 1000-3000 would be a good range to capture the whole period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_IqUbaid] NOTE: pers. comm. with Selin Nugent, but could not find exact page reference. </div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hierarchical_Complexity">Hierarchical Complexity</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ 2 ♥</b> levels. The analysis of settlement pattern confirmed the existence of two-tiered settlement system, which consist of few smaller hamlets or villages (ar. 1 ha) neighbouring the central bigger village. However there is possible to notice some differences between southern and northern regions of the Ubaid. In the northern regions the central villages were bigger (even 10-12 ha) and probably denser populated comparing to the southern regions such as e. g. the Hamrin. Stein believed that the settlement system in the northern Ubaid was even more complex, but there is impossible to establish the exact levels of complexity. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_IqUbaid], [MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_IqUbaid]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Administrative levels ♣ 2 ♥</b> levels.The researchers assumed that the more complex level of social and administrative organization must have existed in the Ubaid. The differences in size and form of houses in the villages as well as their equipment, use of various type of stamp seals and erecting monumental temples suggest the higher level of social organization and system of social and political control and appearance of elite group, probably related at least partially to ceremonial structures and controlling the surplus of food. However, there is almost completely lack of any prestige or luxury or exotic goods which will support the hypothesis of social stratification among the Ubaid community.  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_IqUbaid]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious levels ♣ ♥</b> levels. There is not any direct evidence concerning the religious complexity. There were found remains of many temples as well as houses which also might have been used in rituals, but there is impossible to establish any hierarchic levels of ritual activity or places and shows religious centre dedicated for few villages or for whole region.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Military levels ♣ ♥</b> levels.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Professions">Professions</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional military officers ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> There is no information regarding the presence of any army or soldiers, etc. in the Ubaid.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional soldiers ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> There is no information regarding the presence of any army or soldiers, etc. in the Ubaid.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional priesthood ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b>  It seems that the beginning of forming the elite dedicated to religious practices has started in the Ubaid period, however there is impossible to say whether they have been already full-time specialists or rather semi-time priest which were also responsible for many other work. Probably, the existence of elite in Ubaid is strongly connected with religious and the temples. However, there are know depictions of 'priests' (so called 'namash') on the seals from Tepe Gawra (level XIII and level XII - Late Ubaid) and Susa, but their interpretation is highly subjective.

The latest level (1) is especially interesting for its evidence of a community water supply. Remains of a lengthy system of terracotta water pipes was traced over half a kilometer to the north, leading apparently from a large wadi to a stone - lined basin (2.5 × 1.5 meters and c.1 meter deep).
