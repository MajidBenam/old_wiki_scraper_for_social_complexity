They were, however, not all occupied at the same time. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_PkCeraN]. The total number of sites known is 33.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_PkCeraN] Mehrgarh I - II inter-regional styles of wheel-made pottery [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_PkCeraN]: the living area grew from 2ha to 12 ha.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> It is not possible to make an accurate estimate.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_PkCeraN]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ [400-600] ♥</b> The size of occupied Mehrgarh is uncertain, as the population shifted over time and part of the site has been cut away by the Bolan River.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_PkCeraN]. A. Ceccarelli [MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_PkCeraN] confirms that it is not easy to estimate the population of Mehrgarh at this time because it is not clear how much of the site was inhabited at any given moment. As for burial data, "we do not yet know to what degree the excavated area may represent the whole graveyard and to what extent the burials reflect the actualliving population." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_PkCeraN] However, "The total area is likely ta be at least twelve hectares, however, including that which has been washed away by the Balan River. Such an expanse of cultural remains is difficult ta interpret until it is made clear that these deposits, in fact, do not represent the remains a permanent senlement. Only in the central part the senlement are superimposed architectural remains visible in the section cut by the Balan River and in the sections exposed in the soundings."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_PkCeraN] If we assume that between 4 and 12 hectares were occupied at any one time, and that there were about 50 inhabitants per hectare, then perhaps the site was inhabited by between 400 and 600 inhabitants.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hierarchical_Complexity">Hierarchical Complexity</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣[1-2] ♥</b> levels.

The excavators think that this does not imply that we can reconstruct the social stratigraphy that would be associated with an archaic state, but some internal differentiation of the Stage Two society is possible, in view of the sophistication of craft production documented at Mehrgarh.”[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_PkCeraN]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious levels ♣ 1 ♥</b> levels. Clay figurines have been found but there is no evidence for a religious hierarchy at Mehrgarh.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_PkCeraN] “At Mehrgarh human figurines are miniature works of art in clay. The earliest human figurines in Periods I are seated or standing and schematically represented. They were formed from a single piece of clay, with minimal representation of arms and legs; a few were adorned with necklaces and belts applied to the basic figure. Some were decorated with red ochre. In general, they range in size from 1.5 to 10 centimeters. Many of the figurines have feminine characteristics - realistic breasts; one standing figure bears the hint of genitalia and is obviously male (Jarrige 2005: 30-31).  Catherine Jarrige (1991, 2005) conducted extensive study of the Mehrgarh figurines. As she points out, their frequent presence in trash deposits gives the impression they were discarded haphazardly. However, there are several clues that may lead to an understanding of their significance to the people at Mehrgarh. One is reflected in the locations of trash deposits. Since many of the deposits are found in household areas, they may represent a domestic cult, perhaps associated with “representations of tutelary deities for the family, the clan or a relevant profession” (Jarrige 1991: 92). Another possibility is their use for magical practices, as is frequently the case in agrarian societies (Jarrige 1991: 92).  The recent discovery of one of the pierced human figurines in a grave from Period I, in which the figurine was held to the dead woman’s face in clasped hands, may indicate something about the role she played in society (Jarrige 2005: 34).</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Military levels ♣ 1 ♥</b> levels.
