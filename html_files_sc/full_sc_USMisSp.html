Most people lived in these nucleated villages, each of which was occupied by at least a few tens of people, and sometimes several times that number. Only a small proportion of the valley's inhabitants lived in houses that were widely separated from one another."  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_USMisSp][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"It has been argued that villages with well over a hundred buildings had developed by the late Emergent Mississippian period." However "it is equally possible that the feature patterns represent nothing more than multiple super-imposed, short-term occupations that cannot be teased apart." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_USMisSp][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Houses organized around a courtyard[MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the Emergent Mississippian "The community pattern usually included organized groupings of houses and other structures arranged around a courtyard, often with a central post that was sometimes surrounded by four pits, and larger structures probably communal or ceremonial, to one side or in the courtyard area."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_USMisSp][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Site plans gained greater internal complexity as houses clustered into court-yard groups and, toward [1000 CE], the southern pattern of civic-ceremonial centers with large earthen mounds was established in many places.
