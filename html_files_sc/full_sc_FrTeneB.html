Between 400-200 BCE agricultural burials were smaller, less differentiated.  No large towns on the scale of the Early Iron Age settlements.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_FrTeneB][MAJIDBENAM_BR]200 BCE, evidence for population expansion and increased urbanism[MAJIDBENAM_BR]However, there is evidence for population expansion in this period: from Celtic emigrations, from the warriors serving as mercenaries for Mediterranean states (a trend which declined c200 BCE) and the notable external military activity, such as on Etruscans, Rome (387 BCE) and Greece (Delphi 279-278 BCE). [MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_FrTeneB][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the 300-200 period there also is evidence for increased urbanisation from increased economic activity (universal coinage), long-distance trade (bridge building), and the rise of an urban aristocrat class who formed and could maintain a standing cavalry corps.

Supra-tribal level of cooperation: the clans of all the tribes together appointed 300 senators "to attend an annual assembly at a shrine." However they were rarely unified and eventually the chieftains became kings. The chieftains "were assisted by three military advisers and a judge."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_FrTeneB][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"At its lowest level, Celtic society was made up of extended families or clans that were grouped together to form territorially based tribes."
