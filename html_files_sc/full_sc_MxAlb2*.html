By MA II, expanded to include roughly 20,000km2.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_MxAlb2*] This includes roughly 2,150km2 of the Valley of Oaxaca, after the Zapotecs had defeated San Martin Tilcajete around 30 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_MxAlb2*] The place names recorded in the "conquest slabs" at Monte Alban can still be identified in some cases (as they are still called by those names) and may indicate that the territorial limits of the Zapotec state during this period were around 85-150km from Monte Alban.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_MxAlb2*] According to Charles Spencer (2009), nearly 20,000 km2: "At El Palenque, the presence of state institutions is supported by our excavation of a royal palace and a multiroom temple (Spencer and Redmond 2004b, 2005). Then, sometime in the first century B.C., in the early years of the Monte Albán II phase (100 B.C.-A.D. 200), the El Palenque site was burned and completely abandoned; a new site, Cerro Tilcajete, was founded on a nearby ridge. Elson’s (2003) research at Cerro Tilcajete revealed that it functioned as a secondary center of the Monte Albán state during the Monte Albán II phase, by which time Monte Albán had probably succeeded in annexing the Ocotlán-Zimatlán and Tlacolula subvalleys, as well as several other regions outside the Valley, bringing the territory dominated by the Monte Albán state to nearly 20,000 km2 (Fig. 5.9) (Elson 2003; Marcus and Flannery 1996:206-207; Spencer and Redmond 2005)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_MxAlb2*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ [40,000-50,000] ♥</b> People.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Table 4.1.

A similar but smaller structure (20m wide) has also been found at San José Mogote dating to this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_62_MxAlb2*] More generally, Charles Spencer commented: 'One cannot fail to be impressed by the amount and variety of public/institutional architecture constructed between B.C. 300 and A.D. 800 in and around the Main Plaza at Monte Alban. The archaeological data indicate that much of this architectural complexity was in existence by Monte Alban II (100 B.C. through A.D. 200). Many of these buildings do not appear to have been residential and most likely served an array of religious (e.g., the various structures associated with two-room temples), military (such as Building J and perhaps the Ballcourt), and other "administrative" functions (including a variety of other public/institutional buildings the functions of which are still unclear). At the same time, it is probably also appropriate to consider the quihuitao (royal palace) to be another example of a public/institutional building. Both the main candidate for a quihuitao at Monte Alban (the Patio Hundido complex, according to Flannery) and also the example recently excavated at El Palenque (which was probably the capital of a rival independent state polity in Late Formative times) near San Martin Tilcajete (see Spencer and Redmond 2004 in Lat Am Antiq, and Redmond and Spencer 2017 PNAS) were not associated with tombs like other elite (and non-elite) residences; also, both examples had "residential" as well as "ceremonial/governmental" components. Note that the El Palenque quihuitao is securely dated to the Late Monte Albán I phase (300-100 B.C.)'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_63_MxAlb2*]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Law">Law</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Formal legal code ♣ absent ♥</b> Sources do not suggest there is evidence for a formal legal system during this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_64_MxAlb2*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Judges ♣ absent ♥</b> Sources do not suggest there is evidence for a formal legal system during this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_65_MxAlb2*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Courts ♣ absent ♥</b> Sources do not suggest there is evidence for a formal legal system during this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_66_MxAlb2*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional Lawyers ♣ absent ♥</b> Sources do not suggest there is evidence for a formal legal system during this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_67_MxAlb2*]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Specialized_Buildings:_polity_owned">Specialized Buildings: polity owned</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ irrigation systems ♣ present ♥</b> There is some evidence for the use of irrigation systems during this period (for example, at Hierve el Agua), but the evidence suggests that the irrigation systems were constructed at a small scale, serving the land of only one or two communities.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_68_MxAlb2*][MAJIDBENAM_REF_69_MxAlb2*][MAJIDBENAM_REF_70_MxAlb2*] However, an irrigation system has been uncovered at La Coyotera in the Cuicatlan Canada during the Lomas phase (equivalent to MA Late I and II) which was likely constructed to fulfil Zapotec demands.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_71_MxAlb2*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ drinking water supply systems ♣ present ♥</b>A wall was built to dam a reservoir in the northern section of Monte Alban.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_72_MxAlb2*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ markets ♣ inferred present ♥</b> There is no direct evidence for marketplaces.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_73_MxAlb2*] However, increasing population numbers and product specialisation during this period, as well as the the access that different settlements had to a range of products suggest a trading system of a sort was present.
