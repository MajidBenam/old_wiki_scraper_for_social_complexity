"Now the clergy were organized in a hierarchical line under the direction of the pope, who could trump the power of local custom, tradition, and even episcopal power. Below the pope stood the bishop. Responsible for maintaining clerical discipline and for overseeing the property of the church, he was answerable only to the pope. Only he could perform all the sacraments; he alone performed the sacrament of confirmation and by the sacrament of ordination passed on his power to others. Theoretically, canon law held that he would be elected by the clergy and people of his diocese. In practice, he was elected only by the canon priests attached to the cathedral. Considered high clergy, the canons aided the bishop in furthering his agenda, administering the diocese and performing rituals at the cathedral church. At their head was the dean, the highest officer in the diocese. A diocesian chancellor supervised the cathedral school and issued licenses allowing clerics to teach and preach in the diocese. A treasurer oversaw finances, while a precentor managed the choir and organized the cathedral's musical program. Each diocese was divided into administrative districts, over which presided the archdeacons. Practically, these were powerful men; they were the bishop's legates, charged with enforcing discipline among the lower clergy, and therefore they were often quite unpopular. ...

Instead, many different (often competing) churches, structures, and people overlapped in the organization of local religious life." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_92_ItPapEM] "Actually, the most common type of church in the year 1000 was one founded - and governed - by a local lay lord rather than a bishop. ... It is impossible to calculate precisely how many of these churches there were, but they surely numbered in the tens of thousands. Indeed, they far outnumbered the Baptismal churches controlled by the bishops (many of which had passed into the hands of lay lords). ... Because of the force exerted by the ancient, hierarchical, episcopal Roman tradition, this model, which was based on German property law, never took root in central and southern Italy. ... Proprietary churches served very small communities, encompassing perhaps a village or two."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_93_ItPapEM][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/><b>♠ Military levels ♣ 6 ♥</b> levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"...men called magister militum or superista are attested off and on throughout the century; the papal militia had both military and ceremonial importance (see below, p.333), and these were its leaders. There were clearly several such leaders at anyone time, as the Liber Pontiﬁcalis makes clear in, for example, its account of the contested papal election of 855, and other senior military ﬁgures sometimes appear, such as Cesario (son of Sergio magister militum), ordinatus super exercitum in 849. A hierarchy of rank appears earlier in 855, when Daniele magister equitum accused Graziano, eminentissimus magistro militum et Romani palatii (or Romanae urbis) superista, clearly his superior, of disloyalty to the Carolingians, a charge he could not sustain. Apart from this, however, the structure of the military side of Rome’s aristocratic hierarchies is obscure to us. A set of military offices appear in a wide array of heterogeneous texts, but we cannot put them into a credible ordering. We can say, however, that it was normal to call senior military men nobiles, and Cesario di Sergio’s case shows that they had hereditary elements; we shall see in a moment how complex links between families were by 876. The terminology just outlined becomes much less common after the beginning of the tenth century, perhaps because the supreme military leaders were by now Tefilatto and his heirs; but two people are called superista under Alberico, and Otto III brieﬂy revived the ofﬁce of magister militiae. Formal military ofﬁces cease to be documented at all after that. All the same, military leadership, with or without titles, remained an important role for Rome’s aristocrats."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_94_ItPapEM][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/>1.

Rome fits this Italian pattern, then, although, as already noted, there are indications that placita were held even more often in Rome than they were in each county further north. It was clearly easy for Roman judges and aristocrats to come together frequently, and the more often they did so the more solid their political aggregation."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_106_ItPapEM][MAJIDBENAM_BR]It is unclear when it developed, but by long-standing custom, popes held a council in Rome itself during Lent to settle any ecclesiastical business (land disputes, lawsuits over rights, quarrels between bishops and their parish churches, etc.). In the late eleventh century, this system was expanded with another seasonal council held in November for the same purpose.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_107_ItPapEM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional Lawyers ♣ present ♥</b> "The point about these placita was thus that they were standardized occasions, run by high-status legal experts, the palatine judges, and legitimated more widely by Rome’s aristocracy. The whole of the city’s political society came together regularly and frequently to run justice, that is to say, and the choreography of each case, while it was on one level unique every time because every case was different, on another level had considerable regularities as well."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_108_ItPapEM][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Lawyers became an increasingly important part of the papal <i>curia</i> in the eleventh and twelfth centuries; the future pope Innocent III (r. 1198-1216) was a lawyer. Bologna, technically a part of the Patrimony, was the major center for legal scholarship in western Europe from the twelfth century onwards.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Specialized_Buildings:_polity_owned">Specialized Buildings: polity owned</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ irrigation systems ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Commercialization of rural hinterland began 1050-1100 CE. "This was the date of similar signs of agrarian development in eastern Lombardy, too, the hinterlands of Bergamo, Brescia, and Cremona. Here, François Menant points to the late eleventh and twelfth centuries as the moment of take-off for systematic irrigation, the development of vineyards on cleared land, the development of transhumant pastoralism, and, later in the twelfth century in the Cremonese, linen." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_109_ItPapEM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ drinking water supply systems ♣ present ♥</b> The papacy restored and maintained aqueducts (from c800), among other buildings, which at the time "certainly attest to the very great wealth of the papacy in the early Carolingian period, and to the preparedness of popes to spend that wealth very ambitiously." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_110_ItPapEM] Buildings and restorations mostly occurred in the early 9th century. After this time the code would be for the maintenance of these systems.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ markets ♣ present ♥</b>  "The Porticus was ... the location for nearly all Rome’s documented ergasteria or shops in our period."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_111_ItPapEM]  Civitas Leoniana was a market area. "What was being sold in the Civitas Leoniana? Food and drink, for sure; sex, doubtless, though it is not documented; lead and tin seals with portraits of the apostles Peter and Paul by 1199 at the latest, and so presumably the same array of religious trinkets that one can buy in and around piazza S. Pietro today. Our documents mention several negotientes, as actors or witnesses, as one would expect; a cambiator or money changer in 1083; and several food sellers of different types. Only a few artisans appear: workers in metal and cloth. This was, then, a commercial suburb, more than a productive one. The basilica gained the right not only to sell seals in 1199 but to have them made..."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_112_ItPapEM] Wickham's map of "Classical and secular buildings" also shows basilicas in the forum area.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_113_ItPapEM] These may indicate market areas.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ food storage sites ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Domuscultae from the eighth century was excavated and showed "a church and a substantial set of outbuildings, presumably largely for the storage of products."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_114_ItPapEM] "Rome, always a large city, needed to be fed, principally with grain; and it was fed from its hinterland from the eighth century at the latest into the late Middle Ages."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_115_ItPapEM]</div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Transport_infrastructure">Transport infrastructure</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Roads ♣ present ♥</b> Roads had existed and been maintained since Roman times.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Bridges ♣ present ♥</b> The popes maintained bridges across the Tiber; in other cities, such as Ravenna, the local bishops or secular officials did the same.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Canals ♣ absent ♥</b> There is no mention of the papacy or other powers undertaking canal works during this period; Roman-era canals had, by this point, most likely silted up.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ports ♣ present ♥</b> "Ripa was the name of the Tiber port area; to be exact, the east side was the Ripa Graeca, called Marmorata at its southern end under the Aventino, and the west side, in Trastevere, was the Ripa Romea."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_116_ItPapEM]</div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Special_purpose_sites">Special purpose sites</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Mines or quarries ♣ inferred present ♥</b> small quarries for stone?</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Information">Information</span></h3><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Writing_System">Writing System</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Mnemonic devices ♣ inferred present ♥</b> use of mnemonic devices in Latin instruction in the late Middle Ages.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Nonwritten records ♣ absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Written records ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Script ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Non-phonetic writing ♣ absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Phonetic alphabetic writing ♣ present ♥</b></div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Kinds_of_Written_Documents">Kinds of Written Documents</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Lists, tables, and classifications ♣ present ♥</b> Compiled starting in 1192 by Cencius.
