"Les sites archéologiques aujourd'hui associés au Funan sont répartis sur l'ensemble du delta et de la basse vallée du Mékong, des deux côtés de l'actuelle frontière khméro-vietnamienne. On sait par les sources chinoises et par l'épigraphie, confirmées aujourd'hui par les résultats des récentes fouilles archéologiques, qu'ils ont prospéré entre le Ier et le VIe siècle E.C. Les recherches rassemblées par Louis Malleret dans son Archéologie du Delta du Mékong restent à ce jour le point de départ obligé de toute étude archéologique des provinces méridionales du Viêt Nam. Cette somme est pour l'essentiel un inventaire systématique d'un ensemble de quelque trois cents gisements ayant produit une quantité variable, parfois minime, d'objets d'intérêt archéologique, allant de l'outil lithique au monument architectural, en passant par la céramique, la glyptique, la numismatique, l'épigraphie ou la statuaire."

In Khmer culture the world is divided into two landscapes that are marked by physical and psychological borders: the landscape of the village (srok) and the landscape of the wilderness (prei). The srok is the domesticated space of humans; the village, the paddy rice fields, a space of social organization [MAJIDBENAM_REF_91_KhFunaE] that is under the control of a Buddhist king  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_92_KhFunaE].

This division is not immutable: forests can be cleared to create new srok, and a village may be overtaken by the forest and regain its position as prei. This perception of the world has been identified as the pre-Indian stratum of Khmer culture [MAJIDBENAM_REF_95_KhFunaE].

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_98_KhFunaE] Sites like Angkor Borei have not yielded structures that may have been identified as indicators of violence. For example, the wall surrounding the city seems to have served as a "ring-road" and house placements rather than as a defensive structure.

This pattern encouraged communities, as they grew in size and popu- lation numbers, to control water flows, usually by build- ing up earthen dikes to form reservoirs. These banks ring many large Iron Age sites, and where dated, fall within 1 to 400 C.E. During the life of the states of FUNAN and CHENLA, water was retained in rectangular reservoirs known as BARAYS.

Since no similar cut portions of the Burma silver coins (or of any other coin- age from that era) have been recovered in Burma or Thailand, this evidence substantiates the Funan coast’s greater importance at this time, due to its need for smaller-denomination currency to sustain local exchange (Wicks: 1985, 196-99; Miksic: 2003a, 24).'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_185_KhFunaE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Indigenous coins ♣ absent ♥</b> 'The 1st to 5th century site of Oc Eo on Vietnam’s coast, then on the east-west maritime trade route, has produced, among other artefacts, a Vishnuite silver coin and a Roman gold medallion (Malleret 1959-62; Coe 2003; 66-67), but there is no evidence that Funan minted its own coinage (Sahai 1971: 94; Wicks 1992: 186).
