For the period before the conquest of the Niger Inland Delta, the Sultanate's limits "coincide[d] with the borders of the present-day Morocco"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_MaSaadi]. For the period between 1591 and 1618, the area of the Niger Inland Delta is added. Once the Sultanate lost control of the Delta, it is inferred that it returned to covering more or less the same area of modern-day Morocco.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ [2,000,000-3,000,000] ♥</b> People. 1591-1618: no data.

The figure of 3 million inhabitants corresponds to the earliest available population estimate for Morocco: this estimate dates to the early twentieth century, but "[t]he figure can hardly have been higher in the late sixteenth century or during the seventeenth, given that the country was subject to regular and devastating epidemics of plague"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_MaSaadi].
