Capital of Malkhed or Manyakheta. However, estimates are made difficult by the fact that the capital was destroyed by Chola armies in the tenth century CE, and what was left was subsequently destroyed by the armies of the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughals. Today, the Rashtrakuta capital is little more than a village. Not only that, but what little information exists on the city's heyday appears to be strongly influenced by Jain tradition, which may be biased, considering that Malkhed used to be a major centre for the religion [MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_InRasht].</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hierarchical_Complexity">Hierarchical Complexity</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ 3 ♥</b> levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Nowhere is a settlement hierarchy explicitly described, but it was probably roughly something like the following:[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1.

However, several sources allude to the importance, at least for some branches of the religion, of the relationship between student and teacher or guru (e.g. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_InRasht]), which suggests that perhaps it would not be entirely inappropriate to say that there is indeed a Hindu religious hierarchy, and that it is composed of two levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]_Jainism_[MAJIDBENAM_BR]NOTE: I have found two equally authoritative sources on Jain hierarchy:[MAJIDBENAM_BR](1) [MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_InRasht][MAJIDBENAM_BR]1. <i>Arihants</i> (ones who have conquered their inner enemies)<div>2. <i>Siddhas</i> (Liberated Ones)<div>3. <i>Acharyas</i> (who head the Order)<div>4. <i>Upadhyays</i> (who teach the message)<div>5. <i>Sadhus</i> (Monks/Seekers)</div></div></div></div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR](2) [MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_InRasht][MAJIDBENAM_BR]1.

Previously ordained monks enjoyed rights and privileges higher in status than monks ordained later, and monks were categorically of higher status and privilege than nuns. In effect seniority and gender provided criteria for social status and increased access to 'pure' teachings and exemption from 'impure' duties."
