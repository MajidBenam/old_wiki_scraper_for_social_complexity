This represents the range of single polity sizes (rather than the size of Canaan as a whole) taken from Finkelstein's estimates of the Middle Bronze Age period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_IlCanaa] In his reckoning, Akko had the smallest polity with c. 400 km^2, and Jerusalem the largest at about 2,850 km^2. Whether or not these polity sizes are accurate—and they may be overstating the case, since they assume that all the available territory is "claimed" rather than no-man's-land areas existing[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_IlCanaa]—they are certainly in the ballpark.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ [5,000-40,000]: 2000-1551 BCE; [5,000-60,000]: 1550-1175 BCE ♥</b> People, in a single polity. Estimate in the Middle Bronze Age taken from Finkelstein's estimate of the Canaanite "territorial units" (i.e. polities),[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_IlCanaa] with the upper boundary arbitrarily increased by 30% to account for methodological critiques of the estimating method. Finkelstein estimates his populations based on ground surveys of pottery remains and an assumed population density of 250 people per built-up hectare. However, the suitability of this assumption is not a given. "Some of the densities recently put forward for area coefficients have been based on unwalled, premodern villages…. How similar is such a village to a walled Bronze or Iron Age town or city? Although this is not a case of comparing apples and oranges (more like oranges and grapefruit), it seems probable that the economic constraints of building a defensive system put a permanent physical limit on the settlement area," leading to higher population densities.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_IlCanaa] "…the density coefficients employed by various population estimates of the Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Byzantine Period in the southern Levant using a figure of about 200-250 persons per hectare have been based upon data from observations in the old quarters of various Middle Eastern cities, towns, and villages in Iraq, Iran, and Syria (Finkelstein 1996; Broshi and Gophna 1986; Broshi 1979; Hassan 1981:66). Rather than assign an arbitrary density coefficient derived from a vastly different time period and culture, then simply applied to the overall measure of a settlement, more precise means should be used when seeking an accurate population estimate.… Basing a population estimate on the number houses, size of houses, members per household, and residential area of a site is essential for an accurate estimate because these figures can vary widely between sites, regions, and time periods."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_IlCanaa][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The upper bound in the Late Bronze Age is taken from Kennedy's estimate of Hazor (2013:328), increased by c. 20% to account for the built-up settlements within Hazor's territory but outside of Hazor proper.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_IlCanaa] There are several other population estimates that are significantly smaller, but I judge them to be less convincing. "In northern Canaan, there was an apparent trend of urbanization in the region of southern Lebanon between the Middle Bronze Age and the Late Bronze Age—the larger sites stayed occupied while some of the smaller sites became unoccupied in Late Bronze I (Marfoe 1998: 170).4 This may indicate an urbanization of the region rather than depopulation, and could be reflective of Canaan as a whole. The rise of city-states, known definitively from the Amarna Letters, could account for this demographic trend of urbanization.5 Yet, broad conclusions about the Late Bronze Age from limited archaeological data and studies have been drawn that claim the Late Bronze Age was a period of demographic decline and even increased nomadism."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_IlCanaa]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ [20,000-40,000]: 2000-1551 BCE; [45,000-50,000]: 1550-1175 BCE ♥</b> Inhabitants. Middle Bronze Age is taken from Finkelstein's (1992:211) estimate of the population of Shechem (with the upper bound inflated as above), which is judged to have been the largest settlement at the time.

Hence, in the highlands there were three tiers of settlements:[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"1) Modest, but well-fortified “capitals” at Jerusalem (ca. 4 to 5 ha?) and Shechem (ca. 4 ha) which were located approximately 50 km apart and were about 4 or more ha in size.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]2) Smaller, comparably fortified villages located along major routes through the highlands which included settlements like Abu Zarad (2 ha), Beth-El (2 ha), Beth-Zur (1.5 ha), Dothan (&lt; 4 ha), Far‘ah North (3.1 ha), Hebron (ca. 4.9 ha), Kheibar (2 ha), Marjama (3 ha), en-Najjar (2.5 ha), ‘Urma (1.5 ha), and Shiloh (1.7 ha) which were located within 30 km (a single day’s journey) of the larger centers and were usually less than 4 ha in size.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div>3) Small, rural settlements, most of which were unfortified, of less than 1 ha in size which filled in the landscape between the large and medium sized settlements."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_IlCanaa]</div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Kennedy[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_IlCanaa] adds three more levels:[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div><div><div>5) shrine site—smaller than a village, with primarily cultic activity and little population</div></div></div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div><div><div><div>6) outpost—small fortified sites with no evidence of residential use.</div></div></div></div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div><div><div><div><div>7) nomadic/seasonal site.</div></div></div></div></div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/><b>♠ Administrative levels ♣ unknown ♥</b> levels.

There would be a "commander of the chariots," and potentially subordinate commanders as well, above the actual charioteers and their shield-bearers. The infantry would be made up of elite soldiers, as well as peasant levies; the command structure is unknown. From the evidence of the Amarna Letters, we might infer that units of 100 men were extant—potentially as subdivisions of larger units of 400 men. Ugaritic sources also reference "commanders of a thousand," though Ugarit's army was relatively large.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Additionally, in Ugarit there were several specialized units outside of the normal command structure, such as "friends of the king."</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Professions">Professions</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional military officers ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional soldiers ♣ inferred present ♥</b> "Distinguishing elite from part-time warriors by different military gear is not an absolute matter.

Most importantly, in sharp contrast to both the Aegean and the entire ancient Near East, there is not a single indication that literate administration ever played any significant role in the [Middle Bronze Age] Canaanite economy."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_IlCanaa] Parallels are likely with the Weberian archetype of a royal household.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_IlCanaa]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Examination system ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Merit promotion ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Specialized government buildings ♣ present ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Law">Law</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Formal legal code ♣ present ♥</b> Two fragments of a larger clay tablet (designated Hazor 18) were discovered in 2010 at Tel Hazor, that would possibly have contained as many as 20 or 30 laws (which in turn could have been part of a larger collection of law tablets) in a format similar to the Code of Hammurabi.

An earlier tablet, Hazor 5, contains part of the description of a lawsuit, judged by the king personally.

Climactic conditions in areas such as the Huleh Valley were probably not sufficient for dry-farming, and feeding the growing population living in and around Hazor required the use of irrigation technology. Sealed, stone-built channels that diverted runoff water to exterior channels and moats were in use in cities such as Dan, Tel el-Ajjul, Tel Beit Mirsim, and Gezer. The stone-roofed canals found in the fields surrounding Hazor ran for several hundred meters in some instances."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_IlCanaa]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ drinking water supply systems ♣ present ♥</b> Water shafts likely dating to the Middle Bronze Age have been found at Megiddo and Gezer; a truly massive water tunnel was found at Hazor.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_IlCanaa]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ markets ♣ inferred present ♥</b> "…the antlers that were strewn along the southern side of the passageway [within the gatehouse of Tel Yafo] together with the vessels and seeds provide a glimpse into the role of the gate as a marketplace.

Furthermore, the quantity and conditions of the remains, because they showed no evidence of having been crushed, indicate that they were located in the gateway before the gate’s destruction, in either sacks or baskets of which no traces could be identified. The patterns of deposition were also not random but rather consisted of collections of types (e.g., olive pits, wheat, chickpeas). Seeds and artifacts recovered within the gate indicate that the Egyptian gate was not an exclusively defensive structure but that it also likely served as an administrative center (second story), a storage space (second story), and possibly a market (passageway)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_IlCanaa]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ food storage sites ♣ present ♥</b> For example, "Jaffa is also mentioned during the 14th century B.C.E. in the Amarna Letters and again during the 13th century B.C.E. in a letter from Ugarit to the Egyptian governor at the agricultural estate at Aphek.
