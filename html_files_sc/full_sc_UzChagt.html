[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_UzChagt] After Tarmashirin Khan's downfall in 1334 CE: "Although the eastern part of the Chaghadayid Khanate was now lost, the Ulus Chaghatay contained large new territories south of the Oxus: northeastern Khorasan and the regions of Qunduz, Baghlān, Kabul and Qandahar. Most of this area was the region of the Qara'unas, a large body of Turco-Mongolian troops (probably three tümens), which had originated as the garrison troops of Qunduz and Baghlān."

There, amirs (local Mongol chiefs) wielded the real power.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_UzChagt][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The administrative reform divided the country around Bukhara and Samarkand into tümens, and in Ferghana and East Turkistan into orchins (literally ‘near’, ‘around’, ‘surrounding’), i.e. a region located around the capital.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_UzChagt][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"At the time of Temür's rise to power, politics in the Ulus Chaghatay was controlled by the tribes who made it up. With the decline of central leadership, control over the territory and wealth of the Ulus had fallen to them. They provided most of the military manpower of the Ulus, either from their own tribesmen or from the armies of the regions under their control. No one therefore could either become or remain leader of the Ulus wihout the backing of the tribal leaders. Tribal chiefs naturally were not eager to strengthen the position of a central leader; they were intolerant of claims to sovereignty over them,and if a leader displeased them, they were quick to switch their loyalties to a rival candidate. Under these circumstances, central leadership was often contested, sometimes even after a leader had been acclaimed by the tribes of the Ulus." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_UzChagt][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The early Chaghadayid khans and their followers lived out in the steppe, but in the early fourteenth century the Chaghadayid Khan Kebeg (1318-1326) took up his residence in Transoxiana and began to take a more direct interest in the settled population. Kebeg undertook a number of reforms and is credited with organizing Transoxiana into tümens, regions supporting ten-thousand soldiers, of which seven were in the Samarqand region and nine in Ferghana.3" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_UzChagt][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/><b>♠ Religious levels ♣ [1-2] ♥</b> levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Many religions.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Military levels ♣ [4-6]: 1300 CE ♥</b> levels. <i>typically decimal system used.</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1.
