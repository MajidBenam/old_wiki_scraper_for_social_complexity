Knossos is the largest site of Prepalatial Crete. The estimated site size is about 20-37 hectares making Knossos the largest urban centre of the period. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_GrCrPre] Whitelaw estimated the Knossian population to 2,600 to 11,100 people (EM I-EM II: 2,600; EM III-MM IA: 6,000-11,100). The population of Phaistos, for the same period, is estimated to 1,660-5,400 souls and that of Malia to 1,500-3,190 souls.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_GrCrPre] The size of these sites is about 2 ha aside Knossos where a settlement of 5 ha already existed since the Final Neolithic period. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_GrCrPre] This settled scape is characterized by a considerable degree of regionalism which is expressed in material culture and social practices. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_GrCrPre] From the Early Minoan II onwards (2700-2200 BCE), the importance of coastal sites considerably increased while many inland sites seems to be abandoned. Monumental constructions appeared for the first time at Knossos, Malia, Phaistos, Tylissos, and Palaikastro. Many sites were destroyed or burned at the end of the period and this has been interpreted as the outcome of conflict between different social groups aspiring to political and economic power. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_GrCrPre] <b>2200-1900 BCE</b>: Settlement hierarchy change: nucleated villages seems less important and there is a new emphasis on mountain zones. Knossos, Malia and Phaistos increased considerably and become centers of a significant importance. The central monumental construction suggest the presence of a authority controlling the surrounding hinterland.  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_GrCrPre] These large centers and their supporting surrounding regions each form complex social, political and economic landscapes, in which larger regional-scale integrations could occur. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_GrCrPre]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Administrative levels ♣ [1-2] ♥</b> levels. 1: village heads and 2: town heads. It is generally argued that administration and writing were directly connected with the emergence of the first political institutions in 1900 BCE. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_GrCrPre] The direct object sealing from Myrtos Phournou Korifi and the discovery of dealings at Khania (2400-2200 BCE or 2200-2000 BCE), Khamalevri (2200-1900 BCE), Trypiti (2400-2200 BCE or 2200-2000 BCE), Malia (2400-2200 BCE), Psathi (2400-2200 or 2200-1900 BCE) and Mochlos shows that some kind of accounting system existed on Crete since the 2400-2200 BCE period. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_GrCrPre] Administrative systems, however, were less sophisticated that these adopted in Mainland Greece during the Early Helladic period (2700-2000 BCE). [MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_GrCrPre] Administration should be of a relatively low-level and locally relevant nature.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_GrCrPre]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious levels ♣1♥</b> levels.
