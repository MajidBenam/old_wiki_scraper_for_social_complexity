(1) Large cities, (2) smaller cities, (3) towns, (4) villages[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Large cities include the capital, Babylon, and others such as Ur, Eshnunna and Mari. They had monumental palaces and temples. After the collapse of the Ur III period, during the time of the city-state, religious centres had spread from Ur to the new city-states who established temples and religious centres of their own. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_IqBabAm][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Babylon and other major city-states were able to gain power by dominating smaller cities.  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_IqBabAm][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Tell Harmal, the site of the ancient town Shaduppum, was under the rule of Eshnunna during the petty state period. It had a town wall, temples (used for administration), shops and domestic houses.

After Babylon conquered Mesopotamia, the Babylonian king became superior to all other kings and district governors came into being.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Head Mayor and Chairman of the Assembly were positions elected by the Assembly. It is likely that the council of Elders were members of the Assembly from the most important houses, or most prominent positions, they were certainly superior. It is probable that any freeman or citizen could be part of the Assembly. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_IqBabAm] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_IqBabAm][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/><b>♠ Religious levels ♣ ♥</b> levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]There was significant religious reform in the Old Babylonian period. Where Enlil in Nippur was once the king of the Gods, the Amorites encouraged a wide spectrum of gods in the pantheon, of level importance. Many gods formed relationships with specific cities e.g. Nabu in Borsippa, Nergal in Kutha and Shamash in Sippar. Marduk of Babylon became the head of gods.

While it is considered to be heavy with propaganda it provides evidence for the presence of a law code, even if it cannot be certain how it was actually implemented at the time. There are certainly many contracts and court testimonies surviving to be sure that a law code was in existence and implemented. In particular, the <i> misharum </i> was "a short-term measure, apparently proclaimed orally rather than inscribed on monuments, designed to alleviate social and economic distress" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_IqBabAm]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Judges ♣ present ♥</b> Before Hammurabi, cases were heard by judges in individual cities. These judges appear to have been "ad hoc appointments", probably appointed from the council of elders. Hammurabi established himself as the head judge of the empire, though there existed officials called 'judges of the king' who probably made a substantial number of the judgements. In the provinces, the puhrum, elders and headman made judgements.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_IqBabAm] There were many merchants selling their own wares. Shepherds had their own flock and kept institutional animals, they were required to give a certain amount to the temple, but could sell the excess.
