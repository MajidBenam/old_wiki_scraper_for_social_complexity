It seems that the Majapahit structure of the ruler and a few top functionaries with varying influence was retained. There were various different titles for functionaries, but it is unclear whether there was a particular hierarchical structure between them, and moreover the relationship of these functionaries to powerful coastal regions, and the administrative structures within these regions, is far from clear and there was probably much fluidity and development over time.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_IdMatrm] Moertono shows that in later Mataram (possibly after the VOC came to dominate) there was a ligion including rendering justice in disputes under the jurisdiction of Islamic law. Thseparate and more independent department, the reh pangulon, which was responsible for matters of ree institution of the penggulu (head of the clergy in the main mosque in the king's capital) was gradually incorporated into the administrative system as head of a special division. The penggulu had his say about appointing lower penggulu naibs, who each administered the religious affairs of a certain number of villages. These lower officials were not thought of as belonging to the king's administration, for unlike other royal officials they did not receive income from the king.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_IdMatrm][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/><b>♠ Religious levels ♣ [1-3] ♥</b> levels. Moertono says that generally the Islamic clergy did not have an organized hierarchical structure in the sense of the Christian church. However, once religious specialists began to be more intertwined with the state administration in later Mataram, some hierarchies of power did develop (see 'Administrative Levels').[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_IdMatrm]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Military levels ♣ 5 ♥</b> levels.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_IdMatrm] Slaves used as auxiliaries.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_IdMatrm] Mataram often adopted fighting formations inspired by Indian astrological signs, including a huge crayfish. The feelers represented special troops of amok fighters, the body of the crayfish was the sovereign, preceded by sons and relatives, the commander and ministers, and other numbers represented troops of different nobles and officials.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_IdMatrm][MAJIDBENAM_BR]1.

Indigenous guardsmen in Mataram did not represent a true stipendiary force, for they received income from land allotments and sustenance from the food grown on these lands, but were not paid directly by the court. Reliance on land allotments meant that the standing army was just as affected by drought and famine as the general population.
