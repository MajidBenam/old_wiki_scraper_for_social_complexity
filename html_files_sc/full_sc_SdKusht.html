A more defensible scenario would instead posit Taharqo's immediate subordinates within the region as 'invisible elites' - merchants, pastoralists, and local potentates essential to the functioning of the state who neither held office within centralized institution nor manifested their wealth and influence through biographical inscriptions and private statuary. In this regard, Lower Nubia under the Twenty-Fifth Dynasty present a striking contrast with the bureaucratic formalization of Upper Egypt."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_65_SdKusht][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Semna West, Buhen, Qasr Ibrim, and Philae can be viewed primarily as loci for the 'formulation, demonstration, and explanation of royal authority' - i.e., as sites for the promotion of ritual suzerainty in lieu of centralized administration. ...

The marked contrast between this circumstance and the elaborate hierarchy of officialdom in Upper Egypt and Upper Nubia on either side would suggest that Lower Nubia was rather treated as a separate unit."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_67_SdKusht][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"the Kushite kings of the Napatan era were evidently not averse to delegating responsibility from afar - much as Taharqo appears to have done during the temple constructions at Kawa and Sanam."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_68_SdKusht][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Immediately below the king were the royal kinsmen (sn.w. nsw), from among whom the heir apparent was chosen by means of the Amun oracle."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_69_SdKusht][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Royal kinsmen "did not hold a monpoloy on upon the highest offices of government for as in Aspelta's Enthronement Stela the royal kinsmen were sent before the oracle by a separate group of commanders ..., palace officials ..., and 'friends'..."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_70_SdKusht] <i>Aspelta is post-25th Dynasty</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"a variety of more specific offices are attested, all clearly named after Egyptian precedents": these include Mayor, Palace Treasurer, Royal Sealer, Superior of the Tribunal, Chief Scribe, Royal Scribe, Overseer of the Gold of the Hill-Countries, Overseer of the Granary, Royal Scribe of the Granary, Scribe of the Temple-Compound, Sistrum-Player, Prohet, Great Priest, Chief Official of the God.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_71_SdKusht][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Inscriptional record suggests there was not a royal monopoly on these positions.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_72_SdKusht][MAJIDBENAM_BR]One analysis is "Upper Egypt was the Twenty-Fifth Dynasty state - the only Egyptian region in which Kushite hegemony approached the time-honored pharaonic ideal of centralized governance ... An alternative view ... articulated by Naunton ... Upper Egypt was not exceptional but rather microcosmic - even formative - for Kushitenherrschaft and its development over the course of the Twenty-Fifth Dynasty."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_73_SdKusht][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The Amun cult belonged in large part to the Kushite house, but the civil administration of Upper Egypt evidently did not."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_74_SdKusht][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Civil administration in Delta region, titles: "Grandee in the Towns of the East", "Grandee of the East", "Prophet of Bastet, mistress of Bubastis".

Authority appears instead to have been dispersed across a number of kin groups; there is odddly little pyramidal hierachy of governmental positions; and offices which might otherwise be equated with the king's unique deputy are found divided among several individuals."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_76_SdKusht] <i>this provides possible inferrence for 25th Dynasty</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"the most recent attempt at a comprehensive analysis of Theban officials and their duties during the Twenty-Fifth Dynasty has concluded that even in Upper Egypt 'it is not possible to speak of a "court" for the centuries following the New Kingdom,' as 'central authority and administration had disappeared' [quoting Naunton]"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_77_SdKusht][MAJIDBENAM_BR]O'Conner (1983)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_78_SdKusht][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Kushite rule was based on military strength, and local civil government was left largely to the Egyptian dynasts."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_79_SdKusht][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"At Thebes, the Kushites continued the politically useful office of 'god's wife'; the High Priesthood, held by a Kushite prince and his son, was revived but stripped of military and civil authority.
