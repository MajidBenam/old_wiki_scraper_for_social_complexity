Some authors place the origins of the Japanese state in the third century CE, with the emergence of a ‘tumulus culture’ centered in the Yamato area of west-central Honshu. Others look to the fifth century, when the Yamato polity began to display bureaucratic tendencies, or to the seventh, when it established centralized rule over most of Honshu, Kyushu, and Shikoku. However, the northern and southern extremes of the archipelago remained outside central control throughout much of the pre-modern period. Despite the early establishment of an identifiable state structure, later Japanese history is replete with examples of political fragmentation and multiple sovereignty...The name ‘Japan’ (Nippon) came into use around 700 CE, and it is possible that e´lites throughout the archipelago began to think of themselves as ‘Japanese’ at this time.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_JpNara*] 'The government in Nara, once it was established, used its army to gain control over more of Japan proper. In the extreme south of Kyushu partially assimilated communities (variously known as the Kumaso or Hayahito) were brought under control. In the north of Honshu, however, the Ainu people held out more strongly. Renowned as fierce fighting men, in 776 they stormed the main government fort at Taga, massacred the garrison, and invaded the settled regions to the south from which they had been expelled.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_JpNara*] 'Although the authority of the centralized state was accepted in far-flung parts of Japan, it was in the capital itself that its power could be seen to the best advantage. The attempt to build a city with the proportions of a Chinese capital was an ambitious one in the year 710. In fact Nara never seems to have been as large as its designers planned. For all that it fell short of its Chinese model, the building of the new capital must have helped to promote the unity of the country.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_JpNara*] at the beginning of the Nara period some areas of southern Kyushu still lay outside the district system. These were incorporated rather quickly, again as the result of military campaigns. For a time, the frontier zone actually extended beyond Kyushu to the islands in the south. One of these, Tane, was administered as a separate province during the eighth and early ninth centuries. However, during the Heian period the state seems to have lost all control over the southern islands—the southern terminus of Kyushu effectively marked the end to state territory.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_JpNara*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ [5,800,000-6,400,000]: 700 CE ♥</b>[5,800,000-6,400,000]: 730 CE.

(These four office titles were written with different characters but pronounced in the same way when held by officials serving in different ministries and agencies.) According to the Yoro adminstrative code of 718, the number of officials in the two councils and eight ministries totaled 331. If lower-ranking officials are added, the total was 6,487. Ranks provided a more precise indication of status than titles did, for officeholders with the same title had different ranks yielding different stipends and perquisites. The Taiho code set aside four imperial ranks (hon) for princes and near relatives of the emperor and thirty court ranks (kurai) for persons lower in the aristocratic order. The son or grandson of a nobleman holding the highest imperial rank was automatically awarded a junior fifth rank lower grade court rank when he reached the age of twenty-one. Special treatment for anyone with a fifth rank or above - apart from the rights that their sons had to a high rank when they turned twenty-one, irrespective of ability - is revealed by the generous stipends and retainers they received'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_JpNara*] 'The structure of the imperial court was a complex affair.
