Parsuas is here, as we shall attempt to show below, probably already a small kingdom inhabited by Iranian-speaking Persians. However, this is but a casual entry in the Assyrian annals; no other sources on Elam have come down to us from either the ninth or the greater part of the 8th century." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_IrNElm1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ ♥</b> People.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Before the Islamic conquest, major concentration of settlement were always localized in the following three major regions: the central Zagros, the lowland steppe, and Marv Dasht. These probably correspond, respectively, with Shimashki, Susa, and Anshan, the three most important historical entities in southwest Iran (Vallat 1980:6). Each major concentration of settlement contained at least one large urban area."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_IrNElm1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ ♥</b> Inhabitants.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hierarchical_Complexity">Hierarchical Complexity</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ [3-5] ♥</b> levels. The following polity, Neo-Elamites 2, had four levels. We can infer that the Neo Elamites 1 would have a similar range of settlement ranks.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1. Large cities. Susa. Madaktu, identified as Tepe Patak, a 6 ha site, although this is debated [MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_IrNElm1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]2. Small cities.

"En su saqueo del territorio elamita, allá por el año 646 a.C., nos dice que destruyó 14 ciudades reales, es decir principales, con sus territorios, 12 distritos y 20 ciudades de la frontera con Hidalu, en una distancia de 60 beru (entre 650 y 700 kms): “asolé Elam hasta su más lejana frontera,” dice. Otro texto del mismo rey asegura: “todo el país de Elam abatí como un diluvio,” confirmando así que recorrió todo el territorio elamita (Weidner 1931-32: 3)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_IrNElm1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Names of the royal cities: " Así podemos ver mencionadas las ciudades de Bitimbi, Naditu, Bit- bunaku, Hartabanu, Tubula, Madaktu, Haltemas, Susa, Dinsarri, Sumuntunas, Pidilma, Bubilu, Albinak, Duruntas, Hamanu, etc.11 Como las ciudades más fundamentales, es decir como ca- pitales o residencias reales nos encontramos con Madaktu.12 Luego están Susa, Bubilu y Hidalu que tiene su propio rey."

In fact, the dynasty consisted of a single ruler, Mar-biti-apla-usur (984-979 BC) who, in spite of his Akkadian name, was called 'remote (?) descenant of Elam' in the Dynastic Chronicle (Brinkman 1968: 165)." However, "there is no reason for either supposing that Mar-biti-apla-usur's reote affiliation with Ela was significant or that he had dealings with groups in western Iran."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_IrNElm1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Unknown, but a range of 3-5 would be reasonable considering what we know of the situation in the 7th century BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_IrNElm1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"During the third millennium B.C.E., the most important deity in Elam was the goddess Pinikir, 'the great mother of the gods to the Elamites' and the great mistress of heaven. Later, another goddess, Kirrisha, surpassed her, but many goddesses were gradually demoted and replaced in rank by male gods. Yet Kirrisha never lost her title as the main goddess of Elam, and it is significant for later developments that she married two of her brothers who were major gods. Kings often built temples to honor her and appear to her for protection. Despite being demoted, Elamite goddesses retained a higher status than goddesses in Mesopotamia."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_IrNElm1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Military levels ♣ [3-5] ♥</b> levels.
