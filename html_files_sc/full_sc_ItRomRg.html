Can reasonably infer population was less than 100,000 in 600 BCE. In the 150 years between c700 BCE and 550 BCE Rome acquired c200ha. On the basis of urban area, and a roughly proportional decrease based on Modelksi's 509 BCE estimate (we should remember that as cities acquire more area they generally acquire greater population density), we could infer a population in the region of 15,000-25,000 for 700 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The highest officers in the Roman military system were not professionals.

The hierarchy could also profit from land ownership. Professionalism of the priesthood likely pre-dates the Roman era as similar patterns are evident in Greek and Egyptian civilization. When the state provided gifts, it was often in the form of a lavish construction, such as a new temple.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_63_ItRomRg] The first coin minted in Rome occurred about 269 BCE (one in Neapolis produced coins slightly earlier, around 281 BCE) and the first state archives was created in 78 BCE.

Law thereafter was based on precedent. Our sources of knowledge of Roman law include the forensic speeches of Cicero; the Institutes of Gaius textbook (from 160 CE); and, much later, the sixth century CE Corpus Ius Civilis of Justinian. Wax tablets and papyri (contracts and wills etc.) also provide information on Roman law. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_64_ItRomRg] However, before this time restrictions on funerary extravagance, from the start of the 6th century, may suggest the Twelve Tables laws (of the Early Republic) codified an existing body of law and legal practices.

Local magistrates dealt with local matters, provincial governors dealt with provincial matters, and the praetors often dealt with cases in Rome. The Roman people could be duly convened as a final court of appeal in cases involving citizens.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Courts ♣ absent ♥</b> During the Roman Dominate administration of justice was "thoroughly bureaucratized" and "regular courts, special courts were established to deal with particular matters and categories of persons." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_67_ItRomRg] Before this time there was no specialised court building. Courts could be held in the basilicas[MAJIDBENAM_REF_68_ItRomRg] (introduced by the 3rd Century BCE[MAJIDBENAM_REF_69_ItRomRg]) where a provincial governor could an hold audience or in the Roman forum. Basilicas were multi-purpose buildings a place for banking and money-changing and town hall activities. The forum was a multi-purpose building which had existed since the Roman Kingdom.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional Lawyers ♣ absent ♥</b> Law specialists first existed during the Principate when they commanded fees for their expertise. We know this because Emperor Claudius attempted to "limit the fees of advocates, which had become intolerably heavy" to protect "women and other helpless litigants from the rapacity of their lawyers." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_70_ItRomRg] The first law school in Rome, for persons who wished to pursue career in the Imperial civil service, was established late second century CE. "Professional" lawyers replaced orators during the Roman Dominate period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_71_ItRomRg]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Specialized_Buildings:_polity_owned">Specialized Buildings: polity owned</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ irrigation systems ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Possibly unnecessary within Italy at this time due to sufficient rainfall.

Rome's mayoral office which supervised the import of grain, dates back to early days of the Roman Republic. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_77_ItRomRg] "The Republican stages of the Roman attempt to deal with storage problems are to some extent lost, because the material remains of most of the warehouses we have found belong to the Imperial period, but there are some clues." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_78_ItRomRg] From literary sources [Livy] it seems that the major development of Rome's river port and its attendant warehouses did not take place until the early second century B.C. Earlier the old Forum Boarium and Forum Holitorium in the centre of Rome seem to have coped with the main flow of imports which had probably come down the Tiber from the Italian hills."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_80_ItRomRg] The first paved road was the probably the Appian Way which dates to 312 BCE. In about 450 BCE the laws of the Twelve Tables, dated to approximately 450 BCE, issued regulations for the dimensions of roads. So at least from 450 BCE the pre-paved roads had maintenance work done of them. Due to the importance of the "salt road", however, it is likely this mud track had maintenance work during the Roman Kingdom.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Bridges ♣ present ♥</b> The first bridge thought to be the Pons Sublicius possibly in built 642 BCE under Ancus Marcius.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Canals ♣ absent ♥</b> The first canal is thought to have been built by Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (consul 187 BCE) to drain the lower Po region.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ports ♣ disputed_absent_present ♥</b> There was a port known as Caere 50km north west of Rome during the Roman Kingdom.
