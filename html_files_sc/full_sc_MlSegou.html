Next, there are Dendugu - literally 'son's villages - towns created by the king either to house his sons or to hold military garrisons commanded by the nobility. Finally, there are the Cikebugu: agricultural hamlets, normally founded by the state. The inhabitants of such hamlets were, notionally, resettled captives taken either in battle or in raids. Although termed slaves by outsiders, theirs was not a chattel status; rather they were more like serfs who were tied to a village and obliged to provide the Fama (ruler) with a disproportionate quantity of their produce."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_MlSegou]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Administrative levels ♣ 2 ♥</b> levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1.
