In 557 CE - 561 CE the Sasasanids annexed substantial territories, and in 565 CE the Goturks claimed the remainder and took a number of successor kingdoms as vassals.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The late ﬁfth and early sixth centuries saw the start of Hephthalite raids on Gandhara and  northern India.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Information is scarce, but recent discoveries have given evidence of what had been earlier only speculation. Islamic sources describe a series of disastrous campaigns by the Sassasian King Peroz that resulted in his eventual death.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_AfHepht] Following this victory, the Hepthalties secured control over Central Asia, Korasan and Afganistan from the Sassanian and Kushan Kingdoms.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_AfHepht] They continued to expand until the sixth century, when they were defeated by a recovered Sassasian Empire fighting alongside another confederation of central Asian nomads known as the Gokturks. This defeat destroyed Hepthalite power in transoxania, though some fragment of power seems to have existed until the Arab invasions.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_AfHepht]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ 26,500,000: 500 CE ♥</b>The total size of the Hephthalite population is unknown. In the territory of Tokharistan there were  reportedly 5,000-6,000 Hephthalite warriors. This could suggest a population of 50,000 individuals if the extended family groups were included, although this would have been experienced considerable ﬂuctuations with the increase and decrease of the number of affiliated tribes and fortune of the Hepthalite. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_AfHepht][MAJIDBENAM_BR]McEvedy and Jones (1978) 26,500,000: 500 CE [MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_AfHepht][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Russian Tukestan 1,000,000: 400-600 CE[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Pakistan, India and Bangladesh: 45,000,000: 400 CE; 50,000,000: 500 CE. In 200 BC approximately 40% in the Ganges Basin which would translate to 20m in 500 CE. Hephthalites held Upper and Middle Gangers Basin so perhaps two-thirds (13m) under Hephthalite control. Indus Basin likely to have been next most populous part of Indian sub-continent at this time. If 25% of the total: 12.5m.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ ♥</b>Likely to be Samarkand? &lt; 50,000[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The Suishu tells us that the capital city of the Hephthalites measured about 10 Chinese miles square."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_AfHepht][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Toramana, who made conquests in India "established his capital city at Salaka, and in a brief time Salaka grew into a metropolis, 'a great centre of trade'." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_AfHepht][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Questions of King Milinda on Salaka: "in parks and gardens and groves and lakes and tanks, a paradise of rivers and mountains and woods. Wise architects have laid it out ... strong towers and ramparts, with superb gates and entrance archways; and with the royal citadel in its midst, white walled and deeply moated. Well laid out are its streets, squares, cross roads, and market places. ... And there is laid up there much store of property and corn and things of value in warehouses - foods and drinks of every sort, syrups and sweetmeats of every kind."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_AfHepht][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"one of the largest towns was Balkh... had about 100 Buddhist vihāras (monasteries) and some 3000 monks." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_AfHepht][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Balkh, Termez, and Budrach were other cities in the territory, but the actual number of inhabitants in unknown. A Chinese observer remarked that the cities were heavily fortified but not densely populated.

The area of the 'town' is 10 ha. The area of the town plus suburb is 70 ha.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_42_AfHepht][MAJIDBENAM_BR]2.  Subjugated  agricultural villages[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div>3.

This was the case in Chaganiyan, on the upper and middle reaches of the Surkhan Darya. There is some speculation that local administrative structures were maintained, but this does not have enough evidence for anything beyond the extraction of tribute. There is also some limited evidence of the titles of officials from gemstones. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_47_AfHepht][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Small family landholdings[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Fraternal polyandry marriage "it was the custom for women to adorn their hats with horns, one per husband." "If a man had no brothers he would often adopt another man so as to be able to marry." More recently Tibetans who practiced this form of marriage did it "to make sure that small family landholdings did not have to be divided among brothers. Instead all male offspring remained on their parents' land and worked it together as a single landholding. This system also limits population growth significantly since each generation produces the children of only one woman instead of offspring from the wives of all brothers." However, since the Hephthalite nomads did not have family farms they may have practiced this form of marriage for keeping the herds together and population control. Chinese records don't mention status of the presumably many unmarried Hephthalite women.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_48_AfHepht][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/><b>♠ Religious levels ♣ 1 ♥</b>The city of Balkh had about 100 Buddhist monasteries and some 3,000 monks. Outside the town was a large Buddhist monastery, although this description occurs after the area had been conquered by the Turks. Buddhism, Zoroastrianism,  Christianity, a Sun cult and some kind of sky and fire worship are also attested. However, we have no information as to what the Hepthalites practiced, and whether this had a hierarchical structure.  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_49_AfHepht][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"There is some evidence that Buddhism was practices in some of the territories held by the Hephthalites; however, some contemporary authors also wrote of the persecution of Buddhists. There are references to sacred fire, which indicates at least some familiarity with Zoroastrianism. However, because Hephthalite graves have been found, not all aspects of Zoroastrianism would have been practiced, since the funerary ritual of this religion, entailed leaving the body in the open to be devoured by sacred birds and dogs.
