The archaeological data indicate that much of this architectural complexity was in existence by Monte Alban II (100 B.C. through A.D. 200). Many of these buildings do not appear to have been residential and most likely served an array of religious (e.g., the various structures associated with two-room temples), military (such as Building J and perhaps the Ballcourt), and other "administrative" functions (including a variety of other public/institutional buildings the functions of which are still unclear). At the same time, it is probably also appropriate to consider the quihuitao (royal palace) to be another example of a public/institutional building. Both the main candidate for a quihuitao at Monte Alban (the Patio Hundido complex, according to Flannery) and also the example recently excavated at El Palenque (which was probably the capital of a rival independent state polity in Late Formative times) near San Martin Tilcajete (see Spencer and Redmond 2004 in Lat Am Antiq, and Redmond and Spencer 2017 PNAS) were not associated with tombs like other elite (and non-elite) residences; also, both examples had "residential" as well as "ceremonial/governmental" components. Note that the El Palenque quihuitao is securely dated to the Late Monte Albán I phase (300-100 B.C.)'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_68_MxAlb3A]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Law">Law</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Formal legal code ♣ absent ♥</b> Sources do not suggest there is evidence for a formal legal system during this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_69_MxAlb3A]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Judges ♣ absent ♥</b> Sources do not suggest there is evidence for a formal legal system during this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_70_MxAlb3A]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Courts ♣ absent ♥</b> Sources do not suggest there is evidence for a formal legal system during this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_71_MxAlb3A]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional Lawyers ♣ absent ♥</b> Sources do not suggest there is evidence for a formal legal system during this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_72_MxAlb3A]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Specialized_Buildings:_polity_owned">Specialized Buildings: polity owned</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ irrigation systems ♣ present ♥</b> There is some evidence for the use of irrigation systems during this period, but the evidence suggests that the irrigation systems were constructed at a small scale.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_73_MxAlb3A][MAJIDBENAM_REF_74_MxAlb3A] How much was polity owned is therefore difficult to determine.
