These included the protectores et domestici ('corps of officer cadets').[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_ItRomWe] A former body called a consistorum that 'consisted of any individual ministers that the emperor wanted to consult about a specific topic' became 'a formal body with specific duties'. The Western Emperor did not control the army. 'In the West, as time passed the command of the army moved away from the emperor and devolved upon the newly created magister peditum ('master of the infantry') and magister equitum ('master of the cavalry'). In the course of time the magister peditum became the more senior of the two posts.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_ItRomWe] Laws came from imperial decree which 'were in form, with only the rarest of exceptions, letters, almost always addressed to officials, occasionally to the Senate. This is true of both western and eastern legislation'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_ItRomWe] Below the Emperors were praetorian prefects who 'acted as the emperor's representatives, governing in his name with legal, administrative and financial powers.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_ItRomWe][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Roman bureaucracy was comparable in size to that of Constantinople. 'Viewed through the baroque rhetoric of a text like the Variae the bureaucracy appears hierarchically complex and numerous, and indeed gives the impression of being on par with the eastern civil service. The swelling of governmental apparatus and personnel was certainly one of the defining features of late antique society. By the end of the 4th century the state provided civil positions for an estimated 40,000 across the empire.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_ItRomWe] The ministers of state included the magister officiorum ('master of offices'); the comes sacrarum largitionum ('count of the sacred largesses') who controlled finances, mines, mints, "and all revenue and expenditure in coin"; agents in rebus ('imperial couriers'), scholae ('imperial body guard'), officia dispositionum and admissionum (timetable and audiences for the emperor) under magister officiorum.

Each Augustus had his own Caesar (deputy and successor) to help run his half of the empire. As part of the bureaucratic system, each of the four co-rulers had a Praefectus Praetorio (Praetorian Prefect) to help with the administration of his 'quarter' of the empire. Each Praefectus wielded great power and could readily influence military affairs, as he retained control of the main logistical system of the empire. Although abandoned on the death of Diocletian, the system of using four Praefecti was revived under Constantine. As time passed the position of prefect became more influential, especially that of the two prefects in charge of the two imperial capitals."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_ItRomWe][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/><b>♠ Religious levels ♣ 8 ♥</b> levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Theodosius (r.379-395), made Christianity the legal or "official" religion of the empire."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_ItRomWe][MAJIDBENAM_BR]1. Bishop of a patriarchate[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The churches organized themselves along the lines laid down by the geography and political order of the empire. A city (civitas), along with its surrounding rural perimeter, the foundation of imperial organization, also formed the basic unit of ecclesiastical structure. Virtually every Roman city, many of them quite small, had its own bishop. He exercised his authority over a "diocese" that ordinarily coincided with the boundaries of the civitas. These dioceses were then grouped into provinces, over which a metropolitan, the bishop of a province's principal city, held sway. Eventually, provinces themselves were organized into large "patriarchates," each lead by one of the five preeminent bishops of the church: those in Rome, Constantinople (called "New Rome," second in prestige to the Old), Antioch, Alexandria, and Jerusalem."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_ItRomWe][MAJIDBENAM_BR]2.

Presbyters or priests (elders)<div>"Evidence from the second century suggests that a wide variety of models for local clergy existed throughout the Roman Empire. Yet the one to prevail was a three-tiered, hierarchical. In this model, the bishop served as leader of the local community and was assisted by presbyters or priests (elders) and deacons. Again, this model was established in the Antioch of Ignatius, as he underscores emphatically the necessity of gathering for learning, ritual, and teaching around a single bishop. By the end of the century this three-tiered form of ministry had spread to most early Catholic communities throughout the empire, and it would soon become the sole authoritative manner of organizing local ecclesial communities."

The imperial jurists distinguished the ius civile, the law of the civitas from the ius gentium, law of the peoples, and the ius naturale, the law of nature. The ius gentium did not refer to anything approximating to international law, but rather to the things that the Roman ius civile had in common with the usages of other peoples."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_44_ItRomWe][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Writing c200 CE "Papinian, perhaps the authority on law most respected in late antiquity, listed the sources of the ius civile as statutes (leges), popular resolutions (plebiscita), senatorial enactments (senatusconsulta), decrees of emperors (decreta principum) and the authoritative pronouncements of men learned in law, the jurists (auctoritas prudentium). To these was added the ius honorarium, the law contained in the Edict of the praetor, who, under the Republic and Early Empire administered law in Rome; this form of law derived its name from the praetor's magistracy (honos) and was held to 'assist, supplement or amend' the ius civile.".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_45_ItRomWe]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Judges ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Courts ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional Lawyers ♣ present ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Specialized_Buildings:_polity_owned">Specialized Buildings: polity owned</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ irrigation systems ♣  ♥</b> "Like the early irrigation ditches in Italy, the gold and silver mines received considerable attention when they first started producing, but after the second century they are seldom mentioned."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_46_ItRomWe]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ drinking water supply systems ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ markets ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ food storage sites ♣ present ♥</b></div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Transport_infrastructure">Transport infrastructure</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Roads ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Bridges ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Canals ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ports ♣ present ♥</b></div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Special_purpose_sites">Special purpose sites</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Mines or quarries ♣ present ♥</b> "Like the early irrigation ditches in Italy, the gold and silver mines received considerable attention when they first started producing, but after the second century they are seldom mentioned."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_47_ItRomWe] "In the middle of the third century AD, Cyprian wrote that, 'the metals are nearly exhausted.'
