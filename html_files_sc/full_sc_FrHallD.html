[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_FrHallD][MAJIDBENAM_BR][MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_FrHallD][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Territorial scale: "The economic foundations put in place in the ninth and eighth centuries BC were ... incapable of supporting a political scale of integration greater than tens of square kilometers." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_FrHallD][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The primacy of this site was short-lived, but by Hallstatt D2 Asperg and the Heuneburg had become centres of ‘complex chiefdoms.’ Within a 5- 10km radius of a central defended site is a cluster of rich burials, characterised by massive mounds, timber-lined graves, wagons, gold objects, bronze vessels, and imported Mediterranean goods."

"Rather than a small hillfort of just a few hectares, as once believed, we can now see that in the first half of the 6th century BC Heuneburg was an enormous settlement of 100 ha and at least 5,000 inhabitants."

The increase in social complexity does not seem to have survived the late Hallstatt/early La Tene transition, although the late La Tene Viereckschanzen and relatively rapid appearance of many Late Lat Tene oppida from a dispersed settlement base (Murray forthcoming) indicate that continuity was maintained throughout this time."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_FrHallD][MAJIDBENAM_BR]relationship between small dispersed settlements and hilltop settlements unclear [MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_FrHallD]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Administrative levels ♣ [3-4] ♥</b> levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"In their influential paper, Frankenstein and Rowlands [propose] the existence of a four-tiered hierarchy of chieftains, consisting of a paramount chieftain, "vassal chiefs," "sub-chiefs," and "village chiefs." Bintliff (1984) agreed with this suggesting "the spacing of centres suggests large territories and even "proto-state" structures, to be linked perhaps to the emergence of paramount chiefs or princes from an aristocratic stratum scattered throughout the region. The paramounts associated with the major putative centres and their particularly impressive burials, seem to have dominated numerous district chiefs whose rich tumuli are found at various points around the suggested territory of each princedom."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_FrHallD][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/>1.
