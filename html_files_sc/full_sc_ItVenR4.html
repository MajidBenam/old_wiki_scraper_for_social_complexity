The apex of the constituional system - the doge, the Provveditori di San Marco, the ducal councilors, the Savi del Consiglio - thus came to be subjected to a form of continuous supervision. In 1453, for example, the avogadori were able to block an order from the Doge to the Giudici di Petizion."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_ItVenR4][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The much enlarged imperial territories that thus accrued to the Venetian state after 1204 had to be governed somehow. In Corfu briefly, and in Crete more permanently, the Venetians resorted to the form of military administration used by all the Latin crusading states. That is, the city granted fiefs to knights and serjeants who undertook to build castles and defend the land in return for the income to be derived from territories granted to them. Holders of these fiefs were all Venetian citizens; their lands came by confiscation from Greek magnates."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_ItVenR4][MAJIDBENAM_BR]1200 CE: "a bailo was appointed to supervise Venetian affairs along the entire Syrian and Palestinian coast."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_ItVenR4]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious levels ♣ 5 ♥</b>  The Venetian religious policy "expected the Greeks to abandon their traditional form of Christianity and accept Latin rites and doctrines."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_ItVenR4][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Using same code as for Papal States of this period, which was coded and referenced by our expert Joe Figliulo-Rosswurm.</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Pope; Cardinals and legates; archbishops; bishops and abbots; parish priests and members of the religious orders; deacons.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1. Pope: The pope was, of course, the universally-acknowledged leader of Latin Christendom. This does not contradict the fact that who exactly was the legitimate pope was often contested during the period 1378-1418, during the Great Schism. During this period the papacy arrogated to itself the right to appoint bishops, negating the tradition of bishops being elected by their flock in conjunction with the priesthood.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_ItVenR4][MAJIDBENAM_BR]2. Cardinals and legates: The cardinalate was crucial in theological decision-making and the religious aspects of papal government; legates, similarly, handled religious matters abroad on occasion.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div>3. Archbishops: To a certain extent, archbishops were equivalent to cardinals, but there were more of them, distributed throughout Christendom. They supervised their suffragan bishops and bishoprics, while also overseeing their own (a good example is the Archbishop of Milan).</div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div><div>4. Bishops and abbots: Bishops were the crucial link between local religion and the papacy. There were 263 bishoprics in  14th century Italy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_ItVenR4] Abbots sometimes played a role beyond the walls of their monasteries, although by this point once-powerful regional centers such as Farfa were in decline in Lazio.</div></div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div><div><div>5. Parish priests and members of the religious orders: These constituted the mundane religious level. Parish priests embodied Christianity for their flock, for the most part, since they said Mass, heard confession and, in general, were (supposed to) serve as the quotidian face of the organized Church. Members of the religious orders (Franciscans, Dominicans, and so forth) also were a common part of the Church's presence, especially in the towns.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_ItVenR4]</div></div></div></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Military levels ♣ 11 ♥</b> levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Military Administration 1509-1617[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_ItVenR4][MAJIDBENAM_BR]1.
